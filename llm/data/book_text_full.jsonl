{"2": "\nCHAPTER I.\r\nBRETTON.\n\r\nMy godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of\r\nBretton. Her husband\u2019s family had been residents there for generations, and\r\nbore, indeed, the name of their birthplace\u2014Bretton of Bretton: whether by\r\ncoincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient\r\nimportance to leave his name to his neighbourhood, I know not.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I liked the\r\nvisit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The large peaceful rooms,\r\nthe well-arranged furniture, the clear wide windows, the balcony outside,\r\nlooking down on a fine antique street, where Sundays and holidays seemed always\r\nto abide\u2014so quiet was its atmosphere, so clean its pavement\u2014these things\r\npleased me well.\r\n\n\r\nOne child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of, and in a\r\nquiet way I was a good deal taken notice of by Mrs. Bretton, who had been left\r\na widow, with one son, before I knew her; her husband, a physician, having died\r\nwhile she was yet a young and handsome woman.\r\n\n\r\nShe was not young, as I remember her, but she was still handsome, tall,\r\nwell-made, and though dark for an Englishwoman, yet wearing always the\r\nclearness of health in her brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair of fine,\r\ncheerful black eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that she had not\r\nconferred her complexion on her son, whose eyes were blue\u2014though, even in\r\nboyhood, very piercing\u2014and the colour of his long hair such as friends did not\r\nventure to specify, except as the sun shone on it, when they called it golden.\r\nHe inherited the lines of his mother\u2019s features, however; also her good teeth,\r\nher stature (or the promise of her stature, for he was not yet full-grown),\r\nand, what was better, her health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and\r\nequality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.\r\n\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year \u2014\u2014 I was staying at Bretton; my godmother having come\r\nin person to claim me of the kinsfolk with whom was at that time fixed my\r\npermanent residence. I believe she then plainly saw events coming, whose very\r\nshadow I scarce guessed; yet of which the faint suspicion sufficed to impart\r\nunsettled sadness, and made me glad to change scene and society.\r\n\n\r\nTime always flowed smoothly for me at my godmother\u2019s side; not with tumultuous\r\nswiftness, but blandly, like the gliding of a full river through a plain. My\r\nvisits to her resembled the sojourn of Christian and Hopeful beside a certain\r\npleasant stream, with \u201cgreen trees on each bank, and meadows beautified with\r\nlilies all the year round.\u201d The charm of variety there was not, nor the\r\nexcitement of incident; but I liked peace so well, and sought stimulus so\r\nlittle, that when the latter came I almost felt it a disturbance, and wished\r\nrather it had still held aloof.\r\n\n\r\nOne day a letter was received of which the contents evidently caused Mrs.\r\nBretton surprise and some concern. I thought at first it was from home, and\r\ntrembled, expecting I know not what disastrous communication: to me, however,\r\nno reference was made, and the cloud seemed to pass.\r\n\n\r\nThe next day, on my return from a long walk, I found, as I entered my bedroom,\r\nan unexpected change. In addition to my own French bed in its shady recess,\r\nappeared in a corner a small crib, draped with white; and in addition to my\r\nmahogany chest of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood chest. I stood still, gazed,\r\nand considered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf what are these things the signs and tokens?\u201d I asked. The answer was\r\nobvious. \u201cA second guest is coming: Mrs. Bretton expects other visitors.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn descending to dinner, explanations ensued. A little girl, I was told, would\r\nshortly be my companion: the daughter of a friend and distant relation of the\r\nlate Dr. Bretton\u2019s. This little girl, it was added, had recently lost her\r\nmother; though, indeed, Mrs. Bretton ere long subjoined, the loss was not so\r\ngreat as might at first appear. Mrs. Home (Home it seems was the name) had been\r\na very pretty, but a giddy, careless woman, who had neglected her child, and\r\ndisappointed and disheartened her husband. So far from congenial had the union\r\nproved, that separation at last ensued\u2014separation by mutual consent, not after\r\nany legal process. Soon after this event, the lady having over-exerted herself\r\nat a ball, caught cold, took a fever, and died after a very brief illness. Her\r\nhusband, naturally a man of very sensitive feelings, and shocked inexpressibly\r\nby too sudden communication of the news, could hardly, it seems, now be\r\npersuaded but that some over-severity on his part\u2014some deficiency in patience\r\nand indulgence\u2014had contributed to hasten her end. He had brooded over this idea\r\ntill his spirits were seriously affected; the medical men insisted on\r\ntravelling being tried as a remedy, and meanwhile Mrs. Bretton had offered to\r\ntake charge of his little girl. \u201cAnd I hope,\u201d added my godmother in conclusion,\r\n\u201cthe child will not be like her mamma; as silly and frivolous a little flirt as\r\never sensible man was weak enough to marry. For,\u201d said she, \u201cMr. Home is\r\na sensible man in his way, though not very practical: he is fond of science,\r\nand lives half his life in a laboratory trying experiments\u2014a thing his\r\nbutterfly wife could neither comprehend nor endure; and indeed\u201d confessed my\r\ngodmother, \u201cI should not have liked it myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn answer to a question of mine, she further informed me that her late husband\r\nused to say, Mr. Home had derived this scientific turn from a maternal uncle, a\r\nFrench savant; for he came, it seems; of mixed French and Scottish origin, and\r\nhad connections now living in France, of whom more than one wrote de\r\nbefore his name, and called himself noble.\r\n\n\r\nThat same evening at nine o\u2019clock, a servant was despatched to meet the coach\r\nby which our little visitor was expected. Mrs. Bretton and I sat alone in the\r\ndrawing-room waiting her coming; John Graham Bretton being absent on a visit to\r\none of his schoolfellows who lived in the country. My godmother read the\r\nevening paper while she waited; I sewed. It was a wet night; the rain lashed\r\nthe panes, and the wind sounded angry and restless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor child!\u201d said Mrs. Bretton from time to time. \u201cWhat weather for her\r\njourney! I wish she were safe here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA little before ten the door-bell announced Warren\u2019s return. No sooner was the\r\ndoor opened than I ran down into the hall; there lay a trunk and some\r\nband-boxes, beside them stood a person like a nurse-girl, and at the foot of\r\nthe staircase was Warren with a shawled bundle in his arms.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that the child?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI would have opened the shawl, and tried to get a peep at the face, but it was\r\nhastily turned from me to Warren\u2019s shoulder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut me down, please,\u201d said a small voice when Warren opened the drawing-room\r\ndoor, \u201cand take off this shawl,\u201d continued the speaker, extracting with its\r\nminute hand the pin, and with a sort of fastidious haste doffing the clumsy\r\nwrapping. The creature which now appeared made a deft attempt to fold the\r\nshawl; but the drapery was much too heavy and large to be sustained or wielded\r\nby those hands and arms. \u201cGive it to Harriet, please,\u201d was then the direction,\r\n\u201cand she can put it away.\u201d This said, it turned and fixed its eyes on Mrs.\r\nBretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome here, little dear,\u201d said that lady. \u201cCome and let me see if you are cold\r\nand damp: come and let me warm you at the fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe child advanced promptly. Relieved of her wrapping, she appeared exceedingly\r\ntiny; but was a neat, completely-fashioned little figure, light, slight, and\r\nstraight. Seated on my godmother\u2019s ample lap, she looked a mere doll; her neck,\r\ndelicate as wax, her head of silky curls, increased, I thought, the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton talked in little fond phrases as she chafed the child\u2019s hands,\r\narms, and feet; first she was considered with a wistful gaze, but soon a smile\r\nanswered her. Mrs. Bretton was not generally a caressing woman: even with her\r\ndeeply-cherished son, her manner was rarely sentimental, often the reverse; but\r\nwhen the small stranger smiled at her, she kissed it, asking, \u201cWhat is my\r\nlittle one\u2019s name?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMissy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut besides Missy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly, papa calls her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill Polly be content to live with me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always; but till papa comes home. Papa is gone away.\u201d She shook her\r\nhead expressively.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe will return to Polly, or send for her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he, ma\u2019am? Do you know he will?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Harriet thinks not: at least not for a long while. He is ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer eyes filled. She drew her hand from Mrs. Bretton\u2019s and made a movement to\r\nleave her lap; it was at first resisted, but she said\u2014\u201cPlease, I wish to go: I\r\ncan sit on a stool.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe was allowed to slip down from the knee, and taking a footstool, she carried\r\nit to a corner where the shade was deep, and there seated herself. Mrs.\r\nBretton, though a commanding, and in grave matters even a peremptory woman, was\r\noften passive in trifles: she allowed the child her way. She said to me, \u201cTake\r\nno notice at present.\u201d But I did take notice: I watched Polly rest her small\r\nelbow on her small knee, her head on her hand; I observed her draw a square\r\ninch or two of pocket-handkerchief from the doll-pocket of her doll-skirt, and\r\nthen I heard her weep. Other children in grief or pain cry aloud, without shame\r\nor restraint; but this being wept: the tiniest occasional sniff testified to\r\nher emotion. Mrs. Bretton did not hear it: which was quite as well. Ere long, a\r\nvoice, issuing from the corner, demanded\u2014\u201cMay the bell be rung for Harriet!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rang; the nurse was summoned and came.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHarriet, I must be put to bed,\u201d said her little mistress. \u201cYou must ask where\r\nmy bed is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHarriet signified that she had already made that inquiry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAsk if you sleep with me, Harriet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Missy,\u201d said the nurse: \u201cyou are to share this young lady\u2019s room,\u201d\r\ndesignating me.\r\n\n\r\nMissy did not leave her seat, but I saw her eyes seek me. After some minutes\u2019\r\nsilent scrutiny, she emerged from her corner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish you, ma\u2019am, good night,\u201d said she to Mrs. Bretton; but she passed me\r\nmute.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Polly,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo need to say good-night, since we sleep in the same chamber,\u201d was the reply,\r\nwith which she vanished from the drawing-room. We heard Harriet propose to\r\ncarry her up-stairs. \u201cNo need,\u201d was again her answer\u2014\u201cno need, no need:\u201d and\r\nher small step toiled wearily up the staircase.\r\n\n\r\nOn going to bed an hour afterwards, I found her still wide awake. She had\r\narranged her pillows so as to support her little person in a sitting posture:\r\nher hands, placed one within the other, rested quietly on the sheet, with an\r\nold-fashioned calm most unchildlike. I abstained from speaking to her for some\r\ntime, but just before extinguishing the light, I recommended her to lie down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy and by,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will take cold, Missy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe took some tiny article of raiment from the chair at her crib side, and with\r\nit covered her shoulders. I suffered her to do as she pleased. Listening awhile\r\nin the darkness, I was aware that she still wept,\u2014wept under restraint, quietly\r\nand cautiously.\r\n\n\r\nOn awaking with daylight, a trickling of water caught my ear. Behold! there she\r\nwas risen and mounted on a stool near the washstand, with pains and difficulty\r\ninclining the ewer (which she could not lift) so as to pour its contents into\r\nthe basin. It was curious to watch her as she washed and dressed, so small,\r\nbusy, and noiseless. Evidently she was little accustomed to perform her own\r\ntoilet; and the buttons, strings, hooks and eyes, offered difficulties which\r\nshe encountered with a perseverance good to witness. She folded her\r\nnight-dress, she smoothed the drapery of her couch quite neatly; withdrawing\r\ninto a corner, where the sweep of the white curtain concealed her, she became\r\nstill. I half rose, and advanced my head to see how she was occupied. On her\r\nknees, with her forehead bent on her hands, I perceived that she was praying.\r\n\n\r\nHer nurse tapped at the door. She started up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am dressed, Harriet,\u201d said she; \u201cI have dressed myself, but I do not feel\r\nneat. Make me neat!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you dress yourself, Missy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush! speak low, Harriet, for fear of waking the girl\u201d (meaning me, who\r\nnow lay with my eyes shut). \u201cI dressed myself to learn, against the time you\r\nleave me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are cross, I have many a time wanted you to go, but not now. Tie my\r\nsash straight; make my hair smooth, please.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour sash is straight enough. What a particular little body you are!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt must be tied again. Please to tie it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, then. When I am gone you must get that young lady to dress you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn no account.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? She is a very nice young lady. I hope you mean to behave prettily to her,\r\nMissy, and not show your airs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe shall dress me on no account.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComical little thing!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not passing the comb straight through my hair, Harriet; the line will\r\nbe crooked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, you are ill to please. Does that suit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty well. Where should I go now that I am dressed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will take you into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey proceeded to the door. She stopped.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! Harriet, I wish this was papa\u2019s house! I don\u2019t know these people.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe a good child, Missy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am good, but I ache here;\u201d putting her hand to her heart, and moaning while\r\nshe reiterated, \u201cPapa! papa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI roused myself and started up, to check this scene while it was yet within\r\nbounds.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay good-morning to the young lady,\u201d dictated Harriet. She said,\r\n\u201cGood-morning,\u201d and then followed her nurse from the room. Harriet temporarily\r\nleft that same day, to go to her own friends, who lived in the neighbourhood.\r\n\n\r\nOn descending, I found Paulina (the child called herself Polly, but her full\r\nname was Paulina Mary) seated at the breakfast-table, by Mrs. Bretton\u2019s side; a\r\nmug of milk stood before her, a morsel of bread filled her hand, which lay\r\npassive on the table-cloth: she was not eating.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow we shall conciliate this little creature,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton to me, \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t know: she tastes nothing, and by her looks, she has not slept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI expressed my confidence in the effects of time and kindness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf she were to take a fancy to anybody in the house, she would soon settle;\r\nbut not till then,\u201d replied Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n"}
{"3": "\nCHAPTER II.\r\nPAULINA.\n\r\nSome days elapsed, and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy\r\nto anybody in the house. She was not exactly naughty or wilful: she was far\r\nfrom disobedient; but an object less conducive to comfort\u2014to tranquillity\r\neven\u2014than she presented, it was scarcely possible to have before one\u2019s eyes.\r\nShe moped: no grown person could have performed that uncheering business\r\nbetter; no furrowed face of adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe\u2019s\r\nantipodes, ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her\r\ninfant visage. She seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead\r\nguiltless of that curse, an overheated and discursive imagination; but\r\nwhenever, opening a room-door, I found her seated in a corner alone, her head\r\nin her pigmy hand, that room seemed to me not inhabited, but haunted.\r\n\n\r\nAnd again, when of moonlight nights, on waking, I beheld her figure, white and\r\nconspicuous in its night-dress, kneeling upright in bed, and praying like some\r\nCatholic or Methodist enthusiast\u2014some precocious fanatic or untimely saint\u2014I\r\nscarcely know what thoughts I had; but they ran risk of being hardly more\r\nrational and healthy than that child\u2019s mind must have been.\r\n\n\r\nI seldom caught a word of her prayers, for they were whispered low: sometimes,\r\nindeed, they were not whispered at all, but put up unuttered; such rare\r\nsentences as reached my ear still bore the burden, \u201cPapa; my dear papa!\u201d This,\r\nI perceived, was a one-idea\u2019d nature; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have\r\never thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed.\r\n\n\r\nWhat might have been the end of this fretting, had it continued unchecked, can\r\nonly be conjectured: it received, however, a sudden turn.\r\n\n\r\nOne afternoon, Mrs. Bretton, coaxing her from her usual station in a corner,\r\nhad lifted her into the window-seat, and, by way of occupying her attention,\r\ntold her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the\r\nstreet in a given time. She had sat listlessly, hardly looking, and not\r\ncounting, when\u2014my eye being fixed on hers\u2014I witnessed in its iris and pupil a\r\nstartling transfiguration. These sudden, dangerous natures\u2014sensitive as\r\nthey are called\u2014offer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler\r\ntemperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries. The fixed\r\nand heavy gaze swum, trembled, then glittered in fire; the small, overcast brow\r\ncleared; the trivial and dejected features lit up; the sad countenance\r\nvanished, and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness, an intense expectancy.\r\n\u201cIt is!\u201d were her words.\r\n\n\r\nLike a bird or a shaft, or any other swift thing, she was gone from the room.\r\nHow she got the house-door open I cannot tell; probably it might be ajar;\r\nperhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest, which would be impetuous\r\nenough. I\u2014watching calmly from the window\u2014saw her, in her black frock and tiny\r\nbraided apron (to pinafores she had an antipathy), dart half the length of the\r\nstreet; and, as I was on the point of turning, and quietly announcing to Mrs.\r\nBretton that the child was run out mad, and ought instantly to be pursued, I\r\nsaw her caught up, and rapt at once from my cool observation, and from the\r\nwondering stare of the passengers. A gentleman had done this good turn, and\r\nnow, covering her with his cloak, advanced to restore her to the house whence\r\nhe had seen her issue.\r\n\n\r\nI concluded he would leave her in a servant\u2019s charge and withdraw; but he\r\nentered: having tarried a little while below, he came up-stairs.\r\n\n\r\nHis reception immediately explained that he was known to Mrs. Bretton. She\r\nrecognised him; she greeted him, and yet she was fluttered, surprised, taken\r\nunawares. Her look and manner were even expostulatory; and in reply to these,\r\nrather than her words, he said,\u2014\u201cI could not help it, madam: I found it\r\nimpossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she\r\nsettled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will unsettle her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope not. And how is papa\u2019s little Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis question he addressed to Paulina, as he sat down and placed her gently on\r\nthe ground before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is Polly\u2019s papa?\u201d was the reply, as she leaned on his knee, and gazed up\r\ninto his face.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not a noisy, not a wordy scene: for that I was thankful; but it was a\r\nscene of feeling too brimful, and which, because the cup did not foam up high\r\nor furiously overflow, only oppressed one the more. On all occasions of\r\nvehement, unrestrained expansion, a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the\r\nweary spectator\u2019s relief; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of\r\nsensibility which bends of its own will, a giant slave under the sway of good\r\nsense.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home was a stern-featured\u2014perhaps I should rather say, a hard-featured man:\r\nhis forehead was knotty, and his cheekbones were marked and prominent. The\r\ncharacter of his face was quite Scotch; but there was feeling in his eye, and\r\nemotion in his now agitated countenance. His northern accent in speaking\r\nharmonised with his physiognomy. He was at once proud-looking and\r\nhomely-looking. He laid his hand on the child\u2019s uplifted head. She said\u2014\u201cKiss\r\nPolly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe kissed her. I wished she would utter some hysterical cry, so that I might\r\nget relief and be at ease. She made wonderfully little noise: she seemed to\r\nhave got what she wanted\u2014all she wanted, and to be in a trance of\r\ncontent. Neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire, and\r\nyet she was of his strain: her mind had been filled from his, as the cup from\r\nthe flagon.\r\n\n\r\nIndisputably, Mr. Home owned manly self-control, however he might secretly feel\r\non some matters. \u201cPolly,\u201d he said, looking down on his little girl, \u201cgo into\r\nthe hall; you will see papa\u2019s great-coat lying on a chair; put your hand into\r\nthe pockets, you will find a pocket-handkerchief there; bring it to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe obeyed; went and returned deftly and nimbly. He was talking to Mrs. Bretton\r\nwhen she came back, and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand. It was a\r\npicture, in its way, to see her, with her tiny stature, and trim, neat shape,\r\nstanding at his knee. Seeing that he continued to talk, apparently unconscious\r\nof her return, she took his hand, opened the unresisting fingers, insinuated\r\ninto them the handkerchief, and closed them upon it one by one. He still seemed\r\nnot to see or to feel her; but by-and-by, he lifted her to his knee; she\r\nnestled against him, and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an\r\nhour following, I suppose both were satisfied.\r\n\n\r\nDuring tea, the minute thing\u2019s movements and behaviour gave, as usual, full\r\noccupation to the eye. First she directed Warren, as he placed the chairs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut papa\u2019s chair here, and mine near it, between papa and Mrs. Bretton:\r\nI must hand his tea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe took her own seat, and beckoned with her hand to her father.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe near me, as if we were at home, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd again, as she intercepted his cup in passing, and would stir the sugar, and\r\nput in the cream herself, \u201cI always did it for you at home; papa: nobody could\r\ndo it as well, not even your own self.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the meal she continued her attentions: rather absurd they were. The\r\nsugar-tongs were too wide for one of her hands, and she had to use both in\r\nwielding them; the weight of the silver cream-ewer, the bread-and-butter\r\nplates, the very cup and saucer, tasked her insufficient strength and\r\ndexterity; but she would lift this, hand that, and luckily contrived through it\r\nall to break nothing. Candidly speaking, I thought her a little busy-body; but\r\nher father, blind like other parents, seemed perfectly content to let her wait\r\non him, and even wonderfully soothed by her offices.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is my comfort!\u201d he could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton. That lady had\r\nher own \u201ccomfort\u201d and nonpareil on a much larger scale, and, for the moment,\r\nabsent; so she sympathised with his foible.\r\n\n\r\nThis second \u201ccomfort\u201d came on the stage in the course of the evening. I knew\r\nthis day had been fixed for his return, and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had\r\nbeen expecting him through all its hours. We were seated round the fire, after\r\ntea, when Graham joined our circle: I should rather say, broke it up\u2014for, of\r\ncourse, his arrival made a bustle; and then, as Mr. Graham was fasting, there\r\nwas refreshment to be provided. He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance; of the\r\nlittle girl he took no notice for a time.\r\n\n\r\nHis meal over, and numerous questions from his mother answered, he turned from\r\nthe table to the hearth. Opposite where he had placed himself was seated Mr.\r\nHome, and at his elbow, the child. When I say child I use an\r\ninappropriate and undescriptive term\u2014a term suggesting any picture rather than\r\nthat of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette, that\r\nmight just have fitted a good-sized doll\u2014perched now on a high chair beside a\r\nstand, whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood, and holding in her\r\nhands a shred of a handkerchief, which she was professing to hem, and at which\r\nshe bored perseveringly with a needle, that in her fingers seemed almost a\r\nskewer, pricking herself ever and anon, marking the cambric with a track of\r\nminute red dots; occasionally starting when the perverse weapon\u2014swerving from\r\nher control\u2014inflicted a deeper stab than usual; but still silent, diligent,\r\nabsorbed, womanly.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was at that time a handsome, faithless-looking youth of sixteen. I say\r\nfaithless-looking, not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition,\r\nbut because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair, Celtic (not\r\nSaxon) character of his good looks; his waved light auburn hair, his supple\r\nsymmetry, his smile frequent, and destitute neither of fascination nor of\r\nsubtlety (in no bad sense). A spoiled, whimsical boy he was in those days.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d he said, after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for\r\nsome time, and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room relieved\r\nhim from the half-laughing bashfulness, which was all he knew of\r\ntimidity\u2014-\u201cMother, I see a young lady in the present society to whom I have not\r\nbeen introduced.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Home\u2019s little girl, I suppose you mean,\u201d said his mother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied her son, \u201cI consider your expression of the least\r\nceremonious: Miss Home I should certainly have said, in venturing to\r\nspeak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Graham, I will not have that child teased. Don\u2019t flatter yourself that I\r\nshall suffer you to make her your butt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Home,\u201d pursued Graham, undeterred by his mother\u2019s remonstrance, \u201cmight I\r\nhave the honour to introduce myself, since no one else seems willing to render\r\nyou and me that service? Your slave, John Graham Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked at him; he rose and bowed quite gravely. She deliberately put down\r\nthimble, scissors, work; descended with precaution from her perch, and\r\ncurtsying with unspeakable seriousness, said, \u201cHow do you do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have the honour to be in fair health, only in some measure fatigued with a\r\nhurried journey. I hope, ma\u2019am, I see you well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTor-rer-ably well,\u201d was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now\r\nessayed to regain her former elevation, but finding this could not be done\r\nwithout some climbing and straining\u2014a sacrifice of decorum not to be thought\r\nof\u2014and being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young\r\ngentleman, she relinquished the high chair for a low stool: towards that low\r\nstool Graham drew in his chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope, ma\u2019am, the present residence, my mother\u2019s house, appears to you a\r\nconvenient place of abode?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot par-tic-er-er-ly; I want to go home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA natural and laudable desire, ma\u2019am; but one which, notwithstanding, I shall\r\ndo my best to oppose. I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that\r\nprecious commodity called amusement, which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail\r\nto yield me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall have to go with papa soon: I shall not stay long at your mother\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes; you will stay with me, I am sure. I have a pony on which you shall\r\nride, and no end of books with pictures to show you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to live here now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am. Does that please you? Do you like me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think you queer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy face, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour face and all about you: You have long red hair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAuburn hair, if you please: mamma calls it auburn, or golden, and so do all\r\nher friends. But even with my \u2018long red hair\u2019\u201d (and he waved his mane with a\r\nsort of triumph\u2014tawny he himself well knew that it was, and he was proud of the\r\nleonine hue), \u201cI cannot possibly be queerer than is your ladyship.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou call me queer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cI think I shall go to bed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since; but you\r\nprobably sat up in the expectation of seeing me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society. You knew I was\r\ncoming home, and would wait to have a look at me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI sat up for papa, and not for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Miss Home. I am going to be a favourite: preferred before papa\r\nsoon, I daresay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night; she seemed hesitating whether\r\nGraham\u2019s deserts entitled him to the same attention, when he caught her up with\r\none hand, and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head. She saw\r\nherself thus lifted up on high, in the glass over the fireplace. The\r\nsuddenness, the freedom, the disrespect of the action were too much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor shame, Mr. Graham!\u201d was her indignant cry, \u201cput me down!\u201d\u2014and when again\r\non her feet, \u201cI wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in\r\nthat way, lifting you with my hand\u201c (raising that mighty member) \u201cas Warren\r\nlifts the little cat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo saying, she departed.\r\n\n"}
{"4": "\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE PLAYMATES.\n\r\nMr. Home stayed two days. During his visit he could not be prevailed on to go\r\nout: he sat all day long by the fireside, sometimes silent, sometimes receiving\r\nand answering Mrs. Bretton\u2019s chat, which was just of the proper sort for a man\r\nin his morbid mood\u2014not over-sympathetic, yet not too uncongenial, sensible; and\r\neven with a touch of the motherly\u2014she was sufficiently his senior to be\r\npermitted this touch.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Paulina, the child was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful. Her\r\nfather frequently lifted her to his knee; she would sit there till she felt or\r\nfancied he grew restless; then it was\u2014\u201cPapa, put me down; I shall tire you with\r\nmy weight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the mighty burden slid to the rug, and establishing itself on carpet or\r\nstool just at \u201cpapa\u2019s\u201c feet, the white work-box and the scarlet-speckled\r\nhandkerchief came into play. This handkerchief, it seems, was intended as a\r\nkeepsake for \u201cpapa,\u201d and must be finished before his departure; consequently\r\nthe demand on the sempstress\u2019s industry (she accomplished about a score of\r\nstitches in half-an-hour) was stringent.\r\n\n\r\nThe evening, by restoring Graham to the maternal roof (his days were passed at\r\nschool), brought us an accession of animation\u2014a quality not diminished by the\r\nnature of the scenes pretty sure to be enacted between him and Miss Paulina.\r\n\n\r\nA distant and haughty demeanour had been the result of the indignity put upon\r\nher the first evening of his arrival: her usual answer, when he addressed her,\r\nwas\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t attend to you; I have other things to think about.\u201d Being implored\r\nto state what things:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBusiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham would endeavour to seduce her attention by opening his desk and\r\ndisplaying its multifarious contents: seals, bright sticks of wax, pen-knives,\r\nwith a miscellany of engravings\u2014some of them gaily coloured\u2014which he had\r\namassed from time to time. Nor was this powerful temptation wholly unavailing:\r\nher eyes, furtively raised from her work, cast many a peep towards the\r\nwriting-table, rich in scattered pictures. An etching of a child playing with a\r\nBlenheim spaniel happened to flutter to the floor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty little dog!\u201d said she, delighted.\r\n\n\r\nGraham prudently took no notice. Ere long, stealing from her corner, she\r\napproached to examine the treasure more closely. The dog\u2019s great eyes and long\r\nears, and the child\u2019s hat and feathers, were irresistible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNice picture!\u201d was her favourable criticism.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014you may have it,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nShe seemed to hesitate. The wish to possess was strong, but to accept would be\r\na compromise of dignity. No. She put it down and turned away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have it, then, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather not, thank you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell you what I will do with the picture if you refuse it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe half turned to listen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCut it into strips for lighting the taper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I shall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham waxed inexorable on hearing the pleading tone; he took the scissors from\r\nhis mother\u2019s work-basket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere goes!\u201d said he, making a menacing flourish. \u201cRight through Fido\u2019s head,\r\nand splitting little Harry\u2019s nose.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen come to me. Come quickly, or it is done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe hesitated, lingered, but complied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, will you have it?\u201d he asked, as she stood before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I shall want payment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA kiss.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive the picture first into my hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPolly, as she said this, looked rather faithless in her turn. Graham gave it.\r\nShe absconded a debtor, darted to her father, and took refuge on his knee.\r\nGraham rose in mimic wrath and followed. She buried her face in Mr. Home\u2019s\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa\u2014papa\u2014send him away!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll not be sent away,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nWith face still averted, she held out her hand to keep him off.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, I shall kiss the hand,\u201d said he; but that moment it became a miniature\r\nfist, and dealt him payment in a small coin that was not kisses.\r\n\n\r\nGraham\u2014not failing in his way to be as wily as his little playmate\u2014retreated\r\napparently quite discomfited; he flung himself on a sofa, and resting his head\r\nagainst the cushion, lay like one in pain. Polly, finding him silent, presently\r\npeeped at him. His eyes and face were covered with his hands. She turned on her\r\nfather\u2019s knee, and gazed at her foe anxiously and long. Graham groaned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, what is the matter?\u201d she whispered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had better ask him, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d (groan second.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe makes a noise as if he were,\u201d said Mr. Home.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d suggested Graham, feebly, \u201cI think you had better send for the\r\ndoctor. Oh my eye!\u201d (renewed silence, broken only by sighs from Graham.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to become blind\u2014\u2014?\u201d suggested this last.\r\n\n\r\nHis chastiser could not bear the suggestion. She was beside him directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me see your eye: I did not mean to touch it, only your mouth; and I did\r\nnot think I hit so very hard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSilence answered her. Her features worked,\u2014\u201cI am sorry; I am sorry!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen succeeded emotion, faltering; weeping.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave done trying that child, Graham,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is all nonsense, my pet,\u201d cried Mr. Home.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Graham once more snatched her aloft, and she again punished him; and while\r\nshe pulled his lion\u2019s locks, termed him\u2014\u201cThe naughtiest, rudest, worst,\r\nuntruest person that ever was.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn the morning of Mr. Home\u2019s departure, he and his daughter had some\r\nconversation in a window-recess by themselves; I heard part of it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t I pack my box and go with you, papa?\u201d she whispered earnestly.\r\n\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShould I be a trouble to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I am little?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are little and tender. It is only great, strong people that should\r\ntravel. But don\u2019t look sad, my little girl; it breaks my heart. Papa, will soon\r\ncome back to his Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed, I am not sad, scarcely at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly would be sorry to give papa pain; would she not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSorrier than sorry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen Polly must be cheerful: not cry at parting; not fret afterwards. She must\r\nlook forward to meeting again, and try to be happy meanwhile. Can she do this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will try.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see she will. Farewell, then. It is time to go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow?\u2014just now?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe held up quivering lips. Her father sobbed, but she, I remarked, did not.\r\nHaving put her down, he shook hands with the rest present, and departed.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the street-door closed, she dropped on her knees at a chair with a\r\ncry\u2014\u201cPapa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was low and long; a sort of \u201cWhy hast thou forsaken me?\u201d During an ensuing\r\nspace of some minutes, I perceived she endured agony. She went through, in that\r\nbrief interval of her infant life, emotions such as some never feel; it was in\r\nher constitution: she would have more of such instants if she lived. Nobody\r\nspoke. Mrs. Bretton, being a mother, shed a tear or two. Graham, who was\r\nwriting, lifted up his eyes and gazed at her. I, Lucy Snowe, was calm.\r\n\n\r\nThe little creature, thus left unharassed, did for herself what none other\r\ncould do\u2014contended with an intolerable feeling; and, ere long, in some degree,\r\nrepressed it. That day she would accept solace from none; nor the next day: she\r\ngrew more passive afterwards.\r\n\n\r\nOn the third evening, as she sat on the floor, worn and quiet, Graham, coming\r\nin, took her up gently, without a word. She did not resist: she rather nestled\r\nin his arms, as if weary. When he sat down, she laid her head against him; in a\r\nfew minutes she slept; he carried her upstairs to bed. I was not surprised\r\nthat, the next morning, the first thing she demanded was, \u201cWhere is Mr.\r\nGraham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt happened that Graham was not coming to the breakfast-table; he had some\r\nexercises to write for that morning\u2019s class, and had requested his mother to\r\nsend a cup of tea into the study. Polly volunteered to carry it: she must be\r\nbusy about something, look after somebody. The cup was entrusted to her; for,\r\nif restless, she was also careful. As the study was opposite the\r\nbreakfast-room, the doors facing across the passage, my eye followed her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, pausing on the threshold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWriting,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to take breakfast with your mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cToo busy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you want any breakfast?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she deposited the cup on the carpet, like a jailor putting a prisoner\u2019s\r\npitcher of water through his cell-door, and retreated. Presently she returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you have besides tea\u2014what to eat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnything good. Bring me something particularly nice; that\u2019s a kind little\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe came back to Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, send your boy something good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall choose for him, Polly; what shall my boy have?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe selected a portion of whatever was best on the table; and, ere long, came\r\nback with a whispered request for some marmalade, which was not there. Having\r\ngot it, however, (for Mrs. Bretton refused the pair nothing), Graham was\r\nshortly after heard lauding her to the skies; promising that, when he had a\r\nhouse of his own, she should be his housekeeper, and perhaps\u2014if she showed any\r\nculinary genius\u2014his cook; and, as she did not return, and I went to look after\r\nher, I found Graham and her breakfasting t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\u2014she standing at his\r\nelbow, and sharing his fare: excepting the marmalade, which she delicately\r\nrefused to touch, lest, I suppose, it should appear that she had procured it as\r\nmuch on her own account as his. She constantly evinced these nice perceptions\r\nand delicate instincts.\r\n\n\r\nThe league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was not hastily dissolved; on the\r\ncontrary, it appeared that time and circumstances served rather to cement than\r\nloosen it. Ill-assimilated as the two were in age, sex, pursuits, &c., they\r\nsomehow found a great deal to say to each other. As to Paulina, I observed that\r\nher little character never properly came out, except with young Bretton. As she\r\ngot settled, and accustomed to the house, she proved tractable enough with Mrs.\r\nBretton; but she would sit on a stool at that lady\u2019s feet all day long,\r\nlearning her task, or sewing, or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate, and\r\nnever kindling once to originality, or showing a single gleam of the\r\npeculiarities of her nature. I ceased to watch her under such circumstances:\r\nshe was not interesting. But the moment Graham\u2019s knock sounded of an evening, a\r\nchange occurred; she was instantly at the head of the staircase. Usually her\r\nwelcome was a reprimand or a threat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have not wiped your shoes properly on the mat. I shall tell your mamma.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle busybody! Are you there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014and you can\u2019t reach me: I am higher up than you\u201c (peeping between the\r\nrails of the banister; she could not look over them).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear boy!\u201d (such was one of her terms for him, adopted in imitation of his\r\nmother.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am fit to faint with fatigue,\u201d declared Graham, leaning against the\r\npassage-wall in seeming exhaustion. \u201cDr. Digby\u201c (the headmaster) \u201chas quite\r\nknocked me up with overwork. Just come down and help me to carry up my books.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you\u2019re cunning!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, Polly\u2014it is positive fact. I\u2019m as weak as a rush. Come down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour eyes are quiet like the cat\u2019s, but you\u2019ll spring.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpring? Nothing of the kind: it isn\u2019t in me. Come down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I may\u2014if you\u2019ll promise not to touch\u2014not to snatch me up, and not to\r\nwhirl me round.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI? I couldn\u2019t do it!\u201d (sinking into a chair.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen put the books down on the first step, and go three yards off.\u201c\r\n\n\r\nThis being done, she descended warily, and not taking her eyes from the feeble\r\nGraham. Of course her approach always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life:\r\nthe game of romps was sure to be exacted. Sometimes she would be angry;\r\nsometimes the matter was allowed to pass smoothly, and we could hear her say as\r\nshe led him up-stairs: \u201cNow, my dear boy, come and take your tea\u2014I am sure you\r\nmust want something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was sufficiently comical to observe her as she sat beside Graham, while he\r\ntook that meal. In his absence she was a still personage, but with him the most\r\nofficious, fidgety little body possible. I often wished she would mind herself\r\nand be tranquil; but no\u2014herself was forgotten in him: he could not be\r\nsufficiently well waited on, nor carefully enough looked after; he was more\r\nthan the Grand Turk in her estimation. She would gradually assemble the various\r\nplates before him, and, when one would suppose all he could possibly desire was\r\nwithin his reach, she would find out something else: \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d she would whisper\r\nto Mrs. Bretton,\u2014\u201cperhaps your son would like a little cake\u2014sweet cake, you\r\nknow\u2014there is some in there\u201c (pointing to the sideboard cupboard). Mrs.\r\nBretton, as a rule, disapproved of sweet cake at tea, but still the request was\r\nurged,\u2014\u201cOne little piece\u2014only for him\u2014as he goes to school: girls\u2014such as me\r\nand Miss Snowe\u2014don\u2019t need treats, but he would like it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham did like it very well, and almost always got it. To do him justice, he\r\nwould have shared his prize with her to whom he owed it; but that was never\r\nallowed: to insist, was to ruffle her for the evening. To stand by his knee,\r\nand monopolize his talk and notice, was the reward she wanted\u2014not a share of\r\nthe cake.\r\n\n\r\nWith curious readiness did she adapt herself to such themes as interested him.\r\nOne would have thought the child had no mind or life of her own, but must\r\nnecessarily live, move, and have her being in another: now that her father was\r\ntaken from her, she nestled to Graham, and seemed to feel by his feelings: to\r\nexist in his existence. She learned the names of all his schoolfellows in a\r\ntrice: she got by heart their characters as given from his lips: a single\r\ndescription of an individual seemed to suffice. She never forgot, or confused\r\nidentities: she would talk with him the whole evening about people she had\r\nnever seen, and appear completely to realise their aspect, manners, and\r\ndispositions. Some she learned to mimic: an under-master, who was an aversion\r\nof young Bretton\u2019s, had, it seems, some peculiarities, which she caught up in a\r\nmoment from Graham\u2019s representation, and rehearsed for his amusement; this,\r\nhowever, Mrs. Bretton disapproved and forbade.\r\n\n\r\nThe pair seldom quarrelled; yet once a rupture occurred, in which her feelings\r\nreceived a severe shock.\r\n\n\r\nOne day Graham, on the occasion of his birthday, had some friends\u2014lads of his\r\nown age\u2014to dine with him. Paulina took much interest in the coming of these\r\nfriends; she had frequently heard of them; they were amongst those of whom\r\nGraham oftenest spoke. After dinner, the young gentlemen were left by\r\nthemselves in the dining-room, where they soon became very merry and made a\r\ngood deal of noise. Chancing to pass through the hall, I found Paulina sitting\r\nalone on the lowest step of the staircase, her eyes fixed on the glossy panels\r\nof the dining-room door, where the reflection of the hall-lamp was shining; her\r\nlittle brow knit in anxious meditation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular; only I wish that door was clear glass\u2014that I might see\r\nthrough it. The boys seem very cheerful, and I want to go to them: I want to be\r\nwith Graham, and watch his friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat hinders you from going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI feel afraid: but may I try, do you think? May I knock at the door, and ask\r\nto be let in?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought perhaps they might not object to have her as a playmate, and\r\ntherefore encouraged the attempt.\r\n\n\r\nShe knocked\u2014too faintly at first to be heard, but on a second essay the door\r\nunclosed; Graham\u2019s head appeared; he looked in high spirits, but impatient.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, you little monkey?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo come to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you indeed? As if I would be troubled with you! Away to mamma and Mistress\r\nSnowe, and tell them to put you to bed.\u201d The auburn head and bright flushed\r\nface vanished,\u2014the door shut peremptorily. She was stunned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy does he speak so? He never spoke so before,\u201d she said in consternation.\r\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, Polly; but Graham is busy with his school-friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he likes them better than me! He turns me away now they are here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had some thoughts of consoling her, and of improving the occasion by\r\ninculcating some of those maxims of philosophy whereof I had ever a tolerable\r\nstock ready for application. She stopped me, however, by putting her fingers in\r\nher ears at the first words I uttered, and then lying down on the mat with her\r\nface against the flags; nor could either Warren or the cook root her from that\r\nposition: she was allowed to lie, therefore, till she chose to rise of her own\r\naccord.\r\n\n\r\nGraham forgot his impatience the same evening, and would have accosted her as\r\nusual when his friends were gone, but she wrenched herself from his hand; her\r\neye quite flashed; she would not bid him good-night; she would not look in his\r\nface. The next day he treated her with indifference, and she grew like a bit of\r\nmarble. The day after, he teased her to know what was the matter; her lips\r\nwould not unclose. Of course he could not feel real anger on his side: the\r\nmatch was too unequal in every way; he tried soothing and coaxing. \u201cWhy was she\r\nso angry? What had he done?\u201d By-and-by tears answered him; he petted her, and\r\nthey were friends. But she was one on whom such incidents were not lost: I\r\nremarked that never after this rebuff did she seek him, or follow him, or in\r\nany way solicit his notice. I told her once to carry a book or some other\r\narticle to Graham when he was shut up in his study.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall wait till he comes out,\u201d said she, proudly; \u201cI don\u2019t choose to give\r\nhim the trouble of rising to open the door.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYoung Bretton had a favourite pony on which he often rode out; from the window\r\nshe always watched his departure and return. It was her ambition to be\r\npermitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony; but far be it from\r\nher to ask such a favour. One day she descended to the yard to watch him\r\ndismount; as she leaned against the gate, the longing wish for the indulgence\r\nof a ride glittered in her eye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Polly, will you have a canter?\u201d asked Graham, half carelessly.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose she thought he was too careless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said she, turning away with the utmost coolness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d pursued he. \u201cYou will like it, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I should care a fig about it,\u201d was the response.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is not true. You told Lucy Snowe you longed to have a ride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe is a tatter-box,\u201d I heard her say (her imperfect\r\narticulation was the least precocious thing she had about her); and with this;\r\nshe walked into the house.\r\n\n\r\nGraham, coming in soon after, observed to his mother,\u2014\u201cMamma, I believe that\r\ncreature is a changeling: she is a perfect cabinet of oddities; but I should be\r\ndull without her: she amuses me a great deal more than you or Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said Paulina to me (she had now got into the habit of\r\noccasionally chatting with me when we were alone in our room at night), \u201cdo you\r\nknow on what day in the week I like Graham best?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can I possibly know anything so strange? Is there one day out of the seven\r\nwhen he is otherwise than on the other six?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure! Can\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you know? I find him the most excellent on a\r\nSunday; then we have him the whole day, and he is quiet, and, in the evening,\r\nso kind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis observation was not altogether groundless: going to church, &c., kept\r\nGraham quiet on the Sunday, and the evening he generally dedicated to a serene,\r\nthough rather indolent sort of enjoyment by the parlour fireside. He would take\r\npossession of the couch, and then he would call Polly.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was a boy not quite as other boys are; all his delight did not lie in\r\naction: he was capable of some intervals of contemplation; he could take a\r\npleasure too in reading, nor was his selection of books wholly indiscriminate:\r\nthere were glimmerings of characteristic preference, and even of instinctive\r\ntaste in the choice. He rarely, it is true, remarked on what he read, but I\r\nhave seen him sit and think of it.\r\n\n\r\nPolly, being near him, kneeling on a little cushion or the carpet, a\r\nconversation would begin in murmurs, not inaudible, though subdued. I caught a\r\nsnatch of their tenor now and then; and, in truth, some influence better and\r\nfiner than that of every day, seemed to soothe Graham at such times into no\r\nungentle mood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you learned any hymns this week, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have learned a very pretty one, four verses long. Shall I say it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak nicely, then: don\u2019t be in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe hymn being rehearsed, or rather half-chanted, in a little singing voice,\r\nGraham would take exceptions at the manner, and proceed to give a lesson in\r\nrecitation. She was quick in learning, apt in imitating; and, besides, her\r\npleasure was to please Graham: she proved a ready scholar. To the hymn would\r\nsucceed some reading\u2014perhaps a chapter in the Bible; correction was seldom\r\nrequired here, for the child could read any simple narrative chapter very well;\r\nand, when the subject was such as she could understand and take an interest in,\r\nher expression and emphasis were something remarkable. Joseph cast into the\r\npit; the calling of Samuel; Daniel in the lions\u2019 den;\u2014these were favourite\r\npassages: of the first especially she seemed perfectly to feel the pathos.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor Jacob!\u201d she would sometimes say, with quivering lips. \u201cHow he loved his\r\nson Joseph! As much,\u201d she once added\u2014\u201cas much, Graham, as I love you: if you\r\nwere to die\u201c (and she re-opened the book, sought the verse, and read), \u201cI\r\nshould refuse to be comforted, and go down into the grave to you mourning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith these words she gathered Graham in her little arms, drawing his\r\nlong-tressed head towards her. The action, I remember, struck me as strangely\r\nrash; exciting the feeling one might experience on seeing an animal dangerous\r\nby nature, and but half-tamed by art, too heedlessly fondled. Not that I feared\r\nGraham would hurt, or very roughly check her; but I thought she ran risk of\r\nincurring such a careless, impatient repulse, as would be worse almost to her\r\nthan a blow. On the whole, however, these demonstrations were borne passively:\r\nsometimes even a sort of complacent wonder at her earnest partiality would\r\nsmile not unkindly in his eyes. Once he said:\u2014\u201cYou like me almost as well as if\r\nyou were my little sister, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I do like you,\u201d said she; \u201cI do like you very much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was not long allowed the amusement of this study of character. She had\r\nscarcely been at Bretton two months, when a letter came from Mr. Home,\r\nsignifying that he was now settled amongst his maternal kinsfolk on the\r\nContinent; that, as England was become wholly distasteful to him, he had no\r\nthoughts of returning hither, perhaps, for years; and that he wished his little\r\ngirl to join him immediately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how she will take this news?\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, when she had read\r\nthe letter. I wondered, too, and I took upon myself to communicate it.\r\n\n\r\nRepairing to the drawing-room\u2014in which calm and decorated apartment she was\r\nfond of being alone, and where she could be implicitly trusted, for she\r\nfingered nothing, or rather soiled nothing she fingered\u2014I found her seated,\r\nlike a little Odalisque, on a couch, half shaded by the drooping draperies of\r\nthe window near. She seemed happy; all her appliances for occupation were about\r\nher; the white wood workbox, a shred or two of muslin, an end or two of ribbon\r\ncollected for conversion into doll-millinery. The doll, duly night-capped and\r\nnight-gowned, lay in its cradle; she was rocking it to sleep, with an air of\r\nthe most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and somnolent faculties;\r\nher eyes, at the same time, being engaged with a picture-book, which lay open\r\non her lap.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said she in a whisper, \u201cthis is a wonderful book. Candace\u201d (the\r\ndoll, christened by Graham; for, indeed, its begrimed complexion gave it much\r\nof an Ethiopian aspect)\u2014\u201cCandace is asleep now, and I may tell you about it;\r\nonly we must both speak low, lest she should waken. This book was given me by\r\nGraham; it tells about distant countries, a long, long way from England, which\r\nno traveller can reach without sailing thousands of miles over the sea. Wild\r\nmen live in these countries, Miss Snowe, who wear clothes different from ours:\r\nindeed, some of them wear scarcely any clothes, for the sake of being cool, you\r\nknow; for they have very hot weather. Here is a picture of thousands gathered\r\nin a desolate place\u2014a plain, spread with sand\u2014round a man in black,\u2014a good,\r\ngood Englishman\u2014a missionary, who is preaching to them under a\r\npalm-tree.\u201d (She showed a little coloured cut to that effect.) \u201cAnd here are\r\npictures\u201d (she went on) \u201cmore stranger\u201d (grammar was occasionally forgotten)\r\n\u201cthan that. There is the wonderful Great Wall of China; here is a Chinese lady,\r\nwith a foot littler than mine. There is a wild horse of Tartary; and here, most\r\nstrange of all\u2014is a land of ice and snow, without green fields, woods, or\r\ngardens. In this land, they found some mammoth bones: there are no mammoths\r\nnow. You don\u2019t know what it was; but I can tell you, because Graham told me. A\r\nmighty, goblin creature, as high as this room, and as long as the hall; but not\r\na fierce, flesh-eating thing, Graham thinks. He believes, if I met one in a\r\nforest, it would not kill me, unless I came quite in its way; when it would\r\ntrample me down amongst the bushes, as I might tread on a grasshopper in a\r\nhayfield without knowing it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus she rambled on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cshould you like to travel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot just yet,\u201d was the prudent answer; \u201cbut perhaps in twenty years, when I am\r\ngrown a woman, as tall as Mrs. Bretton, I may travel with Graham. We intend\r\ngoing to Switzerland, and climbing Mount Blanck; and some day we shall sail\r\nover to South America, and walk to the top of Kim-kim-borazo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how would you like to travel now, if your papa was with you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer reply\u2014not given till after a pause\u2014evinced one of those unexpected turns of\r\ntemper peculiar to her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the good of talking in that silly way?\u201d said she. \u201cWhy do you mention\r\npapa? What is papa to you? I was just beginning to be happy, and not think\r\nabout him so much; and there it will be all to do over again!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer lip trembled. I hastened to disclose the fact of a letter having been\r\nreceived, and to mention the directions given that she and Harriet should\r\nimmediately rejoin this dear papa. \u201cNow, Polly, are you not glad?\u201d I added.\r\n\n\r\nShe made no answer. She dropped her book and ceased to rock her doll; she gazed\r\nat me with gravity and earnestness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall not you like to go to papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said at last in that trenchant manner she usually employed in\r\nspeaking to me; and which was quite different from that she used with Mrs.\r\nBretton, and different again from the one dedicated to Graham. I wished to\r\nascertain more of what she thought but no: she would converse no more.\r\nHastening to Mrs. Bretton, she questioned her, and received the confirmation of\r\nmy news. The weight and importance of these tidings kept her perfectly serious\r\nthe whole day. In the evening, at the moment Graham\u2019s entrance was heard below,\r\nI found her at my side. She began to arrange a locket-ribbon about my neck, she\r\ndisplaced and replaced the comb in my hair; while thus busied, Graham entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him by-and-by,\u201d she whispered; \u201ctell him I am going.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of tea-time I made the desired communication. Graham, it chanced,\r\nwas at that time greatly preoccupied about some school-prize, for which he was\r\ncompeting. The news had to be told twice before it took proper hold of his\r\nattention, and even then he dwelt on it but momently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly going? What a pity! Dear little Mousie, I shall be sorry to lose her:\r\nshe must come to us again, mamma.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd hastily swallowing his tea, he took a candle and a small table to himself\r\nand his books, and was soon buried in study.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle Mousie\u201d crept to his side, and lay down on the carpet at his feet, her\r\nface to the floor; mute and motionless she kept that post and position till\r\nbed-time. Once I saw Graham\u2014wholly unconscious of her proximity\u2014push her with\r\nhis restless foot. She receded an inch or two. A minute after one little hand\r\nstole out from beneath her face, to which it had been pressed, and softly\r\ncaressed the heedless foot. When summoned by her nurse she rose and departed\r\nvery obediently, having bid us all a subdued good-night.\r\n\n\r\nI will not say that I dreaded going to bed, an hour later; yet I certainly went\r\nwith an unquiet anticipation that I should find that child in no peaceful\r\nsleep. The forewarning of my instinct was but fulfilled, when I discovered her,\r\nall cold and vigilant, perched like a white bird on the outside of the bed. I\r\nscarcely knew how to accost her; she was not to be managed like another child.\r\nShe, however, accosted me. As I closed the door, and put the light on the\r\ndressing-table, she turned to me with these words:\u2014\u201cI cannot\u2014cannot\r\nsleep; and in this way I cannot\u2014cannot live!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI asked what ailed her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDedful miz-er-y!\u201d said she, with her piteous lisp.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I call Mrs. Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is downright silly,\u201d was her impatient reply; and, indeed, I well knew\r\nthat if she had heard Mrs. Bretton\u2019s foot approach, she would have nestled\r\nquiet as a mouse under the bedclothes. Whilst lavishing her eccentricities\r\nregardlessly before me\u2014for whom she professed scarcely the semblance of\r\naffection\u2014she never showed my godmother one glimpse of her inner self: for her,\r\nshe was nothing but a docile, somewhat quaint little maiden. I examined her;\r\nher cheek was crimson; her dilated eye was both troubled and glowing, and\r\npainfully restless: in this state it was obvious she must not be left till\r\nmorning. I guessed how the case stood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to bid Graham good-night again?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is not gone to\r\nhis room yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe at once stretched out her little arms to be lifted. Folding a shawl round\r\nher, I carried her back to the drawing-room. Graham was just coming out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe cannot sleep without seeing and speaking to you once more,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\r\ndoes not like the thought of leaving you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoilt her,\u201d said he, taking her from me with good humour, and kissing\r\nher little hot face and burning lips. \u201cPolly, you care for me more than for\r\npapa, now\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do care for you, but you care nothing for me,\u201d was her whisper.\r\n\n\r\nShe was assured to the contrary, again kissed, restored to me, and I carried\r\nher away; but, alas! not soothed.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I thought she could listen to me, I said\u2014\u201cPaulina, you should not grieve\r\nthat Graham does not care for you so much as you care for him. It must be so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer lifted and questioning eyes asked why.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is a boy and you are a girl; he is sixteen and you are only six;\r\nhis nature is strong and gay, and yours is otherwise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I love him so much; he should love me a little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe does. He is fond of you. You are his favourite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I Graham\u2019s favourite?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, more than any little child I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe assurance soothed her; she smiled in her anguish.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I continued, \u201cdon\u2019t fret, and don\u2019t expect too much of him, or else he\r\nwill feel you to be troublesome, and then it is all over.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll over!\u201d she echoed softly; \u201cthen I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll try to be good, Lucy\r\nSnowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI put her to bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he forgive me this one time?\u201d she asked, as I undressed myself. I assured\r\nher that he would; that as yet he was by no means alienated; that she had only\r\nto be careful for the future.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no future,\u201d said she: \u201cI am going. Shall I ever\u2014ever\u2014see him again,\r\nafter I leave England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI returned an encouraging response. The candle being extinguished, a still\r\nhalf-hour elapsed. I thought her asleep, when the little white shape once more\r\nlifted itself in the crib, and the small voice asked\u2014\u201cDo you like Graham, Miss\r\nSnowe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLike him! Yes, a little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly a little! Do you like him as I do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not. No: not as you do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like him much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI told you I liked him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very\r\nmuch: he is full of faults.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll boys are.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMore than girls?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anybody perfect; and as to\r\nlikes and dislikes, we should be friendly to all, and worship none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you a wise person?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean to try to be so. Go to sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot go to sleep. Have you no pain just here\u201d (laying her elfish\r\nhand on her elfish breast,) \u201cwhen you think you shall have to leave\r\nGraham; for your home is not here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely, Polly,\u201d said I, \u201cyou should not feel so much pain when you are very\r\nsoon going to rejoin your father. Have you forgotten him? Do you no longer wish\r\nto be his little companion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDead silence succeeded this question.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChild, lie down and sleep,\u201d I urged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy bed is cold,\u201d said she. \u201cI can\u2019t warm it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI saw the little thing shiver. \u201cCome to me,\u201d I said, wishing, yet scarcely\r\nhoping, that she would comply: for she was a most strange, capricious, little\r\ncreature, and especially whimsical with me. She came, however, instantly, like\r\na small ghost gliding over the carpet. I took her in. She was chill: I warmed\r\nher in my arms. She trembled nervously; I soothed her. Thus tranquillized and\r\ncherished she at last slumbered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA very unique child,\u201d thought I, as I viewed her sleeping countenance by the\r\nfitful moonlight, and cautiously and softly wiped her glittering eyelids and\r\nher wet cheeks with my handkerchief. \u201cHow will she get through this world, or\r\nbattle with this life? How will she bear the shocks and repulses, the\r\nhumiliations and desolations, which books, and my own reason, tell me are\r\nprepared for all flesh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe departed the next day; trembling like a leaf when she took leave, but\r\nexercising self-command.\r\n\n"}
{"5": "\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nMISS MARCHMONT.\n\r\nOn quitting Bretton, which I did a few weeks after Paulina\u2019s departure\u2014little\r\nthinking then I was never again to visit it; never more to tread its calm old\r\nstreets\u2014I betook myself home, having been absent six months. It will be\r\nconjectured that I was of course glad to return to the bosom of my kindred.\r\nWell! the amiable conjecture does no harm, and may therefore be safely left\r\nuncontradicted. Far from saying nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to\r\npicture me, for the next eight years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon\r\nweather, in a harbour still as glass\u2014the steersman stretched on the little\r\ndeck, his face up to heaven, his eyes closed: buried, if you will, in a long\r\nprayer. A great many women and girls are supposed to pass their lives something\r\nin that fashion; why not I with the rest?\r\n\n\r\nPicture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy, stretched on a cushioned deck,\r\nwarmed with constant sunshine, rocked by breezes indolently soft. However, it\r\ncannot be concealed that, in that case, I must somehow have fallen overboard,\r\nor that there must have been wreck at last. I too well remember a time\u2014a long\r\ntime\u2014of cold, of danger, of contention. To this hour, when I have the\r\nnightmare, it repeats the rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat, and\r\ntheir icy pressure on my lungs. I even know there was a storm, and that not of\r\none hour nor one day. For many days and nights neither sun nor stars appeared;\r\nwe cast with our own hands the tackling out of the ship; a heavy tempest lay on\r\nus; all hope that we should be saved was taken away. In fine, the ship was\r\nlost, the crew perished.\r\n\n\r\nAs far as I recollect, I complained to no one about these troubles. Indeed, to\r\nwhom could I complain? Of Mrs. Bretton I had long lost sight. Impediments,\r\nraised by others, had, years ago, come in the way of our intercourse, and cut\r\nit off. Besides, time had brought changes for her, too: the handsome property\r\nof which she was left guardian for her son, and which had been chiefly invested\r\nin some joint-stock undertaking, had melted, it was said, to a fraction of its\r\noriginal amount. Graham, I learned from incidental rumours, had adopted a\r\nprofession; both he and his mother were gone from Bretton, and were understood\r\nto be now in London. Thus, there remained no possibility of dependence on\r\nothers; to myself alone could I look. I know not that I was of a self-reliant\r\nor active nature; but self-reliance and exertion were forced upon me by\r\ncircumstances, as they are upon thousands besides; and when Miss Marchmont, a\r\nmaiden lady of our neighbourhood, sent for me, I obeyed her behest, in the hope\r\nthat she might assign me some task I could undertake.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Marchmont was a woman of fortune, and lived in a handsome residence; but\r\nshe was a rheumatic cripple, impotent, foot and hand, and had been so for\r\ntwenty years. She always sat upstairs: her drawing-room adjoined her bed-room.\r\nI had often heard of Miss Marchmont, and of her peculiarities (she had the\r\ncharacter of being very eccentric), but till now had never seen her. I found\r\nher a furrowed, grey-haired woman, grave with solitude, stern with long\r\naffliction, irritable also, and perhaps exacting. It seemed that a maid, or\r\nrather companion, who had waited on her for some years, was about to be\r\nmarried; and she, hearing of my bereaved lot, had sent for me, with the idea\r\nthat I might supply this person\u2019s place. She made the proposal to me after tea,\r\nas she and I sat alone by her fireside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will not be an easy life;\u201d said she candidly, \u201cfor I require a good deal of\r\nattention, and you will be much confined; yet, perhaps, contrasted with the\r\nexistence you have lately led, it may appear tolerable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected. Of course it ought to appear tolerable, I argued inwardly; but\r\nsomehow, by some strange fatality, it would not. To live here, in this close\r\nroom, the watcher of suffering\u2014sometimes, perhaps, the butt of temper\u2014through\r\nall that was to come of my youth; while all that was gone had passed, to say\r\nthe least, not blissfully! My heart sunk one moment, then it revived; for\r\nthough I forced myself to realise evils, I think I was too prosaic to\r\nidealise, and consequently to exaggerate them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy doubt is whether I should have strength for the undertaking,\u201d I observed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is my own scruple,\u201d said she; \u201cfor you look a worn-out creature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I did. I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed\r\nvision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was\r\nchiefly external: I still felt life at life\u2019s sources.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat else have you in view\u2014anything?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing clear as yet: but I may find something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo you imagine: perhaps you are right. Try your own method, then; and if it\r\ndoes not succeed, test mine. The chance I have offered shall be left open to\r\nyou for three months.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was kind. I told her so, and expressed my gratitude. While I was speaking,\r\na paroxysm of pain came on. I ministered to her; made the necessary\r\napplications, according to her directions, and, by the time she was relieved, a\r\nsort of intimacy was already formed between us. I, for my part, had learned\r\nfrom the manner in which she bore this attack, that she was a firm, patient\r\nwoman (patient under physical pain, though sometimes perhaps excitable under\r\nlong mental canker); and she, from the good-will with which I succoured her,\r\ndiscovered that she could influence my sympathies (such as they were). She sent\r\nfor me the next day; for five or six successive days she claimed my company.\r\nCloser acquaintance, while it developed both faults and eccentricities, opened,\r\nat the same time, a view of a character I could respect. Stern and even morose\r\nas she sometimes was, I could wait on her and sit beside her with that calm\r\nwhich always blesses us when we are sensible that our manners, presence,\r\ncontact, please and soothe the persons we serve. Even when she scolded me\u2014which\r\nshe did, now and then, very tartly\u2014it was in such a way as did not humiliate,\r\nand left no sting; it was rather like an irascible mother rating her daughter,\r\nthan a harsh mistress lecturing a dependant: lecture, indeed, she could not,\r\nthough she could occasionally storm. Moreover, a vein of reason ever ran\r\nthrough her passion: she was logical even when fierce. Ere long a growing sense\r\nof attachment began to present the thought of staying with her as companion in\r\nquite a new light; in another week I had agreed to remain.\r\n\n\r\nTwo hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a crippled old woman, my\r\nmistress, my friend, my all. Her service was my duty\u2014her pain, my suffering\u2014her\r\nrelief, my hope\u2014her anger, my punishment\u2014her regard, my reward. I forgot that\r\nthere were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an ever-changing sky outside the\r\nsteam-dimmed lattice of this sick chamber; I was almost content to forget it.\r\nAll within me became narrowed to my lot. Tame and still by habit, disciplined\r\nby destiny, I demanded no walks in the fresh air; my appetite needed no more\r\nthan the tiny messes served for the invalid. In addition, she gave me the\r\noriginality of her character to study: the steadiness of her virtues, I will\r\nadd, the power of her passions, to admire; the truth of her feelings to trust.\r\nAll these things she had, and for these things I clung to her.\r\n\n\r\nFor these things I would have crawled on with her for twenty years, if for\r\ntwenty years longer her life of endurance had been protracted. But another\r\ndecree was written. It seemed I must be stimulated into action. I must be\r\ngoaded, driven, stung, forced to energy. My little morsel of human affection,\r\nwhich I prized as if it were a solid pearl, must melt in my fingers and slip\r\nthence like a dissolving hailstone. My small adopted duty must be snatched from\r\nmy easily contented conscience. I had wanted to compromise with Fate: to escape\r\noccasional great agonies by submitting to a whole life of privation and small\r\npains. Fate would not so be pacified; nor would Providence sanction this\r\nshrinking sloth and cowardly indolence.\r\n\n\r\nOne February night\u2014I remember it well\u2014there came a voice near Miss Marchmont\u2019s\r\nhouse, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps, only by one. After a\r\ncalm winter, storms were ushering in the spring. I had put Miss Marchmont to\r\nbed; I sat at the fireside sewing. The wind was wailing at the windows; it had\r\nwailed all day; but, as night deepened, it took a new tone\u2014an accent keen,\r\npiercing, almost articulate to the ear; a plaint, piteous and disconsolate to\r\nthe nerves, trilled in every gust.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush! hush!\u201d I said in my disturbed mind, dropping my work, and making a\r\nvain effort to stop my ears against that subtle, searching cry. I had heard\r\nthat very voice ere this, and compulsory observation had forced on me a theory\r\nas to what it boded. Three times in the course of my life, events had taught me\r\nthat these strange accents in the storm\u2014this restless, hopeless cry\u2014denote a\r\ncoming state of the atmosphere unpropitious to life. Epidemic diseases, I\r\nbelieved, were often heralded by a gasping, sobbing, tormented, long-lamenting\r\neast wind. Hence, I inferred, arose the legend of the Banshee. I fancied, too,\r\nI had noticed\u2014but was not philosopher enough to know whether there was any\r\nconnection between the circumstances\u2014that we often at the same time hear of\r\ndisturbed volcanic action in distant parts of the world; of rivers suddenly\r\nrushing above their banks; and of strange high tides flowing furiously in on\r\nlow sea-coasts. \u201cOur globe,\u201d I had said to myself, \u201cseems at such periods torn\r\nand disordered; the feeble amongst us wither in her distempered breath, rushing\r\nhot from steaming volcanoes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI listened and trembled; Miss Marchmont slept.\r\n\n\r\nAbout midnight, the storm in one half-hour fell to a dead calm. The fire, which\r\nhad been burning dead, glowed up vividly. I felt the air change, and become\r\nkeen. Raising blind and curtain, I looked out, and saw in the stars the keen\r\nsparkle of a sharp frost.\r\n\n\r\nTurning away, the object that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake, lifting her\r\nhead from the pillow, and regarding me with unusual earnestness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it a fine night?\u201d she asked.\r\n\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d she said; \u201cfor I feel so strong, so well. Raise me. I feel\r\nyoung to-night,\u201d she continued: \u201cyoung, light-hearted, and happy. What if my\r\ncomplaint be about to take a turn, and I am yet destined to enjoy health? It\r\nwould be a miracle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd these are not the days of miracles,\u201d I thought to myself, and wondered to\r\nhear her talk so. She went on directing her conversation to the past, and\r\nseeming to recall its incidents, scenes, and personages, with singular\r\nvividness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI love Memory to-night,\u201d she said: \u201cI prize her as my best friend. She is just\r\nnow giving me a deep delight: she is bringing back to my heart, in warm and\r\nbeautiful life, realities\u2014not mere empty ideas, but what were once realities,\r\nand that I long have thought decayed, dissolved, mixed in with grave-mould. I\r\npossess just now the hours, the thoughts, the hopes of my youth. I renew the\r\nlove of my life\u2014its only love\u2014almost its only affection; for I am not a\r\nparticularly good woman: I am not amiable. Yet I have had my feelings, strong\r\nand concentrated; and these feelings had their object; which, in its single\r\nself, was dear to me, as to the majority of men and women, are all the\r\nunnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard. While I loved, and\r\nwhile I was loved, what an existence I enjoyed! What a glorious year I can\r\nrecall\u2014how bright it comes back to me! What a living spring\u2014what a warm, glad\r\nsummer\u2014what soft moonlight, silvering the autumn evenings\u2014what strength of hope\r\nunder the ice-bound waters and frost-hoar fields of that year\u2019s winter! Through\r\nthat year my heart lived with Frank\u2019s heart. O my noble Frank\u2014my faithful\r\nFrank\u2014my good Frank! so much better than myself\u2014his standard in all\r\nthings so much higher! This I can now see and say: if few women have suffered\r\nas I did in his loss, few have enjoyed what I did in his love. It was a far\r\nbetter kind of love than common; I had no doubts about it or him: it was such a\r\nlove as honoured, protected, and elevated, no less than it gladdened her to\r\nwhom it was given. Let me now ask, just at this moment, when my mind is so\r\nstrangely clear,\u2014let me reflect why it was taken from me? For what crime was I\r\ncondemned, after twelve months of bliss, to undergo thirty years of sorrow?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d she continued after a pause: \u201cI cannot\u2014cannot see the\r\nreason; yet at this hour I can say with sincerity, what I never tried to say\r\nbefore, Inscrutable God, Thy will be done! And at this moment I can believe\r\nthat death will restore me to Frank. I never believed it till now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead, then?\u201d I inquired in a low voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d she said, \u201cone happy Christmas Eve I dressed and decorated\r\nmyself, expecting my lover, very soon to be my husband, would come that night\r\nto visit me. I sat down to wait. Once more I see that moment\u2014I see the snow\r\ntwilight stealing through the window over which the curtain was not dropped,\r\nfor I designed to watch him ride up the white walk; I see and feel the soft\r\nfirelight warming me, playing on my silk dress, and fitfully showing me my own\r\nyoung figure in a glass. I see the moon of a calm winter night, float full,\r\nclear, and cold, over the inky mass of shrubbery, and the silvered turf of my\r\ngrounds. I wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my breast.\r\nThe flames had died in the fire, but it was a bright mass yet; the moon was\r\nmounting high, but she was still visible from the lattice; the clock neared\r\nten; he rarely tarried later than this, but once or twice he had been delayed\r\nso long.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould he for once fail me? No\u2014not even for once; and now he was coming\u2014and\r\ncoming fast\u2014to atone for lost time. \u2018Frank! you furious rider,\u2019 I said\r\ninwardly, listening gladly, yet anxiously, to his approaching gallop, \u2018you\r\nshall be rebuked for this: I will tell you it is my neck you are putting\r\nin peril; for whatever is yours is, in a dearer and tenderer sense, mine.\u2019\r\nThere he was: I saw him; but I think tears were in my eyes, my sight was so\r\nconfused. I saw the horse; I heard it stamp\u2014I saw at least a mass; I heard a\r\nclamour. Was it a horse? or what heavy, dragging thing was it, crossing,\r\nstrangely dark, the lawn. How could I name that thing in the moonlight before\r\nme? or how could I utter the feeling which rose in my soul?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could only run out. A great animal\u2014truly, Frank\u2019s black horse\u2014stood\r\ntrembling, panting, snorting before the door; a man held it, Frank, as I\r\nthought.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is the matter?\u2019 I demanded. Thomas, my own servant, answered by saying\r\nsharply, \u2018Go into the house, madam.\u2019 And then calling to another servant, who\r\ncame hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by some instinct, \u2018Ruth, take\r\nmissis into the house directly.\u2019 But I was kneeling down in the snow, beside\r\nsomething that lay there\u2014something that I had seen dragged along the\r\nground\u2014something that sighed, that groaned on my breast, as I lifted and drew\r\nit to me. He was not dead; he was not quite unconscious. I had him carried in;\r\nI refused to be ordered about and thrust from him. I was quite collected\r\nenough, not only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others. They had\r\nbegun by trying to treat me like a child, as they always do with people struck\r\nby God\u2019s hand; but I gave place to none except the surgeon; and when he had\r\ndone what he could, I took my dying Frank to myself. He had strength to fold me\r\nin his arms; he had power to speak my name; he heard me as I prayed over him\r\nvery softly; he felt me as I tenderly and fondly comforted him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Maria,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am dying in Paradise.\u2019 He spent his last breath in\r\nfaithful words for me. When the dawn of Christmas morning broke, my Frank was\r\nwith God.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d she went on, \u201chappened thirty years ago. I have suffered since. I\r\ndoubt if I have made the best use of all my calamities. Soft, amiable natures\r\nthey would have refined to saintliness; of strong, evil spirits they would have\r\nmade demons; as for me, I have only been a woe-struck and selfish woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have done much good,\u201d I said; for she was noted for her liberal\r\nalmsgiving.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not withheld money, you mean, where it could assuage affliction. What\r\nof that? It cost me no effort or pang to give. But I think from this day I am\r\nabout to enter a better frame of mind, to prepare myself for reunion with\r\nFrank. You see I still think of Frank more than of God; and unless it be\r\ncounted that in thus loving the creature so much, so long, and so exclusively,\r\nI have not at least blasphemed the Creator, small is my chance of salvation.\r\nWhat do you think, Lucy, of these things? Be my chaplain, and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis question I could not answer: I had no words. It seemed as if she thought I\r\nhad answered it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery right, my child. We should acknowledge God merciful, but not always for\r\nus comprehensible. We should accept our own lot, whatever it be, and try to\r\nrender happy that of others. Should we not? Well, to-morrow I will begin by\r\ntrying to make you happy. I will endeavour to do something for you, Lucy:\r\nsomething that will benefit you when I am dead. My head aches now with talking\r\ntoo much; still I am happy. Go to bed. The clock strikes two. How late you sit\r\nup; or rather how late I, in my selfishness, keep you up. But go now; have no\r\nmore anxiety for me; I feel I shall rest well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe composed herself as if to slumber. I, too, retired to my crib in a closet\r\nwithin her room. The night passed in quietness; quietly her doom must at last\r\nhave come: peacefully and painlessly: in the morning she was found without\r\nlife, nearly cold, but all calm and undisturbed. Her previous excitement of\r\nspirits and change of mood had been the prelude of a fit; one stroke sufficed\r\nto sever the thread of an existence so long fretted by affliction.\r\n\n"}
{"6": "\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTURNING A NEW LEAF.\n\r\nMy mistress being dead, and I once more alone, I had to look out for a new\r\nplace. About this time I might be a little\u2014a very little\u2014shaken in nerves. I\r\ngrant I was not looking well, but, on the contrary, thin, haggard, and\r\nhollow-eyed; like a sitter-up at night, like an overwrought servant, or a\r\nplaceless person in debt. In debt, however, I was not; nor quite poor; for\r\nthough Miss Marchmont had not had time to benefit me, as, on that last night,\r\nshe said she intended, yet, after the funeral, my wages were duly paid by her\r\nsecond cousin, the heir, an avaricious-looking man, with pinched nose and\r\nnarrow temples, who, indeed, I heard long afterwards, turned out a thorough\r\nmiser: a direct contrast to his generous kinswoman, and a foil to her memory,\r\nblessed to this day by the poor and needy. The possessor, then, of fifteen\r\npounds; of health, though worn, not broken, and of a spirit in similar\r\ncondition; I might still; in comparison with many people, be regarded as\r\noccupying an enviable position. An embarrassing one it was, however, at the\r\nsame time; as I felt with some acuteness on a certain day, of which the\r\ncorresponding one in the next week was to see my departure from my present\r\nabode, while with another I was not provided.\r\n\n\r\nIn this dilemma I went, as a last and sole resource, to see and consult an old\r\nservant of our family; once my nurse, now housekeeper at a grand mansion not\r\nfar from Miss Marchmont\u2019s. I spent some hours with her; she comforted, but knew\r\nnot how to advise me. Still all inward darkness, I left her about twilight; a\r\nwalk of two miles lay before me; it was a clear, frosty night. In spite of my\r\nsolitude, my poverty, and my perplexity, my heart, nourished and nerved with\r\nthe vigour of a youth that had not yet counted twenty-three summers, beat light\r\nand not feebly. Not feebly, I am sure, or I should have trembled in that lonely\r\nwalk, which lay through still fields, and passed neither village nor farmhouse,\r\nnor cottage: I should have quailed in the absence of moonlight, for it was by\r\nthe leading of stars only I traced the dim path; I should have quailed still\r\nmore in the unwonted presence of that which to-night shone in the north, a\r\nmoving mystery\u2014the Aurora Borealis. But this solemn stranger influenced me\r\notherwise than through my fears. Some new power it seemed to bring. I drew in\r\nenergy with the keen, low breeze that blew on its path. A bold thought was sent\r\nto my mind; my mind was made strong to receive it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave this wilderness,\u201d it was said to me, \u201cand go out hence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d was the query.\r\n\n\r\nI had not very far to look; gazing from this country parish in that flat, rich\r\nmiddle of England\u2014I mentally saw within reach what I had never yet beheld with\r\nmy bodily eyes: I saw London.\r\n\n\r\nThe next day I returned to the hall, and asking once more to see the\r\nhousekeeper, I communicated to her my plan.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Barrett was a grave, judicious woman, though she knew little more of the\r\nworld than myself; but grave and judicious as she was, she did not charge me\r\nwith being out of my senses; and, indeed, I had a staid manner of my own which\r\nere now had been as good to me as cloak and hood of hodden grey, since under\r\nits favour I had been enabled to achieve with impunity, and even approbation,\r\ndeeds that, if attempted with an excited and unsettled air, would in some minds\r\nhave stamped me as a dreamer and zealot.\r\n\n\r\nThe housekeeper was slowly propounding some difficulties, while she prepared\r\norange-rind for marmalade, when a child ran past the window and came bounding\r\ninto the room. It was a pretty child, and as it danced, laughing, up to me\u2014for\r\nwe were not strangers (nor, indeed, was its mother\u2014a young married daughter of\r\nthe house\u2014a stranger)\u2014I took it on my knee.\r\n\n\r\nDifferent as were our social positions now, this child\u2019s mother and I had been\r\nschoolfellows, when I was a girl of ten and she a young lady of sixteen; and I\r\nremembered her, good-looking, but dull, in a lower class than mine.\r\n\n\r\nI was admiring the boy\u2019s handsome dark eyes, when the mother, young Mrs. Leigh,\r\nentered. What a beautiful and kind-looking woman was the good-natured and\r\ncomely, but unintellectual, girl become! Wifehood and maternity had changed her\r\nthus, as I have since seen them change others even less promising than she. Me\r\nshe had forgotten. I was changed too, though not, I fear, for the better. I\r\nmade no attempt to recall myself to her memory; why should I? She came for her\r\nson to accompany her in a walk, and behind her followed a nurse, carrying an\r\ninfant. I only mention the incident because, in addressing the nurse, Mrs.\r\nLeigh spoke French (very bad French, by the way, and with an incorrigibly bad\r\naccent, again forcibly reminding me of our school-days): and I found the woman\r\nwas a foreigner. The little boy chattered volubly in French too. When the whole\r\nparty were withdrawn, Mrs. Barrett remarked that her young lady had brought\r\nthat foreign nurse home with her two years ago, on her return from a\r\nContinental excursion; that she was treated almost as well as a governess, and\r\nhad nothing to do but walk out with the baby and chatter French with Master\r\nCharles; \u201cand,\u201d added Mrs. Barrett, \u201cshe says there are many Englishwomen in\r\nforeign families as well placed as she.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI stored up this piece of casual information, as careful housewives store\r\nseemingly worthless shreds and fragments for which their prescient minds\r\nanticipate a possible use some day. Before I left my old friend, she gave me\r\nthe address of a respectable old-fashioned inn in the City, which, she said, my\r\nuncles used to frequent in former days.\r\n\n\r\nIn going to London, I ran less risk and evinced less enterprise than the reader\r\nmay think. In fact, the distance was only fifty miles. My means would suffice\r\nboth to take me there, to keep me a few days, and also to bring me back if I\r\nfound no inducement to stay. I regarded it as a brief holiday, permitted for\r\nonce to work-weary faculties, rather than as an adventure of life and death.\r\nThere is nothing like taking all you do at a moderate estimate: it keeps mind\r\nand body tranquil; whereas grandiloquent notions are apt to hurry both into\r\nfever.\r\n\n\r\nFifty miles were then a day\u2019s journey (for I speak of a time gone by: my hair,\r\nwhich, till a late period, withstood the frosts of time, lies now, at last\r\nwhite, under a white cap, like snow beneath snow). About nine o\u2019clock of a wet\r\nFebruary night I reached London.\r\n\n\r\nMy reader, I know, is one who would not thank me for an elaborate reproduction\r\nof poetic first impressions; and it is well, inasmuch as I had neither time nor\r\nmood to cherish such; arriving as I did late, on a dark, raw, and rainy\r\nevening, in a Babylon and a wilderness, of which the vastness and the\r\nstrangeness tried to the utmost any powers of clear thought and steady\r\nself-possession with which, in the absence of more brilliant faculties, Nature\r\nmight have gifted me.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I left the coach, the strange speech of the cabmen and others waiting\r\nround, seemed to me odd as a foreign tongue. I had never before heard the\r\nEnglish language chopped up in that way. However, I managed to understand and\r\nto be understood, so far as to get myself and trunk safely conveyed to the old\r\ninn whereof I had the address. How difficult, how oppressive, how puzzling\r\nseemed my flight! In London for the first time; at an inn for the first time;\r\ntired with travelling; confused with darkness; palsied with cold; unfurnished\r\nwith either experience or advice to tell me how to act, and yet\u2014to act obliged.\r\n\n\r\nInto the hands of common sense I confided the matter. Common sense, however,\r\nwas as chilled and bewildered as all my other faculties, and it was only under\r\nthe spur of an inexorable necessity that she spasmodically executed her trust.\r\nThus urged, she paid the porter: considering the crisis, I did not blame her\r\ntoo much that she was hugely cheated; she asked the waiter for a room; she\r\ntimorously called for the chambermaid; what is far more, she bore, without\r\nbeing wholly overcome, a highly supercilious style of demeanour from that young\r\nlady, when she appeared.\r\n\n\r\nI recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of town prettiness and\r\nsmartness. So trim her waist, her cap, her dress\u2014I wondered how they had all\r\nbeen manufactured. Her speech had an accent which in its mincing glibness\r\nseemed to rebuke mine as by authority; her spruce attire flaunted an easy scorn\r\nto my plain country garb.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d I thought, \u201cand then the scene is new, and the\r\ncircumstances; I shall gain good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMaintaining a very quiet manner towards this arrogant little maid, and\r\nsubsequently observing the same towards the parsonic-looking, black-coated,\r\nwhite-neckclothed waiter, I got civility from them ere long. I believe at first\r\nthey thought I was a servant; but in a little while they changed their minds,\r\nand hovered in a doubtful state between patronage and politeness.\r\n\n\r\nI kept up well till I had partaken of some refreshment, warmed myself by a\r\nfire, and was fairly shut into my own room; but, as I sat down by the bed and\r\nrested my head and arms on the pillow, a terrible oppression overcame me. All\r\nat once my position rose on me like a ghost. Anomalous, desolate, almost blank\r\nof hope it stood. What was I doing here alone in great London? What should I do\r\non the morrow? What prospects had I in life? What friends had I on earth?\r\nWhence did I come? Whither should I go? What should I do?\r\n\n\r\nI wet the pillow, my arms, and my hair, with rushing tears. A dark interval of\r\nmost bitter thought followed this burst; but I did not regret the step taken,\r\nnor wish to retract it. A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go\r\nforward than backward, and that I could go forward\u2014that a way, however\r\nnarrow and difficult, would in time open\u2014predominated over other feelings: its\r\ninfluence hushed them so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be\r\nable to say my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and\r\nlain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I\r\nknew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal hum\r\nand trembling knell, I said: \u201cI lie in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"7": "\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nLONDON.\n\r\nThe next day was the first of March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened my\r\ncurtain, I saw the risen sun struggling through fog. Above my head, above the\r\nhouse-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a solemn, orbed mass, dark\r\nblue and dim\u2014THE DOME. While I looked, my inner self moved; my spirit shook its\r\nalways-fettered wings half loose; I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet\r\ntruly lived, were at last about to taste life. In that morning my soul grew as\r\nfast as Jonah\u2019s gourd.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did well to come,\u201d I said, proceeding to dress with speed and care. \u201cI like\r\nthe spirit of this great London which I feel around me. Who but a coward would\r\npass his whole life in hamlets; and for ever abandon his faculties to the\r\neating rust of obscurity?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBeing dressed, I went down; not travel-worn and exhausted, but tidy and\r\nrefreshed. When the waiter came in with my breakfast, I managed to accost him\r\nsedately, yet cheerfully; we had ten minutes\u2019 discourse, in the course of which\r\nwe became usefully known to each other.\r\n\n\r\nHe was a grey-haired, elderly man; and, it seemed, had lived in his present\r\nplace twenty years. Having ascertained this, I was sure he must remember my two\r\nuncles, Charles and Wilmot, who, fifteen, years ago, were frequent visitors\r\nhere. I mentioned their names; he recalled them perfectly, and with respect.\r\nHaving intimated my connection, my position in his eyes was henceforth clear,\r\nand on a right footing. He said I was like my uncle Charles: I suppose he spoke\r\ntruth, because Mrs. Barrett was accustomed to say the same thing. A ready and\r\nobliging courtesy now replaced his former uncomfortably doubtful manner;\r\nhenceforth I need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a sensible\r\nquestion.\r\n\n\r\nThe street on which my little sitting-room window looked was narrow, perfectly\r\nquiet, and not dirty: the few passengers were just such as one sees in\r\nprovincial towns: here was nothing formidable; I felt sure I might venture out\r\nalone.\r\n\n\r\nHaving breakfasted, out I went. Elation and pleasure were in my heart: to walk\r\nalone in London seemed of itself an adventure. Presently I found myself in\r\nPaternoster Row\u2014classic ground this. I entered a bookseller\u2019s shop, kept by one\r\nJones: I bought a little book\u2014a piece of extravagance I could ill afford; but I\r\nthought I would one day give or send it to Mrs. Barrett. Mr. Jones, a dried-in\r\nman of business, stood behind his desk: he seemed one of the greatest, and I\r\none of the happiest of beings.\r\n\n\r\nProdigious was the amount of life I lived that morning. Finding myself before\r\nSt. Paul\u2019s, I went in; I mounted to the dome: I saw thence London, with its\r\nriver, and its bridges, and its churches; I saw antique Westminster, and the\r\ngreen Temple Gardens, with sun upon them, and a glad, blue sky, of early spring\r\nabove; and between them and it, not too dense, a cloud of haze.\r\n\n\r\nDescending, I went wandering whither chance might lead, in a still ecstasy of\r\nfreedom and enjoyment; and I got\u2014I know not how\u2014I got into the heart of city\r\nlife. I saw and felt London at last: I got into the Strand; I went up Cornhill;\r\nI mixed with the life passing along; I dared the perils of crossings. To do\r\nthis, and to do it utterly alone, gave me, perhaps an irrational, but a real\r\npleasure. Since those days, I have seen the West End, the parks, the fine\r\nsquares; but I love the city far better. The city seems so much more in\r\nearnest: its business, its rush, its roar, are such serious things, sights, and\r\nsounds. The city is getting its living\u2014the West End but enjoying its pleasure.\r\nAt the West End you may be amused, but in the city you are deeply excited.\r\n\n\r\nFaint, at last, and hungry (it was years since I had felt such healthy hunger),\r\nI returned, about two o\u2019clock, to my dark, old, and quiet inn. I dined on two\r\ndishes\u2014a plain joint and vegetables; both seemed excellent: how much better\r\nthan the small, dainty messes Miss Marchmont\u2019s cook used to send up to my kind,\r\ndead mistress and me, and to the discussion of which we could not bring half an\r\nappetite between us! Delightfully tired, I lay down, on three chairs for an\r\nhour (the room did not boast a sofa). I slept, then I woke and thought for two\r\nhours.\r\n\n\r\nMy state of mind, and all accompanying circumstances, were just now such as\r\nmost to favour the adoption of a new, resolute, and daring\u2014perhaps\r\ndesperate\u2014line of action. I had nothing to lose. Unutterable loathing of a\r\ndesolate existence past, forbade return. If I failed in what I now designed to\r\nundertake, who, save myself, would suffer? If I died far away from\u2014home, I was\r\ngoing to say, but I had no home\u2014from England, then, who would weep?\r\n\n\r\nI might suffer; I was inured to suffering: death itself had not, I thought,\r\nthose terrors for me which it has for the softly reared. I had, ere this,\r\nlooked on the thought of death with a quiet eye. Prepared, then, for any\r\nconsequences, I formed a project.\r\n\n\r\nThat same evening I obtained from my friend, the waiter, information\r\nrespecting, the sailing of vessels for a certain continental port, Boue-Marine.\r\nNo time, I found, was to be lost: that very night I must take my berth. I\r\nmight, indeed, have waited till the morning before going on board, but would\r\nnot run the risk of being too late.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter take your berth at once, ma\u2019am,\u201d counselled the waiter. I agreed with\r\nhim, and having discharged my bill, and acknowledged my friend\u2019s services at a\r\nrate which I now know was princely, and which in his eyes must have seemed\r\nabsurd\u2014and indeed, while pocketing the cash, he smiled a faint smile which\r\nintimated his opinion of the donor\u2019s savoir-faire\u2014he proceeded to call a\r\ncoach. To the driver he also recommended me, giving at the same time an\r\ninjunction about taking me, I think, to the wharf, and not leaving me to the\r\nwatermen; which that functionary promised to observe, but failed in keeping his\r\npromise: on the contrary, he offered me up as an oblation, served me as a\r\ndripping roast, making me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen.\r\n\n\r\nThis was an uncomfortable crisis. It was a dark night. The coachman instantly\r\ndrove off as soon as he had got his fare: the watermen commenced a struggle for\r\nme and my trunk. Their oaths I hear at this moment: they shook my philosophy\r\nmore than did the night, or the isolation, or the strangeness of the scene. One\r\nlaid hands on my trunk. I looked on and waited quietly; but when another laid\r\nhands on me, I spoke up, shook off his touch, stepped at once into a boat,\r\ndesired austerely that the trunk should be placed beside me\u2014\u201cJust there,\u201d\u2014which\r\nwas instantly done; for the owner of the boat I had chosen became now an ally:\r\nI was rowed off.\r\n\n\r\nBlack was the river as a torrent of ink; lights glanced on it from the piles of\r\nbuilding round, ships rocked on its bosom. They rowed me up to several vessels;\r\nI read by lantern-light their names painted in great white letters on a dark\r\nground. \u201cThe Ocean,\u201d \u201cThe Phoenix,\u201d \u201cThe Consort,\u201d \u201cThe Dolphin,\u201d were passed\r\nin turns; but \u201cThe Vivid\u201d was my ship, and it seemed she lay further down.\r\n\n\r\nDown the sable flood we glided, I thought of the Styx, and of Charon rowing\r\nsome solitary soul to the Land of Shades. Amidst the strange scene, with a\r\nchilly wind blowing in my face and midnight clouds dropping rain above my head;\r\nwith two rude rowers for companions, whose insane oaths still tortured my ear,\r\nI asked myself if I was wretched or terrified. I was neither. Often in my life\r\nhave I been far more so under comparatively safe circumstances. \u201cHow is this?\u201d\r\nsaid I. \u201cMethinks I am animated and alert, instead of being depressed and\r\napprehensive?\u201d I could not tell how it was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTHE VIVID\u201d started out, white and glaring, from the black night at last.\u2014\u201cHere\r\nyou are!\u201d said the waterman, and instantly demanded six shillings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ask too much,\u201d I said. He drew off from the vessel and swore he would not\r\nembark me till I paid it. A young man, the steward as I found afterwards, was\r\nlooking over the ship\u2019s side; he grinned a smile in anticipation of the coming\r\ncontest; to disappoint him, I paid the money. Three times that afternoon I had\r\ngiven crowns where I should have given shillings; but I consoled myself with\r\nthe reflection, \u201cIt is the price of experience.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cheated you!\u201d said the steward exultingly when I got on board. I\r\nanswered phlegmatically that \u201cI knew it,\u201d and went below.\r\n\n\r\nA stout, handsome, and showy woman was in the ladies\u2019 cabin. I asked to be\r\nshown my berth; she looked hard at me, muttered something about its being\r\nunusual for passengers to come on board at that hour, and seemed disposed to be\r\nless than civil. What a face she had\u2014so comely\u2014so insolent and so selfish!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow that I am on board, I shall certainly stay here,\u201d was my answer. \u201cI will\r\ntrouble you to show me my berth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe complied, but sullenly. I took off my bonnet, arranged my things, and lay\r\ndown. Some difficulties had been passed through; a sort of victory was won: my\r\nhomeless, anchorless, unsupported mind had again leisure for a brief repose.\r\nTill the \u201cVivid\u201d arrived in harbour, no further action would be required of me;\r\nbut then\u2026. Oh! I could not look forward. Harassed, exhausted, I lay in a\r\nhalf-trance.\r\n\n\r\nThe stewardess talked all night; not to me but to the young steward, her son\r\nand her very picture. He passed in and out of the cabin continually: they\r\ndisputed, they quarrelled, they made it up again twenty times in the course of\r\nthe night. She professed to be writing a letter home\u2014she said to her father;\r\nshe read passages of it aloud, heeding me no more than a stock\u2014perhaps she\r\nbelieved me asleep. Several of these passages appeared to comprise family\r\nsecrets, and bore special reference to one \u201cCharlotte,\u201d a younger sister who,\r\nfrom the bearing of the epistle, seemed to be on the brink of perpetrating a\r\nromantic and imprudent match; loud was the protest of this elder lady against\r\nthe distasteful union. The dutiful son laughed his mother\u2019s correspondence to\r\nscorn. She defended it, and raved at him. They were a strange pair. She might\r\nbe thirty-nine or forty, and was buxom and blooming as a girl of twenty. Hard,\r\nloud, vain and vulgar, her mind and body alike seemed brazen and imperishable.\r\nI should think, from her childhood, she must have lived in public stations; and\r\nin her youth might very likely have been a barmaid.\r\n\n\r\nTowards morning her discourse ran on a new theme: \u201cthe Watsons,\u201d a certain\r\nexpected family-party of passengers, known to her, it appeared, and by her much\r\nesteemed on account of the handsome profit realized in their fees. She said,\r\n\u201cIt was as good as a little fortune to her whenever this family crossed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt dawn all were astir, and by sunrise the passengers came on board. Boisterous\r\nwas the welcome given by the stewardess to the \u201cWatsons,\u201d and great was the\r\nbustle made in their honour. They were four in number, two males and two\r\nfemales. Besides them, there was but one other passenger\u2014a young lady, whom a\r\ngentlemanly, though languid-looking man escorted. The two groups offered a\r\nmarked contrast. The Watsons were doubtless rich people, for they had the\r\nconfidence of conscious wealth in their bearing; the women\u2014youthful both of\r\nthem, and one perfectly handsome, as far as physical beauty went\u2014were dressed\r\nrichly, gaily, and absurdly out of character for the circumstances. Their\r\nbonnets with bright flowers, their velvet cloaks and silk dresses, seemed\r\nbetter suited for park or promenade than for a damp packet deck. The men were\r\nof low stature, plain, fat, and vulgar; the oldest, plainest, greasiest,\r\nbroadest, I soon found was the husband\u2014the bridegroom I suppose, for she was\r\nvery young\u2014of the beautiful girl. Deep was my amazement at this discovery; and\r\ndeeper still when I perceived that, instead of being desperately wretched in\r\nsuch a union, she was gay even to giddiness. \u201cHer laughter,\u201d I reflected, \u201cmust\r\nbe the mere frenzy of despair.\u201d And even while this thought was crossing my\r\nmind, as I stood leaning quiet and solitary against the ship\u2019s side, she came\r\ntripping up to me, an utter stranger, with a camp-stool in her hand, and\r\nsmiling a smile of which the levity puzzled and startled me, though it showed a\r\nperfect set of perfect teeth, she offered me the accommodation of this piece of\r\nfurniture. I declined it of course, with all the courtesy I could put into my\r\nmanner; she danced off heedless and lightsome. She must have been good-natured;\r\nbut what had made her marry that individual, who was at least as much like an\r\noil-barrel as a man?\r\n\n\r\nThe other lady passenger, with the gentleman-companion, was quite a girl,\r\npretty and fair: her simple print dress, untrimmed straw-bonnet and large\r\nshawl, gracefully worn, formed a costume plain to quakerism: yet, for her,\r\nbecoming enough. Before the gentleman quitted her, I observed him throwing a\r\nglance of scrutiny over all the passengers, as if to ascertain in what company\r\nhis charge would be left. With a most dissatisfied air did his eye turn from\r\nthe ladies with the gay flowers; he looked at me, and then he spoke to his\r\ndaughter, niece, or whatever she was: she also glanced in my direction, and\r\nslightly curled her short, pretty lip. It might be myself, or it might be my\r\nhomely mourning habit, that elicited this mark of contempt; more likely, both.\r\nA bell rang; her father (I afterwards knew that it was her father) kissed her,\r\nand returned to land. The packet sailed.\r\n\n\r\nForeigners say that it is only English girls who can thus be trusted to travel\r\nalone, and deep is their wonder at the daring confidence of English parents and\r\nguardians. As for the \u201cjeunes Meess,\u201d by some their intrepidity is pronounced\r\nmasculine and \u201cinconvenant,\u201d others regard them as the passive victims of an\r\neducational and theological system which wantonly dispenses with proper\r\n\u201csurveillance.\u201d Whether this particular young lady was of the sort that can the\r\nmost safely be left unwatched, I do not know: or, rather did not then\r\nknow; but it soon appeared that the dignity of solitude was not to her taste.\r\nShe paced the deck once or twice backwards and forwards; she looked with a\r\nlittle sour air of disdain at the flaunting silks and velvets, and the bears\r\nwhich thereon danced attendance, and eventually she approached me and spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you fond of a sea-voyage?\u201d was her question.\r\n\n\r\nI explained that my fondness for a sea-voyage had yet to undergo the\r\ntest of experience; I had never made one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, how charming!\u201d cried she. \u201cI quite envy you the novelty: first\r\nimpressions, you know, are so pleasant. Now I have made so many, I quite forget\r\nthe first: I am quite blas\u00e9e about the sea and all that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help smiling.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you laugh at me?\u201d she inquired, with a frank testiness that pleased me\r\nbetter than her other talk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are so young to be blas\u00e9e about anything.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am seventeen\u201d (a little piqued).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou hardly look sixteen. Do you like travelling alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! I care nothing about it. I have crossed the Channel ten times, alone; but\r\nthen I take care never to be long alone: I always make friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will scarcely make many friends this voyage, I think\u201d (glancing at the\r\nWatson-group, who were now laughing and making a great deal of noise on deck).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot of those odious men and women,\u201d said she: \u201csuch people should be steerage\r\npassengers. Are you going to school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not the least idea\u2014beyond, at least, the port of Boue-Marine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stared, then carelessly ran on:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am going to school. Oh, the number of foreign schools I have been at in my\r\nlife! And yet I am quite an ignoramus. I know nothing\u2014nothing in the world\u2014I\r\nassure you; except that I play and dance beautifully,\u2014and French and German of\r\ncourse I know, to speak; but I can\u2019t read or write them very well. Do you know\r\nthey wanted me to translate a page of an easy German book into English the\r\nother day, and I couldn\u2019t do it. Papa was so mortified: he says it looks as if\r\nM. de Bassompierre\u2014my godpapa, who pays all my school-bills\u2014had thrown away all\r\nhis money. And then, in matters of information\u2014in history, geography,\r\narithmetic, and so on, I am quite a baby; and I write English so badly\u2014such\r\nspelling and grammar, they tell me. Into the bargain I have quite forgotten my\r\nreligion; they call me a Protestant, you know, but really I am not sure whether\r\nI am one or not: I don\u2019t well know the difference between Romanism and\r\nProtestantism. However, I don\u2019t in the least care for that. I was a Lutheran\r\nonce at Bonn\u2014dear Bonn!\u2014charming Bonn!\u2014where there were so many handsome\r\nstudents. Every nice girl in our school had an admirer; they knew our hours for\r\nwalking out, and almost always passed us on the promenade: \u2018Sch\u00f6nes M\u00e4dchen,\u2019\r\nwe used to hear them say. I was excessively happy at Bonn!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where are you now?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! at\u2014chose,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\nNow, Miss Ginevra Fanshawe (such was this young person\u2019s name) only substituted\r\nthis word \u201cchose\u201d in temporary oblivion of the real name. It was a habit\r\nshe had: \u201cchose\u201d came in at every turn in her conversation\u2014the\r\nconvenient substitute for any missing word in any language she might chance at\r\nthe time to be speaking. French girls often do the like; from them she had\r\ncaught the custom. \u201cChose,\u201d however, I found in this instance, stood for\r\nVillette\u2014the great capital of the great kingdom of Labassecour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like Villette?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty well. The natives, you know, are intensely stupid and vulgar; but there\r\nare some nice English families.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you in a school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good one?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! horrid: but I go out every Sunday, and care nothing about the\r\nma\u00eetresses or the professeurs, or the \u00e9l\u00e8ves, and send\r\nlessons au diable (one daren\u2019t say that in English, you know, but it\r\nsounds quite right in French); and thus I get on charmingly\u2026. You are laughing\r\nat me again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I am only smiling at my own thoughts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d (Without waiting for an answer)\u2014\u201cNow, do tell me where\r\nyou are going.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere Fate may lead me. My business is to earn a living where I can find it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo earn!\u201d (in consternation) \u201care you poor, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs poor as Job.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cBah! how unpleasant! But I know what it is to be poor:\r\nthey are poor enough at home\u2014papa and mamma, and all of them. Papa is called\r\nCaptain Fanshawe; he is an officer on half-pay, but well-descended, and some of\r\nour connections are great enough; but my uncle and godpapa De Bassompierre, who\r\nlives in France, is the only one that helps us: he educates us girls. I have\r\nfive sisters and three brothers. By-and-by we are to marry\u2014rather elderly\r\ngentlemen, I suppose, with cash: papa and mamma manage that. My sister Augusta\r\nis married now to a man much older-looking than papa. Augusta is very\r\nbeautiful\u2014not in my style\u2014but dark; her husband, Mr. Davies, had the yellow\r\nfever in India, and he is still the colour of a guinea; but then he is rich,\r\nand Augusta has her carriage and establishment, and we all think she has done\r\nperfectly well. Now, this is better than \u2018earning a living,\u2019 as you say. By the\r\nway, are you clever?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou can play, sing, speak three or four languages?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill I think you are clever\u201d (a pause and a yawn).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall you be sea-sick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, immensely! as soon as ever we get in sight of the sea: I begin, indeed, to\r\nfeel it already. I shall go below; and won\u2019t I order about that fat odious\r\nstewardess! Heureusement je sais faire aller mon monde.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDown she went.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not long before the other passengers followed her: throughout the\r\nafternoon I remained on deck alone. When I recall the tranquil, and even happy\r\nmood in which I passed those hours, and remember, at the same time, the\r\nposition in which I was placed; its hazardous\u2014some would have said its\r\nhopeless\u2014character; I feel that, as\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStone walls do not a prison make,\r\nNor iron bars\u2014a cage,\u201d\r\n\n\r\nso peril, loneliness, an uncertain future, are not oppressive evils, so long as\r\nthe frame is healthy and the faculties are employed; so long, especially, as\r\nLiberty lends us her wings, and Hope guides us by her star.\r\n\n\r\nI was not sick till long after we passed Margate, and deep was the pleasure I\r\ndrank in with the sea-breeze; divine the delight I drew from the heaving\r\nChannel waves, from the sea-birds on their ridges, from the white sails on\r\ntheir dark distance, from the quiet yet beclouded sky, overhanging all. In my\r\nreverie, methought I saw the continent of Europe, like a wide dream-land, far\r\naway. Sunshine lay on it, making the long coast one line of gold; tiniest\r\ntracery of clustered town and snow-gleaming tower, of woods deep massed, of\r\nheights serrated, of smooth pasturage and veiny stream, embossed the\r\nmetal-bright prospect. For background, spread a sky, solemn and dark blue,\r\nand\u2014grand with imperial promise, soft with tints of enchantment\u2014strode from\r\nnorth to south a God-bent bow, an arch of hope.\r\n\n\r\nCancel the whole of that, if you please, reader\u2014or rather let it stand, and\r\ndraw thence a moral\u2014an alliterative, text-hand copy\u2014\r\n\n\r\nDay-dreams are delusions of the demon.\r\n\n\r\nBecoming excessively sick, I faltered down into the cabin.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Fanshawe\u2019s berth chanced to be next mine; and, I am sorry to say, she\r\ntormented me with an unsparing selfishness during the whole time of our mutual\r\ndistress. Nothing could exceed her impatience and fretfulness. The Watsons, who\r\nwere very sick too, and on whom the stewardess attended with shameless\r\npartiality, were stoics compared with her. Many a time since have I noticed, in\r\npersons of Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s light, careless temperament, and fair, fragile\r\nstyle of beauty, an entire incapacity to endure: they seem to sour in\r\nadversity, like small beer in thunder. The man who takes such a woman for his\r\nwife, ought to be prepared to guarantee her an existence all sunshine.\r\nIndignant at last with her teasing peevishness, I curtly requested her \u201cto hold\r\nher tongue.\u201d The rebuff did her good, and it was observable that she liked me\r\nno worse for it.\r\n\n\r\nAs dark night drew on, the sea roughened: larger waves swayed strong against\r\nthe vessel\u2019s side. It was strange to reflect that blackness and water were\r\nround us, and to feel the ship ploughing straight on her pathless way, despite\r\nnoise, billow, and rising gale. Articles of furniture began to fall about, and\r\nit became needful to lash them to their places; the passengers grew sicker than\r\never; Miss Fanshawe declared, with groans, that she must die.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot just yet, honey,\u201d said the stewardess. \u201cWe\u2019re just in port.\u201d Accordingly,\r\nin another quarter of an hour, a calm fell upon us all; and about midnight the\r\nvoyage ended.\r\n\n\r\nI was sorry: yes, I was sorry. My resting-time was past; my difficulties\u2014my\r\nstringent difficulties\u2014recommenced. When I went on deck, the cold air and black\r\nscowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for my presumption in being where I was:\r\nthe lights of the foreign sea-port town, glimmering round the foreign harbour,\r\nmet me like unnumbered threatening eyes. Friends came on board to welcome the\r\nWatsons; a whole family of friends surrounded and bore away Miss Fanshawe;\r\nI\u2014but I dared not for one moment dwell on a comparison of positions.\r\n\n\r\nYet where should I go? I must go somewhere. Necessity dare not be nice. As I\r\ngave the stewardess her fee\u2014and she seemed surprised at receiving a coin of\r\nmore value than, from such a quarter, her coarse calculations had probably\r\nreckoned on\u2014I said, \u201cBe kind enough to direct me to some quiet, respectable\r\ninn, where I can go for the night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe not only gave me the required direction, but called a commissionaire, and\r\nbid him take charge of me, and\u2014not my trunk, for that was gone to the\r\ncustom-house.\r\n\n\r\nI followed this man along a rudely-paved street, lit now by a fitful gleam of\r\nmoonlight; he brought me to the inn. I offered him sixpence, which he refused\r\nto take; supposing it not enough, I changed it for a shilling; but this also he\r\ndeclined, speaking rather sharply, in a language to me unknown. A waiter,\r\ncoming forward into the lamp-lit inn-passage, reminded me, in broken English,\r\nthat my money was foreign money, not current here. I gave him a sovereign to\r\nchange. This little matter settled, I asked for a bedroom; supper I could not\r\ntake: I was still sea-sick and unnerved, and trembling all over. How deeply\r\nglad I was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my\r\nexhaustion. Again I might rest: though the cloud of doubt would be as thick\r\nto-morrow as ever; the necessity for exertion more urgent, the peril (of\r\ndestitution) nearer, the conflict (for existence) more severe.\r\n\n"}
{"8": "\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nVILLETTE.\n\r\nI awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed: physical\r\ndebility no longer enervated my judgment; my mind felt prompt and clear.\r\n\n\r\nJust as I finished dressing, a tap came to the door: I said, \u201cCome in,\u201d\r\nexpecting the chambermaid, whereas a rough man walked in and said,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGif me your keys, Meess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGif!\u201d said he impatiently; and as he half-snatched them from my hand, he\r\nadded, \u201cAll right! haf your tronc soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFortunately it did turn out all right: he was from the custom-house. Where to\r\ngo to get some breakfast I could not tell; but I proceeded, not without\r\nhesitation, to descend.\r\n\n\r\nI now observed, what I had not noticed in my extreme weariness last night, viz.\r\nthat this inn was, in fact, a large hotel; and as I slowly descended the broad\r\nstaircase, halting on each step (for I was in wonderfully little haste to get\r\ndown), I gazed at the high ceiling above me, at the painted walls around, at\r\nthe wide windows which filled the house with light, at the veined marble I trod\r\n(for the steps were all of marble, though uncarpeted and not very clean), and\r\ncontrasting all this with the dimensions of the closet assigned to me as a\r\nchamber, with the extreme modesty of its appointments, I fell into a\r\nphilosophizing mood.\r\n\n\r\nMuch I marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters and chamber-maids in\r\nproportioning the accommodation to the guest. How could inn-servants and\r\nship-stewardesses everywhere tell at a glance that I, for instance, was an\r\nindividual of no social significance, and little burdened by cash? They\r\ndid know it evidently: I saw quite well that they all, in a moment\u2019s\r\ncalculation, estimated me at about the same fractional value. The fact seemed\r\nto me curious and pregnant: I would not disguise from myself what it indicated,\r\nyet managed to keep up my spirits pretty well under its pressure.\r\n\n\r\nHaving at last landed in a great hall, full of skylight glare, I made my way\r\nsomehow to what proved to be the coffee-room. It cannot be denied that on\r\nentering this room I trembled somewhat; felt uncertain, solitary, wretched;\r\nwished to Heaven I knew whether I was doing right or wrong; felt convinced that\r\nit was the last, but could not help myself. Acting in the spirit and with the\r\ncalm of a fatalist, I sat down at a small table, to which a waiter presently\r\nbrought me some breakfast; and I partook of that meal in a frame of mind not\r\ngreatly calculated to favour digestion. There were many other people\r\nbreakfasting at other tables in the room; I should have felt rather more happy\r\nif amongst them all I could have seen any women; however, there was not one\u2014all\r\npresent were men. But nobody seemed to think I was doing anything strange; one\r\nor two gentlemen glanced at me occasionally, but none stared obtrusively: I\r\nsuppose if there was anything eccentric in the business, they accounted for it\r\nby this word \u201cAnglaise!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBreakfast over, I must again move\u2014in what direction? \u201cGo to Villette,\u201d said an\r\ninward voice; prompted doubtless by the recollection of this slight sentence\r\nuttered carelessly and at random by Miss Fanshawe, as she bid me good-by: \u201cI\r\nwish you would come to Madame Beck\u2019s; she has some marmots whom you might look\r\nafter; she wants an English gouvernante, or was wanting one two months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWho Madame Beck was, where she lived, I knew not; I had asked, but the question\r\npassed unheard: Miss Fanshawe, hurried away by her friends, left it unanswered.\r\nI presumed Villette to be her residence\u2014to Villette I would go. The distance\r\nwas forty miles. I knew I was catching at straws; but in the wide and weltering\r\ndeep where I found myself, I would have caught at cobwebs. Having inquired\r\nabout the means of travelling to Villette, and secured a seat in the diligence,\r\nI departed on the strength of this outline\u2014this shadow of a project. Before you\r\npronounce on the rashness of the proceeding, reader, look back to the point\r\nwhence I started; consider the desert I had left, note how little I perilled:\r\nmine was the game where the player cannot lose and may win.\r\n\n\r\nOf an artistic temperament, I deny that I am; yet I must possess something of\r\nthe artist\u2019s faculty of making the most of present pleasure: that is to say,\r\nwhen it is of the kind to my taste. I enjoyed that day, though we travelled\r\nslowly, though it was cold, though it rained. Somewhat bare, flat, and treeless\r\nwas the route along which our journey lay; and slimy canals crept, like\r\nhalf-torpid green snakes, beside the road; and formal pollard willows edged\r\nlevel fields, tilled like kitchen-garden beds. The sky, too, was monotonously\r\ngray; the atmosphere was stagnant and humid; yet amidst all these deadening\r\ninfluences, my fancy budded fresh and my heart basked in sunshine. These\r\nfeelings, however, were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless\r\nconsciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment, like a tiger crouched in a\r\njungle. The breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always; his fierce\r\nheart panted close against mine; he never stirred in his lair but I felt him: I\r\nknew he waited only for sun-down to bound ravenous from his ambush.\r\n\n\r\nI had hoped we might reach Villette ere night set in, and that thus I might\r\nescape the deeper embarrassment which obscurity seems to throw round a first\r\narrival at an unknown bourne; but, what with our slow progress and long\r\nstoppages\u2014what with a thick fog and small, dense rain\u2014darkness, that might\r\nalmost be felt, had settled on the city by the time we gained its suburbs.\r\n\n\r\nI know we passed through a gate where soldiers were stationed\u2014so much I could\r\nsee by lamplight; then, having left behind us the miry Chauss\u00e9e, we rattled\r\nover a pavement of strangely rough and flinty surface. At a bureau, the\r\ndiligence stopped, and the passengers alighted. My first business was to get my\r\ntrunk; a small matter enough, but important to me. Understanding that it was\r\nbest not to be importunate or over-eager about luggage, but to wait and watch\r\nquietly the delivery of other boxes till I saw my own, and then promptly claim\r\nand secure it, I stood apart; my eye fixed on that part of the vehicle in which\r\nI had seen my little portmanteau safely stowed, and upon which piles of\r\nadditional bags and boxes were now heaped. One by one, I saw these removed,\r\nlowered, and seized on.\r\n\n\r\nI was sure mine ought to be by this time visible: it was not. I had tied on the\r\ndirection-card with a piece of green ribbon, that I might know it at a glance:\r\nnot a fringe or fragment of green was perceptible. Every package was removed;\r\nevery tin-case and brown-paper parcel; the oilcloth cover was lifted; I saw\r\nwith distinct vision that not an umbrella, cloak, cane, hat-box or band-box\r\nremained.\r\n\n\r\nAnd my portmanteau, with my few clothes and little pocket-book enclasping the\r\nremnant of my fifteen pounds, where were they?\r\n\n\r\nI ask this question now, but I could not ask it then. I could say nothing\r\nwhatever; not possessing a phrase of speaking French: and it was French,\r\nand French only, the whole world seemed now gabbling around me. What\r\nshould I do? Approaching the conductor, I just laid my hand on his arm, pointed\r\nto a trunk, thence to the diligence-roof, and tried to express a question with\r\nmy eyes. He misunderstood me, seized the trunk indicated, and was about to\r\nhoist it on the vehicle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet that alone\u2014will you?\u201d said a voice in good English; then, in correction,\r\n\u201cQu\u2019est-ce que vous fa\u00eetes donc? Cette malle est \u00e0 moi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I had heard the Fatherland accents; they rejoiced my heart; I turned:\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, appealing to the stranger, without, in my distress, noticing\r\nwhat he was like, \u201cI cannot speak French. May I entreat you to ask this man\r\nwhat he has done with my trunk?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout discriminating, for the moment, what sort of face it was to which my\r\neyes were raised and on which they were fixed, I felt in its expression\r\nhalf-surprise at my appeal and half-doubt of the wisdom of interference.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo ask him; I would do as much for you,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know whether he smiled, but he said in a gentlemanly tone\u2014that is to\r\nsay, a tone not hard nor terrifying,\u2014\u201cWhat sort of trunk was yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI described it, including in my description the green ribbon. And forthwith he\r\ntook the conductor under hand, and I felt, through all the storm of French\r\nwhich followed, that he raked him fore and aft. Presently he returned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe fellow avers he was overloaded, and confesses that he removed your trunk\r\nafter you saw it put on, and has left it behind at Boue-Marine with other\r\nparcels; he has promised, however, to forward it to-morrow; the day after,\r\ntherefore, you will find it safe at this bureau.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said I: but my heart sank.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime what should I do? Perhaps this English gentleman saw the failure of\r\ncourage in my face; he inquired kindly, \u201cHave you any friends in this city?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere was a little pause, in the course of which, as he turned more fully to\r\nthe light of a lamp above him, I saw that he was a young, distinguished, and\r\nhandsome man; he might be a lord, for anything I knew: nature had made him good\r\nenough for a prince, I thought. His face was very pleasant; he looked high but\r\nnot arrogant, manly but not overbearing. I was turning away, in the deep\r\nconsciousness of all absence of claim to look for further help from such a one\r\nas he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas all your money in your trunk?\u201d he asked, stopping me.\r\n\n\r\nHow thankful was I to be able to answer with truth\u2014\u201cNo. I have enough in my\r\npurse\u201d (for I had near twenty francs) \u201cto keep me at a quiet inn till the day\r\nafter to-morrow; but I am quite a stranger in Villette, and don\u2019t know the\r\nstreets and the inns.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can give you the address of such an inn as you want,\u201d said he; \u201cand it is\r\nnot far off: with my direction you will easily find it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe tore a leaf from his pocket-book, wrote a few words and gave it to me. I\r\ndid think him kind; and as to distrusting him, or his advice, or his\r\naddress, I should almost as soon have thought of distrusting the Bible. There\r\nwas goodness in his countenance, and honour in his bright eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour shortest way will be to follow the Boulevard and cross the park,\u201d he\r\ncontinued; \u201cbut it is too late and too dark for a woman to go through the park\r\nalone; I will step with you thus far.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe moved on, and I followed him, through the darkness and the small soaking\r\nrain. The Boulevard was all deserted, its path miry, the water dripping from\r\nits trees; the park was black as midnight. In the double gloom of trees and\r\nfog, I could not see my guide; I could only follow his tread. Not the least\r\nfear had I: I believe I would have followed that frank tread, through continual\r\nnight, to the world\u2019s end.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, when the park was traversed, \u201cyou will go along this broad\r\nstreet till you come to steps; two lamps will show you where they are: these\r\nsteps you will descend: a narrower street lies below; following that, at the\r\nbottom you will find your inn. They speak English there, so your difficulties\r\nare now pretty well over. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, sir,\u201d said I: \u201caccept my sincerest thanks.\u201d And we parted.\r\n\n\r\nThe remembrance of his countenance, which I am sure wore a light not\r\nunbenignant to the friendless\u2014the sound in my ear of his voice, which spoke a\r\nnature chivalric to the needy and feeble, as well as the youthful and fair\u2014were\r\na sort of cordial to me long after. He was a true young English gentleman.\r\n\n\r\nOn I went, hurrying fast through a magnificent street and square, with the\r\ngrandest houses round, and amidst them the huge outline of more than one\r\noverbearing pile; which might be palace or church\u2014I could not tell. Just as I\r\npassed a portico, two mustachioed men came suddenly from behind the pillars;\r\nthey were smoking cigars: their dress implied pretensions to the rank of\r\ngentlemen, but, poor things! they were very plebeian in soul. They spoke with\r\ninsolence, and, fast as I walked, they kept pace with me a long way. At last I\r\nmet a sort of patrol, and my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit; but\r\nthey had driven me beyond my reckoning: when I could collect my faculties, I no\r\nlonger knew where I was; the staircase I must long since have passed. Puzzled,\r\nout of breath, all my pulses throbbing in inevitable agitation, I knew not\r\nwhere to turn. It was terrible to think of again encountering those bearded,\r\nsneering simpletons; yet the ground must be retraced, and the steps sought out.\r\n\n\r\nI came at last to an old and worn flight, and, taking it for granted that this\r\nmust be the one indicated, I descended them. The street into which they led was\r\nindeed narrow, but it contained no inn. On I wandered. In a very quiet and\r\ncomparatively clean and well-paved street, I saw a light burning over the door\r\nof a rather large house, loftier by a story than those round it. This\r\nmight be the inn at last. I hastened on: my knees now trembled under me: I was\r\ngetting quite exhausted.\r\n\n\r\nNo inn was this. A brass-plate embellished the great porte-coch\u00e8re: \u201cPensionnat\r\nde Demoiselles\u201d was the inscription; and beneath, a name, \u201cMadame Beck.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI started. About a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a moment. Yet I\r\nplanned nothing, and considered nothing: I had not time. Providence said, \u201cStop\r\nhere; this is your inn.\u201d Fate took me in her strong hand; mastered my\r\nwill; directed my actions: I rang the door-bell.\r\n\n\r\nWhile I waited, I would not reflect. I fixedly looked at the street-stones,\r\nwhere the door-lamp shone, and counted them and noted their shapes, and the\r\nglitter of wet on their angles. I rang again. They opened at last. A bonne in a\r\nsmart cap stood before me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay I see Madame Beck?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\nI believe if I had spoken French she would not have admitted me; but, as I\r\nspoke English, she concluded I was a foreign teacher come on business connected\r\nwith the pensionnat, and, even at that late hour, she let me in, without a word\r\nof reluctance, or a moment of hesitation.\r\n\n\r\nThe next moment I sat in a cold, glittering salon, with porcelain stove, unlit,\r\nand gilded ornaments, and polished floor. A pendule on the mantel-piece struck\r\nnine o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed. How fast beat every pulse in my frame! How I\r\nturned cold and hot by turns! I sat with my eyes fixed on the door\u2014a great\r\nwhite folding-door, with gilt mouldings: I watched to see a leaf move and open.\r\nAll had been quiet: not a mouse had stirred; the white doors were closed and\r\nmotionless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ayre Engliss?\u201d said a voice at my elbow. I almost bounded, so unexpected\r\nwas the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.\r\n\n\r\nNo ghost stood beside me, nor anything of spectral aspect; merely a motherly,\r\ndumpy little woman, in a large shawl, a wrapping-gown, and a clean, trim\r\nnightcap.\r\n\n\r\nI said I was English, and immediately, without further prelude, we fell to a\r\nmost remarkable conversation. Madame Beck (for Madame Beck it was\u2014she had\r\nentered by a little door behind me, and, being shod with the shoes of silence,\r\nI had heard neither her entrance nor approach)\u2014Madame Beck had exhausted her\r\ncommand of insular speech when she said, \u201cYou ayre Engliss,\u201d and she now\r\nproceeded to work away volubly in her own tongue. I answered in mine. She\r\npartly understood me, but as I did not at all understand her\u2014though we made\r\ntogether an awful clamour (anything like Madame\u2019s gift of utterance I had not\r\nhitherto heard or imagined)\u2014we achieved little progress. She rang, ere long,\r\nfor aid; which arrived in the shape of a \u201cma\u00eetresse,\u201d who had been partly\r\neducated in an Irish convent, and was esteemed a perfect adept in the English\r\nlanguage. A bluff little personage this ma\u00eetresse was\u2014Labassecourienne from top\r\nto toe: and how she did slaughter the speech of Albion! However, I told her a\r\nplain tale, which she translated. I told her how I had left my own country,\r\nintent on extending my knowledge, and gaining my bread; how I was ready to turn\r\nmy hand to any useful thing, provided it was not wrong or degrading; how I\r\nwould be a child\u2019s-nurse, or a lady\u2019s-maid, and would not refuse even housework\r\nadapted to my strength. Madame heard this; and, questioning her countenance, I\r\nalmost thought the tale won her ear:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIl n\u2019y a que les Anglaises pour ces sortes d\u2019entreprises,\u201d said she:\r\n\u201csont-elles donc intr\u00e9pides ces femmes l\u00e0!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe asked my name, my age; she sat and looked at me\u2014not pityingly, not with\r\ninterest: never a gleam of sympathy, or a shade of compassion, crossed her\r\ncountenance during the interview. I felt she was not one to be led an inch by\r\nher feelings: grave and considerate, she gazed, consulting her judgment and\r\nstudying my narrative. A bell rang.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 pour la pri\u00e8re du soir!\u201d said she, and rose. Through her interpreter,\r\nshe desired me to depart now, and come back on the morrow; but this did not\r\nsuit me: I could not bear to return to the perils of darkness and the street.\r\nWith energy, yet with a collected and controlled manner, I said, addressing\r\nherself personally, and not the ma\u00eetresse: \u201cBe assured, madame, that by\r\ninstantly securing my services, your interests will be served and not injured:\r\nyou will find me one who will wish to give, in her labour, a full equivalent\r\nfor her wages; and if you hire me, it will be better that I should stay here\r\nthis night: having no acquaintance in Villette, and not possessing the language\r\nof the country, how can I secure a lodging?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d said she; \u201cbut at least you can give a reference?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe inquired after my luggage: I told her when it would arrive. She mused. At\r\nthat moment a man\u2019s step was heard in the vestibule, hastily proceeding to the\r\nouter door. (I shall go on with this part of my tale as if I had understood all\r\nthat passed; for though it was then scarce intelligible to me, I heard it\r\ntranslated afterwards).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho goes out now?\u201d demanded Madame Beck, listening to the tread.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. Paul,\u201d replied the teacher. \u201cHe came this evening to give a reading to the\r\nfirst class.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe very man I should at this moment most wish to see. Call him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe teacher ran to the salon door. M. Paul was summoned. He entered: a small,\r\ndark and spare man, in spectacles.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon cousin,\u201d began Madame, \u201cI want your opinion. We know your skill in\r\nphysiognomy; use it now. Read that countenance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe little man fixed on me his spectacles: A resolute compression of the lips,\r\nand gathering of the brow, seemed to say that he meant to see through me, and\r\nthat a veil would be no veil for him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read it,\u201d he pronounced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt qu\u2019en dites vous?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais\u2014bien des choses,\u201d was the oracular answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBad or good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf each kind, without doubt,\u201d pursued the diviner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay one trust her word?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you negotiating a matter of importance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe wishes me to engage her as bonne or gouvernante; tells a tale full of\r\nintegrity, but gives no reference.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a stranger?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn Englishwoman, as one may see.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe speaks French?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a word.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe understands it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne may then speak plainly in her presence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe gazed steadily. \u201cDo you need her services?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could do with them. You know I am disgusted with Madame Svini.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill he scrutinized. The judgment, when it at last came, was as indefinite as\r\nwhat had gone before it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEngage her. If good predominates in that nature, the action will bring its own\r\nreward; if evil\u2014eh bien! ma cousine, ce sera toujours une bonne \u0153uvre.\u201d And\r\nwith a bow and a \u201cbon soir,\u201d this vague arbiter of my destiny vanished.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Madame did engage me that very night\u2014by God\u2019s blessing I was spared the\r\nnecessity of passing forth again into the lonesome, dreary, hostile street.\r\n\n"}
{"9": "\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nMADAME BECK.\n\r\nBeing delivered into the charge of the ma\u00eetresse, I was led through a long\r\nnarrow passage into a foreign kitchen, very clean but very strange. It seemed\r\nto contain no means of cooking\u2014neither fireplace nor oven; I did not understand\r\nthat the great black furnace which filled one corner, was an efficient\r\nsubstitute for these. Surely pride was not already beginning its whispers in my\r\nheart; yet I felt a sense of relief when, instead of being left in the kitchen,\r\nas I half anticipated, I was led forward to a small inner room termed a\r\n\u201ccabinet.\u201d A cook in a jacket, a short petticoat and sabots, brought my supper:\r\nto wit\u2014some meat, nature unknown, served in an odd and acid, but pleasant\r\nsauce; some chopped potatoes, made savoury with, I know not what: vinegar and\r\nsugar, I think: a tartine, or slice of bread and butter, and a baked pear.\r\nBeing hungry, I ate and was grateful.\r\n\n\r\nAfter the \u201cpri\u00e8re du soir,\u201d Madame herself came to have another look at me. She\r\ndesired me to follow her up-stairs. Through a series of the queerest little\r\ndormitories\u2014which, I heard afterwards, had once been nuns\u2019 cells: for the\r\npremises were in part of ancient date\u2014and through the oratory\u2014a long, low,\r\ngloomy room, where a crucifix hung, pale, against the wall, and two tapers kept\r\ndim vigils\u2014she conducted me to an apartment where three children were asleep in\r\nthree tiny beds. A heated stove made the air of this room oppressive; and, to\r\nmend matters, it was scented with an odour rather strong than delicate: a\r\nperfume, indeed, altogether surprising and unexpected under the circumstances,\r\nbeing like the combination of smoke with some spirituous essence\u2014a smell, in\r\nshort, of whisky.\r\n\n\r\nBeside a table, on which flared the remnant of a candle guttering to waste in\r\nthe socket, a coarse woman, heterogeneously clad in a broad striped showy silk\r\ndress, and a stuff apron, sat in a chair fast asleep. To complete the picture,\r\nand leave no doubt as to the state of matters, a bottle and an empty glass\r\nstood at the sleeping beauty\u2019s elbow.\r\n\n\r\nMadame contemplated this remarkable tableau with great calm; she neither smiled\r\nnor scowled; no impress of anger, disgust, or surprise, ruffled the equality of\r\nher grave aspect; she did not even wake the woman! Serenely pointing to a\r\nfourth bed, she intimated that it was to be mine; then, having extinguished the\r\ncandle and substituted for it a night-lamp, she glided through an inner door,\r\nwhich she left ajar\u2014the entrance to her own chamber, a large, well-furnished\r\napartment; as was discernible through the aperture.\r\n\n\r\nMy devotions that night were all thanksgiving. Strangely had I been led since\r\nmorning\u2014unexpectedly had I been provided for. Scarcely could I believe that not\r\nforty-eight hours had elapsed since I left London, under no other guardianship\r\nthan that which protects the passenger-bird\u2014with no prospect but the dubious\r\ncloud-tracery of hope.\r\n\n\r\nI was a light sleeper; in the dead of night I suddenly awoke. All was hushed,\r\nbut a white figure stood in the room\u2014Madame in her night-dress. Moving without\r\nperceptible sound, she visited the three children in the three beds; she\r\napproached me: I feigned sleep, and she studied me long. A small pantomime\r\nensued, curious enough. I daresay she sat a quarter of an hour on the edge of\r\nmy bed, gazing at my face. She then drew nearer, bent close over me; slightly\r\nraised my cap, and turned back the border so as to expose my hair; she looked\r\nat my hand lying on the bedclothes. This done, she turned to the chair where my\r\nclothes lay: it was at the foot of the bed. Hearing her touch and lift them, I\r\nopened my eyes with precaution, for I own I felt curious to see how far her\r\ntaste for research would lead her. It led her a good way: every article did she\r\ninspect. I divined her motive for this proceeding, viz. the wish to form from\r\nthe garments a judgment respecting the wearer, her station, means, neatness,\r\n&c. The end was not bad, but the means were hardly fair or justifiable. In\r\nmy dress was a pocket; she fairly turned it inside out: she counted the money\r\nin my purse; she opened a little memorandum-book, coolly perused its contents,\r\nand took from between the leaves a small plaited lock of Miss Marchmont\u2019s grey\r\nhair. To a bunch of three keys, being those of my trunk, desk, and work-box,\r\nshe accorded special attention: with these, indeed, she withdrew a moment to\r\nher own room. I softly rose in my bed and followed her with my eye: these keys,\r\nreader, were not brought back till they had left on the toilet of the adjoining\r\nroom the impress of their wards in wax. All being thus done decently and in\r\norder, my property was returned to its place, my clothes were carefully\r\nrefolded. Of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this scrutiny? Were\r\nthey favourable or otherwise? Vain question. Madame\u2019s face of stone (for of\r\nstone in its present night aspect it looked: it had been human, and, as I said\r\nbefore, motherly, in the salon) betrayed no response.\r\n\n\r\nHer duty done\u2014I felt that in her eyes this business was a duty\u2014she rose,\r\nnoiseless as a shadow: she moved towards her own chamber; at the door, she\r\nturned, fixing her eye on the heroine of the bottle, who still slept and loudly\r\nsnored. Mrs. Svini (I presume this was Mrs. Svini, Anglic\u00e9 or Hibernic\u00e9,\r\nSweeny)\u2014Mrs. Sweeny\u2019s doom was in Madame Beck\u2019s eye\u2014an immutable purpose that\r\neye spoke: Madame\u2019s visitations for shortcomings might be slow, but they were\r\nsure. All this was very un-English: truly I was in a foreign land.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow made me further acquainted with Mrs. Sweeny. It seems she had\r\nintroduced herself to her present employer as an English lady in reduced\r\ncircumstances: a native, indeed, of Middlesex, professing to speak the English\r\ntongue with the purest metropolitan accent. Madame\u2014reliant on her own\r\ninfallible expedients for finding out the truth in time\u2014had a singular\r\nintrepidity in hiring service off-hand (as indeed seemed abundantly proved in\r\nmy own case). She received Mrs. Sweeny as nursery-governess to her three\r\nchildren. I need hardly explain to the reader that this lady was in effect a\r\nnative of Ireland; her station I do not pretend to fix: she boldly declared\r\nthat she had \u201chad the bringing-up of the son and daughter of a marquis.\u201d I\r\nthink myself, she might possibly have been a hanger-on, nurse, fosterer, or\r\nwasherwoman, in some Irish family: she spoke a smothered tongue, curiously\r\noverlaid with mincing cockney inflections. By some means or other she had\r\nacquired, and now held in possession, a wardrobe of rather suspicious\r\nsplendour\u2014gowns of stiff and costly silk, fitting her indifferently, and\r\napparently made for other proportions than those they now adorned; caps with\r\nreal lace borders, and\u2014the chief item in the inventory, the spell by which she\r\nstruck a certain awe through the household, quelling the otherwise scornfully\r\ndisposed teachers and servants, and, so long as her broad shoulders wore\r\nthe folds of that majestic drapery, even influencing Madame herself\u2014a real\r\nIndian shawl\u2014\u201cun v\u00e9ritable cachemire,\u201d as Madame Beck said, with unmixed\r\nreverence and amaze. I feel quite sure that without this \u201ccachemire\u201d she would\r\nnot have kept her footing in the pensionnat for two days: by virtue of it, and\r\nit only, she maintained the same a month.\r\n\n\r\nBut when Mrs. Sweeny knew that I was come to fill her shoes, then it was that\r\nshe declared herself\u2014then did she rise on Madame Beck in her full power\u2014then\r\ncome down on me with her concentrated weight. Madame bore this revelation and\r\nvisitation so well, so stoically, that I for very shame could not support it\r\notherwise than with composure. For one little moment Madame Beck absented\r\nherself from the room; ten minutes after, an agent of the police stood in the\r\nmidst of us. Mrs. Sweeny and her effects were removed. Madame\u2019s brow had not\r\nbeen ruffled during the scene\u2014her lips had not dropped one sharply-accented\r\nword.\r\n\n\r\nThis brisk little affair of the dismissal was all settled before breakfast:\r\norder to march given, policeman called, mutineer expelled; \u201cchambre d\u2019enfans\u201d\r\nfumigated and cleansed, windows thrown open, and every trace of the\r\naccomplished Mrs. Sweeny\u2014even to the fine essence and spiritual fragrance which\r\ngave token so subtle and so fatal of the head and front of her offending\u2014was\r\nannihilated from the Rue Fossette: all this, I say, was done between the moment\r\nof Madame Beck\u2019s issuing like Aurora from her chamber, and that in which she\r\ncoolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.\r\n\n\r\nAbout noon, I was summoned to dress Madame. (It appeared my place was to be a\r\nhybrid between gouvernante and lady\u2019s-maid.) Till noon, she haunted the house\r\nin her wrapping-gown, shawl, and soundless slippers. How would the lady-chief\r\nof an English school approve this custom?\r\n\n\r\nThe dressing of her hair puzzled me; she had plenty of it: auburn, unmixed with\r\ngrey: though she was forty years old. Seeing my embarrassment, she said, \u201cYou\r\nhave not been a femme-de-chambre in your own country?\u201d And taking the brush\r\nfrom my hand, and setting me aside, not ungently or disrespectfully, she\r\narranged it herself. In performing other offices of the toilet, she\r\nhalf-directed, half-aided me, without the least display of temper or\r\nimpatience. N.B.\u2014That was the first and last time I was required to dress her.\r\nHenceforth, on Rosine, the portress, devolved that duty.\r\n\n\r\nWhen attired, Madame Beck appeared a personage of a figure rather short and\r\nstout, yet still graceful in its own peculiar way; that is, with the grace\r\nresulting from proportion of parts. Her complexion was fresh and sanguine, not\r\ntoo rubicund; her eye, blue and serene; her dark silk dress fitted her as a\r\nFrench sempstress alone can make a dress fit; she looked well, though a little\r\nbourgeoise; as bourgeoise, indeed, she was. I know not what of harmony pervaded\r\nher whole person; and yet her face offered contrast, too: its features were by\r\nno means such as are usually seen in conjunction with a complexion of such\r\nblended freshness and repose: their outline was stern: her forehead was high\r\nbut narrow; it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did\r\nher peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled in the heart\r\nor the softness which flows thence. Her mouth was hard: it could be a little\r\ngrim; her lips were thin. For sensibility and genius, with all their tenderness\r\nand temerity, I felt somehow that Madame would be the right sort of Minos in\r\npetticoats.\r\n\n\r\nIn the long run, I found she was something else in petticoats too. Her name was\r\nModeste Maria Beck, n\u00e9e Kint: it ought to have been Ignacia. She was a\r\ncharitable woman, and did a great deal of good. There never was a mistress\r\nwhose rule was milder. I was told that she never once remonstrated with the\r\nintolerable Mrs. Sweeny, despite her tipsiness, disorder, and general neglect;\r\nyet Mrs. Sweeny had to go the moment her departure became convenient. I was\r\ntold, too, that neither masters nor teachers were found fault with in that\r\nestablishment; yet both masters and teachers were often changed: they vanished\r\nand others filled their places, none could well explain how.\r\n\n\r\nThe establishment was both a pensionnat and an externat: the externes or\r\nday-pupils exceeded one hundred in number; the boarders were about a score.\r\nMadame must have possessed high administrative powers: she ruled all these,\r\ntogether with four teachers, eight masters, six servants, and three children,\r\nmanaging at the same time to perfection the pupils\u2019 parents and friends; and\r\nthat without apparent effort; without bustle, fatigue, fever, or any symptom of\r\nundue excitement: occupied she always was\u2014busy, rarely. It is true that Madame\r\nhad her own system for managing and regulating this mass of machinery; and a\r\nvery pretty system it was: the reader has seen a specimen of it, in that small\r\naffair of turning my pocket inside out, and reading my private memoranda.\r\n\u201cSurveillance,\u201d \u201cespionage,\u201d\u2014these were her watchwords.\r\n\n\r\nStill, Madame knew what honesty was, and liked it\u2014that is, when it did not\r\nobtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her will and interest. She had a\r\nrespect for \u201cAngleterre;\u201d and as to \u201cles Anglaises,\u201d she would have the women\r\nof no other country about her own children, if she could help it.\r\n\n\r\nOften in the evening, after she had been plotting and counter-plotting, spying\r\nand receiving the reports of spies all day, she would come up to my room\u2014a\r\ntrace of real weariness on her brow\u2014and she would sit down and listen while the\r\nchildren said their little prayers to me in English: the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and the\r\nhymn beginning \u201cGentle Jesus,\u201d these little Catholics were permitted to repeat\r\nat my knee; and, when I had put them to bed, she would talk to me (I soon\r\ngained enough French to be able to understand, and even answer her) about\r\nEngland and Englishwomen, and the reasons for what she was pleased to term\r\ntheir superior intelligence, and more real and reliable probity. Very good\r\nsense she often showed; very sound opinions she often broached: she seemed to\r\nknow that keeping girls in distrustful restraint, in blind ignorance, and under\r\na surveillance that left them no moment and no corner for retirement, was not\r\nthe best way to make them grow up honest and modest women; but she averred that\r\nruinous consequences would ensue if any other method were tried with\r\ncontinental children: they were so accustomed to restraint, that relaxation,\r\nhowever guarded, would be misunderstood and fatally presumed on. She was sick,\r\nshe would declare, of the means she had to use, but use them she must; and\r\nafter discoursing, often with dignity and delicacy, to me, she would move away\r\non her \u201csouliers de silence,\u201d and glide ghost-like through the house, watching\r\nand spying everywhere, peering through every keyhole, listening behind every\r\ndoor.\r\n\n\r\nAfter all, Madame\u2019s system was not bad\u2014let me do her justice. Nothing could be\r\nbetter than all her arrangements for the physical well-being of her scholars.\r\nNo minds were overtasked: the lessons were well distributed and made\r\nincomparably easy to the learner; there was a liberty of amusement, and a\r\nprovision for exercise which kept the girls healthy; the food was abundant and\r\ngood: neither pale nor puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette.\r\nShe never grudged a holiday; she allowed plenty of time for sleeping, dressing,\r\nwashing, eating; her method in all these matters was easy, liberal, salutary,\r\nand rational: many an austere English school-mistress would do vastly well to\r\nimitate her\u2014and I believe many would be glad to do so, if exacting English\r\nparents would let them.\r\n\n\r\nAs Madame Beck ruled by espionage, she of course had her staff of spies: she\r\nperfectly knew the quality of the tools she used, and while she would not\r\nscruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty occasion\u2014flinging this sort from her\r\nlike refuse rind, after the orange has been duly squeezed\u2014I have known her\r\nfastidious in seeking pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and\r\nrustless instrument was found, she was careful of the prize, keeping it in silk\r\nand cotton-wool. Yet, woe be to that man or woman who relied on her one inch\r\nbeyond the point where it was her interest to be trustworthy: interest was the\r\nmaster-key of Madame\u2019s nature\u2014the mainspring of her motives\u2014the alpha and omega\r\nof her life. I have seen her feelings appealed to, and I have smiled in\r\nhalf-pity, half-scorn at the appellants. None ever gained her ear through that\r\nchannel, or swayed her purpose by that means. On the contrary, to attempt to\r\ntouch her heart was the surest way to rouse her antipathy, and to make of her a\r\nsecret foe. It proved to her that she had no heart to be touched: it reminded\r\nher where she was impotent and dead. Never was the distinction between charity\r\nand mercy better exemplified than in her. While devoid of sympathy, she had a\r\nsufficiency of rational benevolence: she would give in the readiest manner to\r\npeople she had never seen\u2014rather, however, to classes than to individuals.\r\n\u201cPour les pauvres,\u201d she opened her purse freely\u2014against the poor man, as\r\na rule, she kept it closed. In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society\r\nat large she took a cheerful part; no private sorrow touched her: no force or\r\nmass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers. Not the\r\nagony in Gethsemane, not the death on Calvary, could have wrung from her eyes\r\none tear.\r\n\n\r\nI say again, Madame was a very great and a very capable woman. That school\r\noffered her for her powers too limited a sphere; she ought to have swayed a\r\nnation: she should have been the leader of a turbulent legislative assembly.\r\nNobody could have browbeaten her, none irritated her nerves, exhausted her\r\npatience, or over-reached her astuteness. In her own single person, she could\r\nhave comprised the duties of a first minister and a superintendent of police.\r\nWise, firm, faithless; secret, crafty, passionless; watchful and inscrutable;\r\nacute and insensate\u2014withal perfectly decorous\u2014what more could be desired?\r\n\n\r\nThe sensible reader will not suppose that I gained all the knowledge here\r\ncondensed for his benefit in one month, or in one half-year. No! what I saw at\r\nfirst was the thriving outside of a large and flourishing educational\r\nestablishment. Here was a great house, full of healthy, lively girls, all\r\nwell-dressed and many of them handsome, gaining knowledge by a marvellously\r\neasy method, without painful exertion or useless waste of spirits; not,\r\nperhaps, making very rapid progress in anything; taking it easy, but still\r\nalways employed, and never oppressed. Here was a corps of teachers and masters,\r\nmore stringently tasked, as all the real head-labour was to be done by them, in\r\norder to save the pupils, yet having their duties so arranged that they\r\nrelieved each other in quick succession whenever the work was severe: here, in\r\nshort, was a foreign school; of which the life, movement, and variety made it a\r\ncomplete and most charming contrast to many English institutions of the same\r\nkind.\r\n\n\r\nBehind the house was a large garden, and, in summer, the pupils almost lived\r\nout of doors amongst the rose-bushes and the fruit-trees. Under the vast and\r\nvine-draped berceau, Madame would take her seat on summer afternoons, and send\r\nfor the classes, in turns, to sit round her and sew and read. Meantime, masters\r\ncame and went, delivering short and lively lectures, rather than lessons, and\r\nthe pupils made notes of their instructions, or did not make them\u2014just\r\nas inclination prompted; secure that, in case of neglect, they could copy the\r\nnotes of their companions. Besides the regular monthly jours de sortie,\r\nthe Catholic f\u00eate-days brought a succession of holidays all the year round; and\r\nsometimes on a bright summer morning, or soft summer evening; the boarders were\r\ntaken out for a long walk into the country, regaled with gaufres and\r\nvin blanc, or new milk and pain bis, or pistolets au\r\nbeurre (rolls) and coffee. All this seemed very pleasant, and Madame\r\nappeared goodness itself; and the teachers not so bad but they might be worse;\r\nand the pupils, perhaps, a little noisy and rough, but types of health and\r\nglee.\r\n\n\r\nThus did the view appear, seen through the enchantment of distance; but there\r\ncame a time when distance was to melt for me\u2014when I was to be called down from\r\nmy watch-tower of the nursery, whence I had hitherto made my observations, and\r\nwas to be compelled into closer intercourse with this little world of the Rue\r\nFossette.\r\n\n\r\nI was one day sitting up-stairs, as usual, hearing the children their English\r\nlessons, and at the same time turning a silk dress for Madame, when she came\r\nsauntering into the room with that absorbed air and brow of hard thought she\r\nsometimes wore, and which made her look so little genial. Dropping into a seat\r\nopposite mine, she remained some minutes silent. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, the eldest girl, was\r\nreading to me some little essay of Mrs. Barbauld\u2019s, and I was making her\r\ntranslate currently from English to French as she proceeded, by way of\r\nascertaining that she comprehended what she read: Madame listened.\r\n\n\r\nPresently, without preface or prelude, she said, almost in the tone of one\r\nmaking an accusation, \u201cMeess, in England you were a governess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Madame,\u201d said I smiling, \u201cyou are mistaken.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs this your first essay at teaching\u2014this attempt with my children?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI assured her it was. Again she became silent; but looking up, as I took a pin\r\nfrom the cushion, I found myself an object of study: she held me under her eye;\r\nshe seemed turning me round in her thoughts\u2014measuring my fitness for a purpose,\r\nweighing my value in a plan. Madame had, ere this, scrutinized all I had, and I\r\nbelieve she esteemed herself cognizant of much that I was; but from that day,\r\nfor the space of about a fortnight, she tried me by new tests. She listened at\r\nthe nursery door when I was shut in with the children; she followed me at a\r\ncautious distance when I walked out with them, stealing within ear-shot\r\nwhenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient screen: a strict\r\npreliminary process having thus been observed, she made a move forward.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning, coming on me abruptly, and with the semblance of hurry, she said\r\nshe found herself placed in a little dilemma. Mr. Wilson, the English master,\r\nhad failed to come at his hour, she feared he was ill; the pupils were waiting\r\nin classe; there was no one to give a lesson; should I, for once, object to\r\ngiving a short dictation exercise, just that the pupils might not have it to\r\nsay they had missed their English lesson?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn classe, Madame?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, in classe: in the second division.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere there are sixty pupils,\u201d said I; for I knew the number, and with my\r\nusual base habit of cowardice, I shrank into my sloth like a snail into its\r\nshell, and alleged incapacity and impracticability as a pretext to escape\r\naction. If left to myself, I should infallibly have let this chance slip.\r\nInadventurous, unstirred by impulses of practical ambition, I was capable of\r\nsitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook, turning silk dresses and\r\nmaking children\u2019s frocks. Not that true contentment dignified this infatuated\r\nresignation: my work had neither charm for my taste, nor hold on my interest;\r\nbut it seemed to me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety, and relieved\r\nfrom intimate trial: the negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach\r\nto happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives\u2014the life\r\nof thought, and that of reality; and, provided the former was nourished with a\r\nsufficiency of the strange necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the\r\nlatter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work, and a roof of shelter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Madame, as I stooped more busily than ever over the cutting-out of\r\na child\u2019s pinafore, \u201cleave that work.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Fifine wants it, Madame.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFifine must want it, then, for I want you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd as Madame Beck did really want and was resolved to have me\u2014as she had long\r\nbeen dissatisfied with the English master, with his shortcomings in\r\npunctuality, and his careless method of tuition\u2014as, too, she did not\r\nlack resolution and practical activity, whether I lacked them or\r\nnot\u2014she, without more ado, made me relinquish thimble and needle; my hand was\r\ntaken into hers, and I was conducted down-stairs. When we reached the carr\u00e9, a\r\nlarge square hall between the dwelling-house and the pensionnat, she paused,\r\ndropped my hand, faced, and scrutinized me. I was flushed, and tremulous from\r\nhead to foot: tell it not in Gath, I believe I was crying. In fact, the\r\ndifficulties before me were far from being wholly imaginary; some of them were\r\nreal enough; and not the least substantial lay in my want of mastery over the\r\nmedium through which I should be obliged to teach. I had, indeed, studied\r\nFrench closely since my arrival in Villette; learning its practice by day, and\r\nits theory in every leisure moment at night, to as late an hour as the rule of\r\nthe house would allow candle-light; but I was far from yet being able to trust\r\nmy powers of correct oral expression.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00eetes donc,\u201d said Madame sternly, \u201cvous sentez vous r\u00e9ellement trop faible?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI might have said \u201cYes,\u201d and gone back to nursery obscurity, and there,\r\nperhaps, mouldered for the rest of my life; but looking up at Madame, I saw in\r\nher countenance a something that made me think twice ere I decided. At that\r\ninstant she did not wear a woman\u2019s aspect, but rather a man\u2019s. Power of a\r\nparticular kind strongly limned itself in all her traits, and that power was\r\nnot my kind of power: neither sympathy, nor congeniality, nor submission, were\r\nthe emotions it awakened. I stood\u2014not soothed, nor won, nor overwhelmed. It\r\nseemed as if a challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given, and I\r\nsuddenly felt all the dishonour of my diffidence\u2014all the pusillanimity of my\r\nslackness to aspire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you,\u201d she said, \u201cgo backward or forward?\u201d indicating with her hand,\r\nfirst, the small door of communication with the dwelling-house, and then the\r\ngreat double portals of the classes or schoolrooms.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEn avant,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d pursued she, cooling as I warmed, and continuing the hard look, from\r\nvery antipathy to which I drew strength and determination, \u201ccan you face the\r\nclasses, or are you over-excited?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe sneered slightly in saying this: nervous excitability was not much to\r\nMadame\u2019s taste.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no more excited than this stone,\u201d I said, tapping the flag with my toe:\r\n\u201cor than you,\u201d I added, returning her look.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! But let me tell you these are not quiet, decorous, English girls you are\r\ngoing to encounter. Ce sont des Labassecouriennes, rondes, franches, brusques,\r\net tant soit peu rebelles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said: \u201cI know; and I know, too, that though I have studied French hard since\r\nI came here, yet I still speak it with far too much hesitation\u2014too little\r\naccuracy to be able to command their respect I shall make blunders that will\r\nlay me open to the scorn of the most ignorant. Still I mean to give the\r\nlesson.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey always throw over timid teachers,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know that too, Madame; I have heard how they rebelled against and persecuted\r\nMiss Turner\u201d\u2014a poor friendless English teacher, whom Madame had employed, and\r\nlightly discarded; and to whose piteous history I was no stranger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est vrai,\u201d said she, coolly. \u201cMiss Turner had no more command over them than\r\na servant from the kitchen would have had. She was weak and wavering; she had\r\nneither tact nor intelligence, decision nor dignity. Miss Turner would not do\r\nfor these girls at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI made no reply, but advanced to the closed schoolroom door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not expect aid from me, or from any one,\u201d said Madame. \u201cThat would at\r\nonce set you down as incompetent for your office.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI opened the door, let her pass with courtesy, and followed her. There were\r\nthree schoolrooms, all large. That dedicated to the second division, where I\r\nwas to figure, was considerably the largest, and accommodated an assemblage\r\nmore numerous, more turbulent, and infinitely more unmanageable than the other\r\ntwo. In after days, when I knew the ground better, I used to think sometimes\r\n(if such a comparison may be permitted), that the quiet, polished, tame first\r\ndivision was to the robust, riotous, demonstrative second division, what the\r\nEnglish House of Lords is to the House of Commons.\r\n\n\r\nThe first glance informed me that many of the pupils were more than girls\u2014quite\r\nyoung women; I knew that some of them were of noble family (as nobility goes in\r\nLabassecour), and I was well convinced that not one amongst them was ignorant\r\nof my position in Madame\u2019s household. As I mounted the estr\u00e0de (a low platform,\r\nraised a step above the flooring), where stood the teacher\u2019s chair and desk, I\r\nbeheld opposite to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy\r\nweather\u2014eyes full of an insolent light, and brows hard and unblushing as\r\nmarble. The continental \u201cfemale\u201d is quite a different being to the insular\r\n\u201cfemale\u201d of the same age and class: I never saw such eyes and brows in England.\r\nMadame Beck introduced me in one cool phrase, sailed from the room, and left me\r\nalone in my glory.\r\n\n\r\nI shall never forget that first lesson, nor all the under-current of life and\r\ncharacter it opened up to me. Then first did I begin rightly to see the wide\r\ndifference that lies between the novelist\u2019s and poet\u2019s ideal \u201cjeune fille\u201d and\r\nthe said \u201cjeune fille\u201d as she really is.\r\n\n\r\nIt seems that three titled belles in the first row had sat down predetermined\r\nthat a bonne d\u2019enfants should not give them lessons in English. They\r\nknew they had succeeded in expelling obnoxious teachers before now; they knew\r\nthat Madame would at any time throw overboard a professeur or maitresse who\r\nbecame unpopular with the school\u2014that she never assisted a weak official to\r\nretain his place\u2014that if he had not strength to fight, or tact to win his way,\r\ndown he went: looking at \u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d they promised themselves an easy\r\nvictory.\r\n\n\r\nMesdemoiselles Blanche, Virginie, and Ang\u00e9lique opened the campaign by a series\r\nof titterings and whisperings; these soon swelled into murmurs and short\r\nlaughs, which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more loudly. This\r\ngrowing revolt of sixty against one, soon became oppressive enough; my command\r\nof French being so limited, and exercised under such cruel constraint.\r\n\n\r\nCould I but have spoken in my own tongue, I felt as if I might have gained a\r\nhearing; for, in the first place, though I knew I looked a poor creature, and\r\nin many respects actually was so, yet nature had given me a voice that could\r\nmake itself heard, if lifted in excitement or deepened by emotion. In the\r\nsecond place, while I had no flow, only a hesitating trickle of language, in\r\nordinary circumstances, yet\u2014under stimulus such as was now rife through the\r\nmutinous mass\u2014I could, in English, have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing\r\ntheir proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized; and then with\r\nsome sarcasm, flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders, and\r\nrelieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish followers, it seemed\r\nto me that one might possibly get command over this wild herd, and bring them\r\ninto training, at least. All I could now do was to walk up to\r\nBlanche\u2014Mademoiselle de Melcy, a young baronne\u2014the eldest, tallest, handsomest,\r\nand most vicious\u2014stand before her desk, take from under her hand her\r\nexercise-book, remount the estrade, deliberately read the composition, which I\r\nfound very stupid, and, as deliberately, and in the face of the whole school,\r\ntear the blotted page in two.\r\n\n\r\nThis action availed to draw attention and check noise. One girl alone, quite in\r\nthe background, persevered in the riot with undiminished energy. I looked at\r\nher attentively. She had a pale face, hair like night, broad strong eyebrows,\r\ndecided features, and a dark, mutinous, sinister eye: I noted that she sat\r\nclose by a little door, which door, I was well aware, opened into a small\r\ncloset where books were kept. She was standing up for the purpose of conducting\r\nher clamour with freer energies. I measured her stature and calculated her\r\nstrength. She seemed both tall and wiry; but, so the conflict were brief and\r\nthe attack unexpected, I thought I might manage her.\r\n\n\r\nAdvancing up the room, looking as cool and careless as I possibly could, in\r\nshort, ayant l\u2019air de rien, I slightly pushed the door and found it was\r\najar. In an instant, and with sharpness, I had turned on her. In another\r\ninstant she occupied the closet, the door was shut, and the key in my pocket.\r\n\n\r\nIt so happened that this girl, Dolores by name, and a Catalonian by race, was\r\nthe sort of character at once dreaded and hated by all her associates; the act\r\nof summary justice above noted proved popular: there was not one present but,\r\nin her heart, liked to see it done. They were stilled for a moment; then a\r\nsmile\u2014not a laugh\u2014passed from desk to desk: then\u2014when I had gravely and\r\ntranquilly returned to the estrade, courteously requested silence, and\r\ncommenced a dictation as if nothing at all had happened\u2014the pens travelled\r\npeacefully over the pages, and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and\r\nindustry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est bien,\u201d said Madame Beck, when I came out of class, hot and a little\r\nexhausted. \u201cCa ira.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe had been listening and peeping through a spy-hole the whole time.\r\n\n\r\nFrom that day I ceased to be nursery governess, and became English teacher.\r\nMadame raised my salary; but she got thrice the work out of me she had\r\nextracted from Mr. Wilson, at half the expense.\r\n\n"}
{"10": "\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nISIDORE.\n\r\nMy time was now well and profitably filled up. What with teaching others and\r\nstudying closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment. It was pleasant. I felt I\r\nwas getting on; not lying the stagnant prey of mould and rust, but polishing\r\nmy faculties and whetting them to a keen edge with constant use. Experience of\r\na certain kind lay before me, on no narrow scale. Villette is a cosmopolitan\r\ncity, and in this school were girls of almost every European nation, and\r\nlikewise of very varied rank in life. Equality is much practised in\r\nLabassecour; though not republican in form, it is nearly so in substance, and\r\nat the desks of Madame Beck\u2019s establishment the young countess and the young\r\nbourgeoise sat side by side. Nor could you always by outward indications decide\r\nwhich was noble and which plebeian; except that, indeed, the latter had often\r\nfranker and more courteous manners, while the former bore away the bell for a\r\ndelicately-balanced combination of insolence and deceit. In the former there\r\nwas often quick French blood mixed with the marsh-phlegm: I regret to say that\r\nthe effect of this vivacious fluid chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with\r\nwhich flattery and fiction ran from the tongue, and in a manner lighter and\r\nlivelier, but quite heartless and insincere.\r\n\n\r\nTo do all parties justice, the honest aboriginal Labassecouriennes had an\r\nhypocrisy of their own, too; but it was of a coarse order, such as could\r\ndeceive few. Whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions, they brought it\r\nout with a careless ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of\r\nconscience. Not a soul in Madame Beck\u2019s house, from the scullion to the\r\ndirectress herself, but was above being ashamed of a lie; they thought nothing\r\nof it: to invent might not be precisely a virtue, but it was the most venial of\r\nfaults. \u201cJ\u2019ai menti plusieurs fois,\u201d formed an item of every girl\u2019s and woman\u2019s\r\nmonthly confession: the priest heard unshocked, and absolved unreluctant. If\r\nthey had missed going to mass, or read a chapter of a novel, that was another\r\nthing: these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the unfailing weed.\r\n\n\r\nWhile yet but half-conscious of this state of things, and unlearned in its\r\nresults, I got on in my new sphere very well. After the first few difficult\r\nlessons, given amidst peril and on the edge of a moral volcano that rumbled\r\nunder my feet and sent sparks and hot fumes into my eyes, the eruptive spirit\r\nseemed to subside, as far as I was concerned. My mind was a good deal bent on\r\nsuccess: I could not bear the thought of being baffled by mere undisciplined\r\ndisaffection and wanton indocility, in this first attempt to get on in life.\r\nMany hours of the night I used to lie awake, thinking what plan I had best\r\nadopt to get a reliable hold on these mutineers, to bring this stiff-necked\r\ntribe under permanent influence. In the first place, I saw plainly that aid in\r\nno shape was to be expected from Madame: her righteous plan was to maintain an\r\nunbroken popularity with the pupils, at any and every cost of justice or\r\ncomfort to the teachers. For a teacher to seek her alliance in any crisis of\r\ninsubordination was equivalent to securing her own expulsion. In intercourse\r\nwith her pupils, Madame only took to herself what was pleasant, amiable, and\r\nrecommendatory; rigidly requiring of her lieutenants sufficiency for every\r\nannoying crisis, where to act with adequate promptitude was to be unpopular.\r\nThus, I must look only to myself.\r\n\n\r\nImprimis\u2014it was clear as the day that this swinish multitude were not to be\r\ndriven by force. They were to be humoured, borne with very patiently: a\r\ncourteous though sedate manner impressed them; a very rare flash of raillery\r\ndid good. Severe or continuous mental application they could not, or would not,\r\nbear: heavy demand on the memory, the reason, the attention, they rejected\r\npoint-blank. Where an English girl of not more than average capacity and\r\ndocility would quietly take a theme and bind herself to the task of\r\ncomprehension and mastery, a Labassecourienne would laugh in your face, and\r\nthrow it back to you with the phrase,\u2014\u201cDieu, que c\u2019est difficile! Je n\u2019en veux\r\npas. Cela m\u2019ennuie trop.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA teacher who understood her business would take it back at once, without\r\nhesitation, contest, or expostulation\u2014proceed with even exaggerated care to\r\nsmoothe every difficulty, to reduce it to the level of their understandings,\r\nreturn it to them thus modified, and lay on the lash of sarcasm with unsparing\r\nhand. They would feel the sting, perhaps wince a little under it; but they bore\r\nno malice against this sort of attack, provided the sneer was not sour,\r\nbut hearty, and that it held well up to them, in a clear, light, and\r\nbold type, so that she who ran might read, their incapacity, ignorance, and\r\nsloth. They would riot for three additional lines to a lesson; but I never knew\r\nthem rebel against a wound given to their self-respect: the little they had of\r\nthat quality was trained to be crushed, and it rather liked the pressure of a\r\nfirm heel than otherwise.\r\n\n\r\nBy degrees, as I acquired fluency and freedom in their language, and could make\r\nsuch application of its more nervous idioms as suited their case, the elder and\r\nmore intelligent girls began rather to like me in their way: I noticed that\r\nwhenever a pupil had been roused to feel in her soul the stirring of worthy\r\nemulation, or the quickening of honest shame, from that date she was won. If I\r\ncould but once make their (usually large) ears burn under their thick glossy\r\nhair, all was comparatively well. By-and-by bouquets began to be laid on my\r\ndesk in the morning; by way of acknowledgment for this little foreign\r\nattention, I used sometimes to walk with a select few during recreation. In the\r\ncourse of conversation it befel once or twice that I made an unpremeditated\r\nattempt to rectify some of their singularly distorted notions of principle;\r\nespecially I expressed my ideas of the evil and baseness of a lie. In an\r\nunguarded moment, I chanced to say that, of the two errors; I considered\r\nfalsehood worse than an occasional lapse in church-attendance. The poor girls\r\nwere tutored to report in Catholic ears whatever the Protestant teacher said.\r\nAn edifying consequence ensued. Something\u2014an unseen, an indefinite, a\r\nnameless\u2014something stole between myself and these my best pupils: the bouquets\r\ncontinued to be offered, but conversation thenceforth became impracticable. As\r\nI paced the alleys or sat in the berceau, a girl never came to my right hand\r\nbut a teacher, as if by magic, appeared at my left. Also, wonderful to relate,\r\nMadame\u2019s shoes of silence brought her continually to my back, as quick, as\r\nnoiseless and unexpected, as some wandering zephyr.\r\n\n\r\nThe opinion of my Catholic acquaintance concerning my spiritual prospects was\r\nsomewhat na\u00efvely expressed to me on one occasion. A pensionnaire, to whom I had\r\nrendered some little service, exclaimed one day as she sat beside me:\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, what a pity you are a Protestant!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Isabelle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cParceque, quand vous serez morte\u2014vous br\u00fblerez tout de suite dans l\u2019Enfer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCroyez-vous?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainement que j\u2019y crois: tout le monde le sait; et d\u2019ailleurs le pr\u00eatre me\r\nl\u2019a dit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIsabelle was an odd, blunt little creature. She added, sotto voce: \u201cPour\r\nassurer votre salut l\u00e0-haut, on ferait bien de vous br\u00fbler toute vive ici-bas.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed, as, indeed, it was impossible to do otherwise.\r\n\n\r\nHas the reader forgotten Miss Ginevra Fanshawe? If so, I must be allowed to\r\nre-introduce that young lady as a thriving pupil of Madame Beck\u2019s; for such she\r\nwas. On her arrival in the Rue Fossette, two or three days after my sudden\r\nsettlement there, she encountered me with very little surprise. She must have\r\nhad good blood in her veins, for never was any duchess more perfectly,\r\nradically, unaffectedly nonchalante than she: a weak, transient amaze\r\nwas all she knew of the sensation of wonder. Most of her other faculties seemed\r\nto be in the same flimsy condition: her liking and disliking, her love and\r\nhate, were mere cobweb and gossamer; but she had one thing about her that\r\nseemed strong and durable enough, and that was\u2014her selfishness.\r\n\n\r\nShe was not proud; and\u2014bonne d\u2019enfants as I was\u2014she would forthwith have\r\nmade of me a sort of friend and confidant. She teased me with a thousand vapid\r\ncomplaints about school-quarrels and household economy: the cookery was not to\r\nher taste; the people about her, teachers and pupils, she held to be\r\ndespicable, because they were foreigners. I bore with her abuse of the Friday\u2019s\r\nsalt fish and hard eggs\u2014with her invective against the soup, the bread, the\r\ncoffee\u2014with some patience for a time; but at last, wearied by iteration, I\r\nturned crusty, and put her to rights: a thing I ought to have done in the very\r\nbeginning, for a salutary setting down always agreed with her.\r\n\n\r\nMuch longer had I to endure her demands on me in the way of work. Her wardrobe,\r\nso far as concerned articles of external wear, was well and elegantly supplied;\r\nbut there were other habiliments not so carefully provided: what she had,\r\nneeded frequent repair. She hated needle-drudgery herself, and she would bring\r\nher hose, &c. to me in heaps, to be mended. A compliance of some weeks\r\nthreatening to result in the establishment of an intolerable bore\u2014I at last\r\ndistinctly told her she must make up her mind to mend her own garments. She\r\ncried on receiving this information, and accused me of having ceased to be her\r\nfriend; but I held by my decision, and let the hysterics pass as they could.\r\n\n\r\nNotwithstanding these foibles, and various others needless to mention\u2014but by no\r\nmeans of a refined or elevating character\u2014how pretty she was! How charming she\r\nlooked, when she came down on a sunny Sunday morning, well-dressed and\r\nwell-humoured, robed in pale lilac silk, and with her fair long curls reposing\r\non her white shoulders. Sunday was a holiday which she always passed with\r\nfriends resident in town; and amongst these friends she speedily gave me to\r\nunderstand was one who would fain become something more. By glimpses and hints\r\nit was shown me, and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was ere\r\nlong proved, that ardent admiration\u2014perhaps genuine love\u2014was at her command.\r\nShe called her suitor \u201cIsidore:\u201d this, however, she intimated was not his real\r\nname, but one by which it pleased her to baptize him\u2014his own, she hinted, not\r\nbeing \u201cvery pretty.\u201d Once, when she had been bragging about the vehemence of\r\n\u201cIsidore\u2019s\u201d attachment, I asked if she loved him in return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComme cela,\u201d said she: \u201che is handsome, and he loves me to distraction, so\r\nthat I am well amused. Ca suffit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFinding that she carried the thing on longer than, from her very fickle tastes,\r\nI had anticipated, I one day took it upon me to make serious inquiries as to\r\nwhether the gentleman was such as her parents, and especially her uncle\u2014on\r\nwhom, it appeared, she was dependent\u2014would be likely to approve. She allowed\r\nthat this was very doubtful, as she did not believe \u201cIsidore\u201d had much money.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you encourage him?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFurieusement sometimes,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWithout being certain that you will be permitted to marry him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, how dowdyish you are! I don\u2019t want to be married. I am too young.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if he loves you as much as you say, and yet it comes to nothing in the\r\nend, he will be made miserable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course he will break his heart. I should be shocked and, disappointed if he\r\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder whether this M. Isidore is a fool?\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is, about me; but he is wise in other things, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on dit. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley considers him extremely clever: she says he will push his way by\r\nhis talents; all I know is, that he does little more than sigh in my presence,\r\nand that I can wind him round my little finger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWishing to get a more definite idea of this love-stricken M. Isidore; whose\r\nposition seemed to me of the least secure, I requested her to favour me with a\r\npersonal description; but she could not describe: she had neither words nor the\r\npower of putting them together so as to make graphic phrases. She even seemed\r\nnot properly to have noticed him: nothing of his looks, of the changes in his\r\ncountenance, had touched her heart or dwelt in her memory\u2014that he was \u201cbeau,\r\nmais plut\u00f4t bel homme que joli gar\u00e7on,\u201d was all she could assert. My patience\r\nwould often have failed, and my interest flagged, in listening to her, but for\r\none thing. All the hints she dropped, all the details she gave, went\r\nunconsciously to prove, to my thinking, that M. Isidore\u2019s homage was offered\r\nwith great delicacy and respect. I informed her very plainly that I believed\r\nhim much too good for her, and intimated with equal plainness my impression\r\nthat she was but a vain coquette. She laughed, shook her curls from her eyes,\r\nand danced away as if I had paid her a compliment.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Ginevra\u2019s school-studies were little better than nominal; there were but\r\nthree things she practised in earnest, viz. music, singing, and dancing; also\r\nembroidering the fine cambric handkerchiefs which she could not afford to buy\r\nready worked: such mere trifles as lessons in history, geography, grammar, and\r\narithmetic, she left undone, or got others to do for her. Very much of her time\r\nwas spent in visiting. Madame, aware that her stay at school was now limited to\r\na certain period, which would not be extended whether she made progress or not,\r\nallowed her great licence in this particular. Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2014her\r\nchaperon\u2014a gay, fashionable lady, invited her whenever she had company\r\nat her own house, and sometimes took her to evening-parties at the houses of\r\nher acquaintance. Ginevra perfectly approved this mode of procedure: it had but\r\none inconvenience; she was obliged to be well dressed, and she had not money to\r\nbuy variety of dresses. All her thoughts turned on this difficulty; her whole\r\nsoul was occupied with expedients for effecting its solution. It was wonderful\r\nto witness the activity of her otherwise indolent mind on this point, and to\r\nsee the much-daring intrepidity to which she was spurred by a sense of\r\nnecessity, and the wish to shine.\r\n\n\r\nShe begged boldly of Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2014boldly, I say: not with an air of\r\nreluctant shame, but in this strain:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy darling Mrs. C., I have nothing in the world fit to wear for your party\r\nnext week; you must give me a book-muslin dress, and then a ceinture\r\nbleu celeste: do\u2014there\u2019s an angel! will you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe \u201cdarling Mrs. C.\u201d yielded at first; but finding that applications increased\r\nas they were complied with, she was soon obliged, like all Miss Fanshawe\u2019s\r\nfriends, to oppose resistance to encroachment. After a while I heard no more of\r\nMrs. Cholmondeley\u2019s presents; but still, visiting went on, and the absolutely\r\nnecessary dresses continued to be supplied: also many little expensive\r\netcetera\u2014gloves, bouquets, even trinkets. These things, contrary to her\r\ncustom, and even nature\u2014for she was not secretive\u2014were most sedulously kept out\r\nof sight for a time; but one evening, when she was going to a large party for\r\nwhich particular care and elegance of costume were demanded, she could not\r\nresist coming to my chamber to show herself in all her splendour.\r\n\n\r\nBeautiful she looked: so young, so fresh, and with a delicacy of skin and\r\nflexibility of shape altogether English, and not found in the list of\r\ncontinental female charms. Her dress was new, costly, and perfect. I saw at a\r\nglance that it lacked none of those finishing details which cost so much, and\r\ngive to the general effect such an air of tasteful completeness.\r\n\n\r\nI viewed her from top to toe. She turned airily round that I might survey her\r\non all sides. Conscious of her charms, she was in her best humour: her rather\r\nsmall blue eyes sparkled gleefully. She was going to bestow on me a kiss, in\r\nher school-girl fashion of showing her delights but I said, \u201cSteady! Let us be\r\nSteady, and know what we are about, and find out the meaning of our\r\nmagnificence\u201d\u2014and so put her off at arm\u2019s length, to undergo cooler inspection.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I do?\u201d was her question.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo?\u201d said I. \u201cThere are different ways of doing; and, by my word, I don\u2019t\r\nunderstand yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how do I look?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look well dressed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe thought the praise not warm enough, and proceeded to direct attention to\r\nthe various decorative points of her attire. \u201cLook at this parure,\u201d said\r\nshe. \u201cThe brooch, the ear-rings, the bracelets: no one in the school has such a\r\nset\u2014not Madame herself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see them all.\u201d (Pause.) \u201cDid M. de Bassompierre give you those jewels?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle knows nothing about them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere they presents from Mrs. Cholmondeley?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot they, indeed. Mrs. Cholmondeley is a mean, stingy creature; she never\r\ngives me anything now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not choose to ask any further questions, but turned abruptly away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, old Crusty\u2014old Diogenes\u201d (these were her familiar terms for me when we\r\ndisagreed), \u201cwhat is the matter now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake yourself away. I have no pleasure in looking at you or your\r\nparure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor an instant, she seemed taken by surprise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now, Mother Wisdom? I have not got into debt for it\u2014that is, not for the\r\njewels, nor the gloves, nor the bouquet. My dress is certainly not paid for,\r\nbut uncle de Bassompierre will pay it in the bill: he never notices items, but\r\njust looks at the total; and he is so rich, one need not care about a few\r\nguineas more or less.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you go? I want to shut the door\u2026. Ginevra, people may tell you you are\r\nvery handsome in that ball-attire; but, in my eyes, you will never look\r\nso pretty as you did in the gingham gown and plain straw bonnet you wore when I\r\nfirst saw you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOther people have not your puritanical tastes,\u201d was her angry reply. \u201cAnd,\r\nbesides, I see no right you have to sermonize me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly! I have little right; and you, perhaps, have still less to come\r\nflourishing and fluttering into my chamber\u2014a mere jay in borrowed plumes. I\r\nhave not the least respect for your feathers, Miss Fanshawe; and especially the\r\npeacock\u2019s eyes you call a parure: very pretty things, if you had bought\r\nthem with money which was your own, and which you could well spare, but not at\r\nall pretty under present circumstances.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn est l\u00e0 pour Mademoiselle Fanshawe!\u201d was announced by the portress, and away\r\nshe tripped.\r\n\n\r\nThis semi-mystery of the parure was not solved till two or three days\r\nafterwards, when she came to make a voluntary confession.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need not be sulky with me,\u201d she began, \u201cin the idea that I am running\r\nsomebody, papa or M. de Bassompierre, deeply into debt. I assure you nothing\r\nremains unpaid for, but the few dresses I have lately had: all the rest is\r\nsettled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d I thought, \u201clies the mystery; considering that they were not given you\r\nby Mrs. Cholmondeley, and that your own means are limited to a few shillings,\r\nof which I know you to be excessively careful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEcoutez!\u201d she went on, drawing near and speaking in her most confidential and\r\ncoaxing tone; for my \u201csulkiness\u201d was inconvenient to her: she liked me to be in\r\na talking and listening mood, even if I only talked to chide and listened to\r\nrail. \u201cEcoutez, ch\u00e8re grogneuse! I will tell you all how and about it; and you\r\nwill then see, not only how right the whole thing is, but how cleverly managed.\r\nIn the first place, I must go out. Papa himself said that he wished me\r\nto see something of the world; he particularly remarked to Mrs. Cholmondeley,\r\nthat, though I was a sweet creature enough, I had rather a\r\nbread-and-butter-eating, school-girl air; of which it was his special desire\r\nthat I should get rid, by an introduction to society here, before I make my\r\nregular d\u00e9but in England. Well, then, if I go out, I must dress. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley is turned shabby, and will give nothing more; it would be too hard\r\nupon uncle to make him pay for all the things I need: that you\r\ncan\u2019t deny\u2014that agrees with your own preachments. Well, but SOMEBODY who\r\nheard me (quite by chance, I assure you) complaining to Mrs. Cholmondeley of my\r\ndistressed circumstances, and what straits I was put to for an ornament or\r\ntwo\u2014somebody, far from grudging one a present, was quite delighted at\r\nthe idea of being permitted to offer some trifle. You should have seen what a\r\nblanc-bec he looked when he first spoke of it: how he hesitated and\r\nblushed, and positively trembled from fear of a repulse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Miss Fanshawe. I suppose I am to understand that M. Isidore is\r\nthe benefactor: that it is from him you have accepted that costly\r\nparure; that he supplies your bouquets and your gloves?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou express yourself so disagreeably,\u201d said she, \u201cone hardly knows how to\r\nanswer; what I mean to say is, that I occasionally allow Isidore the pleasure\r\nand honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt comes to the same thing\u2026. Now, Ginevra, to speak the plain truth, I don\u2019t\r\nvery well understand these matters; but I believe you are doing very\r\nwrong\u2014seriously wrong. Perhaps, however, you now feel certain that you will be\r\nable to marry M. Isidore; your parents and uncle have given their consent, and,\r\nfor your part, you love him entirely?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais pas du tout!\u201d (she always had recourse to French when about to say\r\nsomething specially heartless and perverse). \u201cJe suis sa reine, mais il n\u2019est\r\npas mon roi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I must believe this language is mere nonsense and coquetry. There\r\nis nothing great about you, yet you are above profiting by the good nature and\r\npurse of a man to whom you feel absolute indifference. You love M. Isidore far\r\nmore than you think, or will avow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. I danced with a young officer the other night, whom I love a thousand\r\ntimes more than he. I often wonder why I feel so very cold to Isidore, for\r\neverybody says he is handsome, and other ladies admire him; but, somehow, he\r\nbores me: let me see now how it is\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she seemed to make an effort to reflect. In this I encouraged her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d I said, \u201ctry to get a clear idea of the state of your mind. To me it\r\nseems in a great mess\u2014chaotic as a rag-bag.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is something in this fashion,\u201d she cried out ere long: \u201cthe man is too\r\nromantic and devoted, and he expects something more of me than I find it\r\nconvenient to be. He thinks I am perfect: furnished with all sorts of sterling\r\nqualities and solid virtues, such as I never had, nor intend to have. Now, one\r\ncan\u2019t help, in his presence, rather trying to justify his good opinion; and it\r\ndoes so tire one to be goody, and to talk sense,\u2014for he really thinks I am\r\nsensible. I am far more at my ease with you, old lady\u2014you, you dear\r\ncrosspatch\u2014who take me at my lowest, and know me to be coquettish, and\r\nignorant, and flirting, and fickle, and silly, and selfish, and all the other\r\nsweet things you and I have agreed to be a part of my character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is all very well,\u201d I said, making a strenuous effort to preserve that\r\ngravity and severity which ran risk of being shaken by this whimsical candour,\r\n\u201cbut it does not alter that wretched business of the presents. Pack them up,\r\nGinevra, like a good, honest girl, and send them back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I won\u2019t,\u201d said she, stoutly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are deceiving M. Isidore. It stands to reason that by accepting his\r\npresents you give him to understand he will one day receive an equivalent, in\r\nyour regard\u2026\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t,\u201d she interrupted: \u201che has his equivalent now, in the pleasure of\r\nseeing me wear them\u2014quite enough for him: he is only bourgeois.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis phrase, in its senseless arrogance, quite cured me of the temporary\r\nweakness which had made me relax my tone and aspect. She rattled on:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy present business is to enjoy youth, and not to think of fettering myself,\r\nby promise or vow, to this man or that. When first I saw Isidore, I believed he\r\nwould help me to enjoy it I believed he would be content with my being a pretty\r\ngirl; and that we should meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies,\r\nand be happy. Lo, and behold! I find him at times as grave as a judge, and\r\ndeep-feeling and thoughtful. Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes profonds et\r\npassionn\u00e9s ne sont pas \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far\r\nbetter. Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons! Vive les joies et les\r\nplaisirs! A bas les grandes passions et les s\u00e9v\u00e8res vertus!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked for an answer to this tirade. I gave none.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019aime mon beau Colonel,\u201d she went on: \u201cje n\u2019aimerai jamais son rival. Je ne\r\nserai jamais femme de bourgeois, moi!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI now signified that it was imperatively necessary my apartment should be\r\nrelieved of the honour of her presence: she went away laughing.\r\n\n"}
{"11": "\nCHAPTER X.\r\nDR JOHN.\n\r\nMadame Beck was a most consistent character; forbearing with all the world, and\r\ntender to no part of it. Her own children drew her into no deviation from the\r\neven tenor of her stoic calm. She was solicitous about her family, vigilant for\r\ntheir interests and physical well-being; but she never seemed to know the wish\r\nto take her little children upon her lap, to press their rosy lips with her\r\nown, to gather them in a genial embrace, to shower on them softly the benignant\r\ncaress, the loving word.\r\n\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes sitting in the garden, viewing the little bees\r\nafar off, as they walked in a distant alley with Trinette, their bonne;\r\nin her mien spoke care and prudence. I know she often pondered anxiously what\r\nshe called \u201cleur avenir;\u201d but if the youngest, a puny and delicate but engaging\r\nchild, chancing to spy her, broke from its nurse, and toddling down the walk,\r\ncame all eager and laughing and panting to clasp her knee, Madame would just\r\ncalmly put out one hand, so as to prevent inconvenient concussion from the\r\nchild\u2019s sudden onset: \u201cPrends garde, mon enfant!\u201d she would say unmoved,\r\npatiently permit it to stand near her a few moments, and then, without smile or\r\nkiss, or endearing syllable, rise and lead it back to Trinette.\r\n\n\r\nHer demeanour to the eldest girl was equally characteristic in another way.\r\nThis was a vicious child. \u201cQuelle peste que cette D\u00e9sir\u00e9e! Quel poison que cet\r\nenfant l\u00e0!\u201d were the expressions dedicated to her, alike in kitchen and in\r\nschoolroom. Amongst her other endowments she boasted an exquisite skill in the\r\nart, of provocation, sometimes driving her bonne and the servants almost\r\nwild. She would steal to their attics, open their drawers and boxes, wantonly\r\ntear their best caps and soil their best shawls; she would watch her\r\nopportunity to get at the buffet of the salle-\u00e0-manger, where she would smash\r\narticles of porcelain or glass\u2014or to the cupboard of the storeroom, where she\r\nwould plunder the preserves, drink the sweet wine, break jars and bottles, and\r\nso contrive as to throw the onus of suspicion on the cook and the kitchen-maid.\r\nAll this when Madame saw, and of which when she received report, her sole\r\nobservation, uttered with matchless serenity, was:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00e9sir\u00e9e a besoin d\u2019une surveillance toute particuli\u00e8re.\u201d Accordingly she kept\r\nthis promising olive-branch a good deal at her side. Never once, I believe, did\r\nshe tell her faithfully of her faults, explain the evil of such habits, and\r\nshow the results which must thence ensue. Surveillance must work the whole\r\ncure. It failed of course. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e was kept in some measure from the servants,\r\nbut she teased and pillaged her mamma instead. Whatever belonging to Madame\u2019s\r\nwork-table or toilet she could lay her hands on, she stole and hid. Madame saw\r\nall this, but she still pretended not to see: she had not rectitude of soul to\r\nconfront the child with her vices. When an article disappeared whose value\r\nrendered restitution necessary, she would profess to think that D\u00e9sir\u00e9e had\r\ntaken it away in play, and beg her to restore it. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e was not to be so\r\ncheated: she had learned to bring falsehood to the aid of theft, and would deny\r\nhaving touched the brooch, ring, or scissors. Carrying on the hollow system,\r\nthe mother would calmly assume an air of belief, and afterwards ceaselessly\r\nwatch and dog the child till she tracked her: to her hiding-places\u2014some hole in\r\nthe garden-wall\u2014some chink or cranny in garret or out-house. This done, Madame\r\nwould send D\u00e9sir\u00e9e out for a walk with her bonne, and profit by her\r\nabsence to rob the robber. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e proved herself the true daughter of her\r\nastute parent, by never suffering either her countenance or manner to betray\r\nthe least sign of mortification on discovering the loss.\r\n\n\r\nThe second child, Fifine, was said to be like its dead father. Certainly,\r\nthough the mother had given it her healthy frame, her blue eye and ruddy cheek,\r\nnot from her was derived its moral being. It was an honest, gleeful little\r\nsoul: a passionate, warm-tempered, bustling creature it was too, and of the\r\nsort likely to blunder often into perils and difficulties. One day it bethought\r\nitself to fall from top to bottom of a steep flight of stone steps; and when\r\nMadame, hearing the noise (she always heard every noise), issued from the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger and picked it up, she said quietly,\u2014\u201cCet enfant a un os de\r\ncass\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt first we hoped this was not the case. It was, however, but too true: one\r\nlittle plump arm hung powerless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet Meess\u201d (meaning me) \u201ctake her,\u201d said Madame; \u201cet qu\u2019on aille tout de suite\r\nchercher un fiacre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn a fiacre she promptly, but with admirable coolness and\r\nself-possession, departed to fetch a surgeon.\r\n\n\r\nIt appeared she did not find the family-surgeon at home; but that mattered not:\r\nshe sought until she laid her hand on a substitute to her mind, and brought him\r\nback with her. Meantime I had cut the child\u2019s sleeve from its arm, undressed\r\nand put it to bed.\r\n\n\r\nWe none of us, I suppose (by we I mean the bonne, the cook, the\r\nportress, and myself, all which personages were now gathered in the small and\r\nheated chamber), looked very scrutinizingly at the new doctor when he came into\r\nthe room. I, at least, was taken up with endeavouring to soothe Fifine; whose\r\ncries (for she had good lungs) were appalling to hear. These cries redoubled in\r\nintensity as the stranger approached her bed; when he took her up, \u201cLet alone!\u201d\r\nshe cried passionately, in her broken English (for she spoke English as did the\r\nother children). \u201cI will not you: I will Dr. Pillule!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Dr. Pillule is my very good friend,\u201d was the answer, in perfect English;\r\n\u201cbut he is busy at a place three leagues off, and I am come in his stead. So\r\nnow, when we get a little calmer, we must commence business; and we will soon\r\nhave that unlucky little arm bandaged and in right order.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHereupon he called for a glass of eau sucr\u00e9e, fed her with some\r\nteaspoonfuls of the sweet liquid (Fifine was a frank gourmande; anybody could\r\nwin her heart through her palate), promised her more when the operation should\r\nbe over, and promptly went to work. Some assistance being needed, he demanded\r\nit of the cook, a robust, strong-armed woman; but she, the portress, and the\r\nnurse instantly fled. I did not like to touch that small, tortured limb, but\r\nthinking there was no alternative, my hand was already extended to do what was\r\nrequisite. I was anticipated; Madame Beck had put out her own hand: hers was\r\nsteady while mine trembled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCa vaudra mieux,\u201d said the doctor, turning from me to her.\r\n\n\r\nHe showed wisdom in his choice. Mine would have been feigned stoicism, forced\r\nfortitude. Hers was neither forced nor feigned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerci, Madame; tr\u00e8s bien, fort bien!\u201d said the operator when he had finished.\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 un sang-froid bien opportun, et qui vaut mille \u00e9lans de sensibilit\u00e9\r\nd\u00e9plac\u00e9e.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was pleased with her firmness, she with his compliment. It was likely, too,\r\nthat his whole general appearance, his voice, mien, and manner, wrought\r\nimpressions in his favour. Indeed, when you looked well at him, and when a lamp\r\nwas brought in\u2014for it was evening and now waxing dusk\u2014you saw that, unless\r\nMadame Beck had been less than woman, it could not well be otherwise. This\r\nyoung doctor (he was young) had no common aspect. His stature looked\r\nimposingly tall in that little chamber, and amidst that group of Dutch-made\r\nwomen; his profile was clear, fine and expressive: perhaps his eye glanced from\r\nface to face rather too vividly, too quickly, and too often; but it had a most\r\npleasant character, and so had his mouth; his chin was full, cleft, Grecian,\r\nand perfect. As to his smile, one could not in a hurry make up one\u2019s mind as to\r\nthe descriptive epithet it merited; there was something in it that pleased, but\r\nsomething too that brought surging up into the mind all one\u2019s foibles and weak\r\npoints: all that could lay one open to a laugh. Yet Fifine liked this doubtful\r\nsmile, and thought the owner genial: much as he had hurt her, she held out her\r\nhand to bid him a friendly good-night. He patted the little hand kindly, and\r\nthen he and Madame went down-stairs together; she talking in her highest tide\r\nof spirits and volubility, he listening with an air of good-natured amenity,\r\ndashed with that unconscious roguish archness I find it difficult to describe.\r\n\n\r\nI noticed that though he spoke French well, he spoke English better; he had,\r\ntoo, an English complexion, eyes, and form. I noticed more. As he passed me in\r\nleaving the room, turning his face in my direction one moment\u2014not to address\r\nme, but to speak to Madame, yet so standing, that I almost necessarily looked\r\nup at him\u2014a recollection which had been struggling to form in my memory, since\r\nthe first moment I heard his voice, started up perfected. This was the very\r\ngentleman to whom I had spoken at the bureau; who had helped me in the matter\r\nof the trunk; who had been my guide through the dark, wet park. Listening, as\r\nhe passed down the long vestibule out into the street, I recognised his very\r\ntread: it was the same firm and equal stride I had followed under the dripping\r\ntrees.\r\n\n\r\nIt was to be concluded that this young surgeon-physician\u2019s first visit to the\r\nRue Fossette would be the last. The respectable Dr. Pillule being expected home\r\nthe next day, there appeared no reason why his temporary substitute should\r\nagain represent him; but the Fates had written their decree to the contrary.\r\n\n\r\nDr. Pillule had been summoned to see a rich old hypochondriac at the antique\r\nuniversity town of Bouquin-Moisi, and upon his prescribing change of air and\r\ntravel as remedies, he was retained to accompany the timid patient on a tour of\r\nsome weeks; it but remained, therefore, for the new doctor to continue his\r\nattendance at the Rue Fossette.\r\n\n\r\nI often saw him when he came; for Madame would not trust the little invalid to\r\nTrinette, but required me to spend much of my time in the nursery. I think he\r\nwas skilful. Fifine recovered rapidly under his care, yet even her\r\nconvalescence did not hasten his dismissal. Destiny and Madame Beck seemed in\r\nleague, and both had ruled that he should make deliberate acquaintance with the\r\nvestibule, the private staircase and upper chambers of the Rue Fossette.\r\n\n\r\nNo sooner did Fifine emerge from his hands than D\u00e9sir\u00e9e declared herself ill.\r\nThat possessed child had a genius for simulation, and captivated by the\r\nattentions and indulgences of a sick-room, she came to the conclusion that an\r\nillness would perfectly accommodate her tastes, and took her bed accordingly.\r\nShe acted well, and her mother still better; for while the whole case was\r\ntransparent to Madame Beck as the day, she treated it with an astonishingly\r\nwell-assured air of gravity and good faith.\r\n\n\r\nWhat surprised me was, that Dr. John (so the young Englishman had taught Fifine\r\nto call him, and we all took from her the habit of addressing him by this name,\r\ntill it became an established custom, and he was known by no other in the Rue\r\nFossette)\u2014that Dr. John consented tacitly to adopt Madame\u2019s tactics, and to\r\nfall in with her man\u0153uvres. He betrayed, indeed, a period of comic doubt, cast\r\none or two rapid glances from the child to the mother, indulged in an interval\r\nof self-consultation, but finally resigned himself with a good grace to play\r\nhis part in the farce. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e eat like a raven, gambolled day and night in her\r\nbed, pitched tents with the sheets and blankets, lounged like a Turk amidst\r\npillows and bolsters, diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne and\r\ngrimacing at her sisters\u2014over-flowed, in short, with unmerited health and evil\r\nspirits; only languishing when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal\r\nvisit. Madame Beck, I knew, was glad, at any price, to have her daughter in bed\r\nout of the way of mischief; but I wondered that Dr. John did not tire of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\n\r\nEvery day, on this mere pretext of a motive, he gave punctual attendance;\r\nMadame always received him with the same empressement, the same sunshine for\r\nhimself, the same admirably counterfeited air of concern for her child. Dr.\r\nJohn wrote harmless prescriptions for the patient, and viewed her mother with a\r\nshrewdly sparkling eye. Madame caught his rallying looks without resenting\r\nthem\u2014she had too much good sense for that. Supple as the young doctor seemed,\r\none could not despise him\u2014this pliant part was evidently not adopted in the\r\ndesign to curry favour with his employer: while he liked his office at the\r\npensionnat, and lingered strangely about the Rue Fossette, he was independent,\r\nalmost careless in his carriage there; and yet, too, he was often thoughtful\r\nand preoccupied.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not perhaps my business to observe the mystery of his bearing, or search\r\nout its origin or aim; but, placed as I was, I could hardly help it. He laid\r\nhimself open to my observation, according to my presence in the room just that\r\ndegree of notice and consequence a person of my exterior habitually expects:\r\nthat is to say, about what is given to unobtrusive articles of furniture,\r\nchairs of ordinary joiner\u2019s work, and carpets of no striking pattern. Often,\r\nwhile waiting for Madame, he would muse, smile, watch, or listen like a man who\r\nthinks himself alone. I, meantime, was free to puzzle over his countenance and\r\nmovements, and wonder what could be the meaning of that peculiar interest and\r\nattachment\u2014all mixed up with doubt and strangeness, and inexplicably ruled by\r\nsome presiding spell\u2014which wedded him to this demi-convent, secluded in the\r\nbuilt-up core of a capital. He, I believe, never remembered that I had eyes in\r\nmy head, much less a brain behind them.\r\n\n\r\nNor would he ever have found this out, but that one day, while he sat in the\r\nsunshine and I was observing the colouring of his hair, whiskers, and\r\ncomplexion\u2014the whole being of such a tone as a strong light brings out with\r\nsomewhat perilous force (indeed I recollect I was driven to compare his beamy\r\nhead in my thoughts to that of the \u201cgolden image\u201d which Nebuchadnezzar the king\r\nhad set up), an idea new, sudden, and startling, riveted my attention with an\r\nover-mastering strength and power of attraction. I know not to this day how I\r\nlooked at him: the force of surprise, and also of conviction, made me forget\r\nmyself; and I only recovered wonted consciousness when I saw that his notice\r\nwas arrested, and that it had caught my movement in a clear little oval mirror\r\nfixed in the side of the window recess\u2014by the aid of which reflector Madame\r\noften secretly spied persons walking in the garden below. Though of so gay and\r\nsanguine a temperament, he was not without a certain nervous sensitiveness\r\nwhich made him ill at ease under a direct, inquiring gaze. On surprising me\r\nthus, he turned and said, in a tone which, though courteous, had just so much\r\ndryness in it as to mark a shade of annoyance, as well as to give to what was\r\nsaid the character of rebuke, \u201cMademoiselle does not spare me: I am not vain\r\nenough to fancy that it is my merits which attract her attention; it must then\r\nbe some defect. Dare I ask\u2014what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was confounded, as the reader may suppose, yet not with an irrecoverable\r\nconfusion; being conscious that it was from no emotion of incautious\r\nadmiration, nor yet in a spirit of unjustifiable inquisitiveness, that I had\r\nincurred this reproof. I might have cleared myself on the spot, but would not.\r\nI did not speak. I was not in the habit of speaking to him. Suffering him,\r\nthen, to think what he chose and accuse me of what he would, I resumed some\r\nwork I had dropped, and kept my head bent over it during the remainder of his\r\nstay. There is a perverse mood of the mind which is rather soothed than\r\nirritated by misconstruction; and in quarters where we can never be rightly\r\nknown, we take pleasure, I think, in being consummately ignored. What honest\r\nman, on being casually taken for a housebreaker, does not feel rather tickled\r\nthan vexed at the mistake?\r\n\n"}
{"12": "\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE PORTRESS\u2019S CABINET.\n\r\nIt was summer and very hot. Georgette, the youngest of Madame Beck\u2019s children,\r\ntook a fever. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, suddenly cured of her ailments, was, together with\r\nFifine, packed off to Bonne-Maman, in the country, by way of precaution against\r\ninfection. Medical aid was now really needed, and Madame, choosing to ignore\r\nthe return of Dr. Pillule, who had been at home a week, conjured his English\r\nrival to continue his visits. One or two of the pensionnaires complained of\r\nheadache, and in other respects seemed slightly to participate in Georgette\u2019s\r\nailment. \u201cNow, at last,\u201d I thought, \u201cDr. Pillule must be recalled: the prudent\r\ndirectress will never venture to permit the attendance of so young a man on the\r\npupils.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe directress was very prudent, but she could also be intrepidly venturous.\r\nShe actually introduced Dr. John to the school-division of the premises, and\r\nestablished him in attendance on the proud and handsome Blanche de Melcy, and\r\nthe vain, flirting Ang\u00e9lique, her friend. Dr. John, I thought, testified a\r\ncertain gratification at this mark of confidence; and if discretion of bearing\r\ncould have justified the step, it would by him have been amply justified. Here,\r\nhowever, in this land of convents and confessionals, such a presence as his was\r\nnot to be suffered with impunity in a \u201cpensionnat de demoiselles.\u201d The school\r\ngossiped, the kitchen whispered, the town caught the rumour, parents wrote\r\nletters and paid visits of remonstrance. Madame, had she been weak, would now\r\nhave been lost: a dozen rival educational houses were ready to improve this\r\nfalse step\u2014if false step it were\u2014to her ruin; but Madame was not weak, and\r\nlittle Jesuit though she might be, yet I clapped the hands of my heart, and\r\nwith its voice cried \u201cbrava!\u201d as I watched her able bearing, her skilled\r\nmanagement, her temper and her firmness on this occasion.\r\n\n\r\nShe met the alarmed parents with a good-humoured, easy grace for nobody matched\r\nher in, I know not whether to say the possession or the assumption of a certain\r\n\u201crondeur et franchise de bonne femme;\u201d which on various occasions gained the\r\npoint aimed at with instant and complete success, where severe gravity and\r\nserious reasoning would probably have failed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCe pauvre Docteur Jean!\u201d she would say, chuckling and rubbing joyously her fat\r\nlittle white hands; \u201cce cher jeune homme! le meilleur cr\u00e9ature du monde!\u201d and\r\ngo on to explain how she happened to be employing him for her own children, who\r\nwere so fond of him they would scream themselves into fits at the thought of\r\nanother doctor; how, where she had confidence for her own, she thought it\r\nnatural to repose trust for others, and au reste, it was only the most\r\ntemporary expedient in the world; Blanche and Ang\u00e9lique had the migraine; Dr.\r\nJohn had written a prescription; voil\u00e0 tout!\r\n\n\r\nThe parents\u2019 mouths were closed. Blanche and Ang\u00e9lique saved her all remaining\r\ntrouble by chanting loud duets in their physician\u2019s praise; the other pupils\r\nechoed them, unanimously declaring that when they were ill they would have Dr.\r\nJohn and nobody else; and Madame laughed, and the parents laughed too. The\r\nLabassecouriens must have a large organ of philoprogenitiveness: at least the\r\nindulgence of offspring is carried by them to excessive lengths; the law of\r\nmost households being the children\u2019s will. Madame now got credit for having\r\nacted on this occasion in a spirit of motherly partiality: she came off with\r\nflying colours; people liked her as a directress better than ever.\r\n\n\r\nTo this day I never fully understood why she thus risked her interest for the\r\nsake of Dr. John. What people said, of course I know well: the whole\r\nhouse\u2014pupils, teachers, servants included\u2014affirmed that she was going to marry\r\nhim. So they had settled it; difference of age seemed to make no obstacle in\r\ntheir eyes: it was to be so.\r\n\n\r\nIt must be admitted that appearances did not wholly discountenance this idea;\r\nMadame seemed so bent on retaining his services, so oblivious of her former\r\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9, Pillule. She made, too, such a point of personally receiving his\r\nvisits, and was so unfailingly cheerful, blithe, and benignant in her manner to\r\nhim. Moreover, she paid, about this time, marked attention to dress: the\r\nmorning dishabille, the nightcap and shawl, were discarded; Dr. John\u2019s early\r\nvisits always found her with auburn braids all nicely arranged, silk dress\r\ntrimly fitted on, neat laced brodequins in lieu of slippers: in short the whole\r\ntoilette complete as a model, and fresh as a flower. I scarcely think, however,\r\nthat her intention in this went further than just to show a very handsome man\r\nthat she was not quite a plain woman; and plain she was not. Without beauty of\r\nfeature or elegance of form, she pleased. Without youth and its gay graces, she\r\ncheered. One never tired of seeing her: she was never monotonous, or insipid,\r\nor colourless, or flat. Her unfaded hair, her eye with its temperate blue\r\nlight, her cheek with its wholesome fruit-like bloom\u2014these things pleased in\r\nmoderation, but with constancy.\r\n\n\r\nHad she, indeed, floating visions of adopting Dr. John as a husband, taking him\r\nto her well-furnished home, endowing him with her savings, which were said to\r\namount to a moderate competency, and making him comfortable for the rest of his\r\nlife? Did Dr. John suspect her of such visions? I have met him coming out of\r\nher presence with a mischievous half-smile about his lips, and in his eyes a\r\nlook as of masculine vanity elate and tickled. With all his good looks and\r\ngood-nature, he was not perfect; he must have been very imperfect if he\r\nroguishly encouraged aims he never intended to be successful. But did he not\r\nintend them to be successful? People said he had no money, that he was wholly\r\ndependent upon his profession. Madame\u2014though perhaps some fourteen years his\r\nsenior\u2014was yet the sort of woman never to grow old, never to wither, never to\r\nbreak down. They certainly were on good terms. He perhaps was not in\r\nlove; but how many people ever do love, or at least marry for love, in\r\nthis world. We waited the end.\r\n\n\r\nFor what he waited, I do not know, nor for what he watched; but the\r\npeculiarity of his manner, his expectant, vigilant, absorbed, eager look, never\r\nwore off: it rather intensified. He had never been quite within the compass of\r\nmy penetration, and I think he ranged farther and farther beyond it.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning little Georgette had been more feverish and consequently more\r\npeevish; she was crying, and would not be pacified. I thought a particular\r\ndraught ordered, disagreed with her, and I doubted whether it ought to be\r\ncontinued; I waited impatiently for the doctor\u2019s coming in order to consult\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, he was admitted; I felt sure of this, for I heard his voice\r\naddressing the portress. It was his custom to mount straight to the nursery,\r\ntaking about three degrees of the staircase at once, and coming upon us like a\r\ncheerful surprise. Five minutes elapsed\u2014ten\u2014and I saw and heard nothing of him.\r\nWhat could he be doing? Possibly waiting in the corridor below. Little\r\nGeorgette still piped her plaintive wail, appealing to me by her familiar term,\r\n\u201cMinnie, Minnie, me very poorly!\u201d till my heart ached. I descended to ascertain\r\nwhy he did not come. The corridor was empty. Whither was he vanished? Was he\r\nwith Madame in the salle-\u00e0-manger? Impossible: I had left her but a\r\nshort time since, dressing in her own chamber. I listened. Three pupils were\r\njust then hard at work practising in three proximate rooms\u2014the dining-room and\r\nthe greater and lesser drawing-rooms, between which and the corridor there was\r\nbut the portress\u2019s cabinet communicating with the salons, and intended\r\noriginally for a boudoir. Farther off, at a fourth instrument in the oratory, a\r\nwhole class of a dozen or more were taking a singing lesson, and just then\r\njoining in a \u201cbarcarole\u201d (I think they called it), whereof I yet remember these\r\nwords \u201cfra\u00eech\u00eb,\u201d \u201cbris\u00eb,\u201d and \u201cVenis\u00eb.\u201d Under these circumstances, what could I\r\nhear? A great deal, certainly; had it only been to the purpose.\r\n\n\r\nYes; I heard a giddy treble laugh in the above-mentioned little cabinet, close\r\nby the door of which I stood\u2014that door half-unclosed; a man\u2019s voice in a soft,\r\ndeep, pleading tone, uttered some words, whereof I only caught the adjuration,\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d Then, after a second\u2019s pause, forth issued Dr. John, his eye\r\nfull shining, but not with either joy or triumph; his fair English cheek\r\nhigh-coloured; a baffled, tortured, anxious, and yet a tender meaning on his\r\nbrow.\r\n\n\r\nThe open door served me as a screen; but had I been full in his way, I believe\r\nhe would have passed without seeing me. Some mortification, some strong\r\nvexation had hold of his soul: or rather, to write my impressions now as I\r\nreceived them at the time I should say some sorrow, some sense of injustice. I\r\ndid not so much think his pride was hurt, as that his affections had been\r\nwounded\u2014cruelly wounded, it seemed to me. But who was the torturer? What being\r\nin that house had him so much in her power? Madame I believed to be in her\r\nchamber; the room whence he had stepped was dedicated to the portress\u2019s sole\r\nuse; and she, Rosine Matou, an unprincipled though pretty little French\r\ngrisette, airy, fickle, dressy, vain, and mercenary\u2014it was not, surely, to\r\nher hand he owed the ordeal through which he seemed to have passed?\r\n\n\r\nBut while I pondered, her voice, clear, though somewhat sharp, broke out in a\r\nlightsome French song, trilling through the door still ajar: I glanced in,\r\ndoubting my senses. There at the table she sat in a smart dress of \u201cjaconas\r\nrose,\u201d trimming a tiny blond cap: not a living thing save herself was in the\r\nroom, except indeed some gold fish in a glass globe, some flowers in pots, and\r\na broad July sunbeam.\r\n\n\r\nHere was a problem: but I must go up-stairs to ask about the medicine.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John sat in a chair at Georgette\u2019s bedside; Madame stood before him; the\r\nlittle patient had been examined and soothed, and now lay composed in her crib.\r\nMadame Beck, as I entered, was discussing the physician\u2019s own health, remarking\r\non some real or fancied change in his looks, charging him with over-work, and\r\nrecommending rest and change of air. He listened good-naturedly, but with\r\nlaughing indifference, telling her that she was \u201ctrop bonne,\u201d and that he felt\r\nperfectly well. Madame appealed to me\u2014Dr. John following her movement with a\r\nslow glance which seemed to express languid surprise at reference being made to\r\na quarter so insignificant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Miss Lucie?\u201d asked Madame. \u201cIs he not paler and thinner?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was very seldom that I uttered more than monosyllables in Dr. John\u2019s\r\npresence; he was the kind of person with whom I was likely ever to remain the\r\nneutral, passive thing he thought me. Now, however, I took licence to answer in\r\na phrase: and a phrase I purposely made quite significant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe looks ill at this moment; but perhaps it is owing to some temporary cause:\r\nDr. John may have been vexed or harassed.\u201d I cannot tell how he took this\r\nspeech, as I never sought his face for information. Georgette here began to ask\r\nme in her broken English if she might have a glass of eau sucr\u00e9e. I\r\nanswered her in English. For the first time, I fancy, he noticed that I spoke\r\nhis language; hitherto he had always taken me for a foreigner, addressing me as\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d and giving in French the requisite directions about the\r\nchildren\u2019s treatment. He seemed on the point of making a remark; but thinking\r\nbetter of it, held his tongue.\r\n\n\r\nMadame recommenced advising him; he shook his head, laughing, rose and bid her\r\ngood-morning, with courtesy, but still with the regardless air of one whom too\r\nmuch unsolicited attention was surfeiting and spoiling.\r\n\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Madame dropped into the chair he had just left; she rested\r\nher chin in her hand; all that was animated and amiable vanished from her face:\r\nshe looked stony and stern, almost mortified and morose. She sighed; a single,\r\nbut a deep sigh. A loud bell rang for morning-school. She got up; as she passed\r\na dressing-table with a glass upon it, she looked at her reflected image. One\r\nsingle white hair streaked her nut-brown tresses; she plucked it out with a\r\nshudder. In the full summer daylight, her face, though it still had the colour,\r\ncould plainly be seen to have lost the texture of youth; and then, where were\r\nyouth\u2019s contours? Ah, Madame! wise as you were, even you knew weakness.\r\nNever had I pitied Madame before, but my heart softened towards her, when she\r\nturned darkly from the glass. A calamity had come upon her. That hag\r\nDisappointment was greeting her with a grisly \u201cAll-hail,\u201d and her soul rejected\r\nthe intimacy.\r\n\n\r\nBut Rosine! My bewilderment there surpasses description. I embraced five\r\nopportunities of passing her cabinet that day, with a view to contemplating her\r\ncharms, and finding out the secret of their influence. She was pretty, young,\r\nand wore a well-made dress. All very good points, and, I suppose, amply\r\nsufficient to account, in any philosophic mind, for any amount of agony and\r\ndistraction in a young man, like Dr. John. Still, I could not help forming half\r\na wish that the said doctor were my brother; or at least that he had a sister\r\nor a mother who would kindly sermonize him. I say half a wish; I broke\r\nit, and flung it away before it became a whole one, discovering in good time\r\nits exquisite folly. \u201cSomebody,\u201d I argued, \u201cmight as well sermonize Madame\r\nabout her young physician: and what good would that do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI believe Madame sermonized herself. She did not behave weakly, or make herself\r\nin any shape ridiculous. It is true she had neither strong feelings to\r\novercome, nor tender feelings by which to be miserably pained. It is true\r\nlikewise that she had an important avocation, a real business to fill her time,\r\ndivert her thoughts, and divide her interest. It is especially true that she\r\npossessed a genuine good sense which is not given to all women nor to all men;\r\nand by dint of these combined advantages she behaved wisely\u2014she behaved well.\r\nBrava! once more, Madame Beck. I saw you matched against an Apollyon of a\r\npredilection; you fought a good fight, and you overcame!\r\n\n"}
{"13": "\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE CASKET.\n\r\nBehind the house at the Rue Fossette there was a garden\u2014large, considering that\r\nit lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection at this day it seems\r\npleasant: but time, like distance, lends to certain scenes an influence so\r\nsoftening; and where all is stone around, blank wall and hot pavement, how\r\nprecious seems one shrub, how lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!\r\n\n\r\nThere went a tradition that Madame Beck\u2019s house had in old days been a convent.\r\nThat in years gone by\u2014how long gone by I cannot tell, but I think some\r\ncenturies\u2014before the city had over-spread this quarter, and when it was tilled\r\nground and avenue, and such deep and leafy seclusion as ought to embosom a\r\nreligious house\u2014that something had happened on this site which, rousing fear\r\nand inflicting horror, had left to the place the inheritance of a ghost-story.\r\nA vague tale went of a black and white nun, sometimes, on some night or nights\r\nof the year, seen in some part of this vicinage. The ghost must have been built\r\nout some ages ago, for there were houses all round now; but certain\r\nconvent-relics, in the shape of old and huge fruit-trees, yet consecrated the\r\nspot; and, at the foot of one\u2014a Methuselah of a pear-tree, dead, all but a few\r\nboughs which still faithfully renewed their perfumed snow in spring, and their\r\nhoney-sweet pendants in autumn\u2014you saw, in scraping away the mossy earth\r\nbetween the half-bared roots, a glimpse of slab, smooth, hard, and black. The\r\nlegend went, unconfirmed and unaccredited, but still propagated, that this was\r\nthe portal of a vault, imprisoning deep beneath that ground, on whose surface\r\ngrass grew and flowers bloomed, the bones of a girl whom a monkish conclave of\r\nthe drear middle ages had here buried alive for some sin against her vow. Her\r\nshadow it was that tremblers had feared, through long generations after her\r\npoor frame was dust; her black robe and white veil that, for timid eyes,\r\nmoonlight and shade had mocked, as they fluctuated in the night-wind through\r\nthe garden-thicket.\r\n\n\r\nIndependently of romantic rubbish, however, that old garden had its charms. On\r\nsummer mornings I used to rise early, to enjoy them alone; on summer evenings,\r\nto linger solitary, to keep tryste with the rising moon, or taste one kiss of\r\nthe evening breeze, or fancy rather than feel the freshness of dew descending.\r\nThe turf was verdant, the gravelled walks were white; sun-bright nasturtiums\r\nclustered beautiful about the roots of the doddered orchard giants. There was a\r\nlarge berceau, above which spread the shade of an acacia; there was a smaller,\r\nmore sequestered bower, nestled in the vines which ran all along a high and\r\ngrey wall, and gathered their tendrils in a knot of beauty, and hung their\r\nclusters in loving profusion about the favoured spot where jasmine and ivy met\r\nand married them.\r\n\n\r\nDoubtless at high noon, in the broad, vulgar middle of the day, when Madame\r\nBeck\u2019s large school turned out rampant, and externes and pensionnaires were\r\nspread abroad, vying with the denizens of the boys\u2019 college close at hand, in\r\nthe brazen exercise of their lungs and limbs\u2014doubtless then the garden\r\nwas a trite, trodden-down place enough. But at sunset or the hour of\r\nsalut, when the externes were gone home, and the boarders quiet at their\r\nstudies; pleasant was it then to stray down the peaceful alleys, and hear the\r\nbells of St. Jean Baptiste peal out with their sweet, soft, exalted sound.\r\n\n\r\nI was walking thus one evening, and had been detained farther within the verge\r\nof twilight than usual, by the still-deepening calm, the mellow coolness, the\r\nfragrant breathing with which flowers no sunshine could win now answered the\r\npersuasion of the dew. I saw by a light in the oratory window that the Catholic\r\nhousehold were then gathered to evening prayer\u2014a rite, from attendance on\r\nwhich, I now and then, as a Protestant, exempted myself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne moment longer,\u201d whispered solitude and the summer moon, \u201cstay with us: all\r\nis truly quiet now; for another quarter of an hour your presence will not be\r\nmissed: the day\u2019s heat and bustle have tired you; enjoy these precious\r\nminutes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe windowless backs of houses built in this garden, and in particular the\r\nwhole of one side, was skirted by the rear of a long line of premises\u2014being the\r\nboarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This rear, however, was all blank\r\nstone, with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up, opening from the\r\nsleeping-rooms of the women-servants, and also one casement in a lower story\r\nsaid to mark the chamber or study of a master. But, though thus secure, an\r\nalley, which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was\r\nforbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed \u201cl\u2019all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue,\u201d\r\nand any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe\r\na penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck\u2019s establishment permitted. Teachers\r\nmight indeed go there with impunity; but as the walk was narrow, and the\r\nneglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side, weaving overhead\r\na roof of branch and leaf which the sun\u2019s rays penetrated but in rare chequers,\r\nthis alley was seldom entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully\r\nshunned.\r\n\n\r\nFrom the first I was tempted to make an exception to this rule of avoidance:\r\nthe seclusion, the very gloom of the walk attracted me. For a long time the\r\nfear of seeming singular scared me away; but by degrees, as people became\r\naccustomed to me and my habits, and to such shades of peculiarity as were\r\nengrained in my nature\u2014shades, certainly not striking enough to interest, and\r\nperhaps not prominent enough to offend, but born in and with me, and no more to\r\nbe parted with than my identity\u2014by slow degrees I became a frequenter of this\r\nstrait and narrow path. I made myself gardener of some tintless flowers that\r\ngrew between its closely-ranked shrubs; I cleared away the relics of past\r\nautumns, choking up a rustic seat at the far end. Borrowing of Goton, the\r\ncuisini\u00e8re, a pail of water and a scrubbing-brush, I made this seat clean.\r\nMadame saw me at work and smiled approbation: whether sincerely or not I don\u2019t\r\nknow; but she seemed sincere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoyez-vous,\u201d cried she, \u201ccomme elle est propre, cette demoiselle Lucie? Vous\r\naimez donc cette all\u00e9e, meess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is quiet and shady.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est juste,\u201d cried she with an air of bont\u00e9; and she kindly recommended me to\r\nconfine myself to it as much as I chose, saying, that as I was not charged with\r\nthe surveillance, I need not trouble myself to walk with the pupils: only I\r\nmight permit her children to come there, to talk English with me.\r\n\n\r\nOn the night in question, I was sitting on the hidden seat reclaimed from fungi\r\nand mould, listening to what seemed the far-off sounds of the city. Far off, in\r\ntruth, they were not: this school was in the city\u2019s centre; hence, it was but\r\nfive minutes\u2019 walk to the park, scarce ten to buildings of palatial splendour.\r\nQuite near were wide streets brightly lit, teeming at this moment with life:\r\ncarriages were rolling through them to balls or to the opera. The same hour\r\nwhich tolled curfew for our convent, which extinguished each lamp, and dropped\r\nthe curtain round each couch, rang for the gay city about us the summons to\r\nfestal enjoyment. Of this contrast I thought not, however: gay instincts my\r\nnature had few; ball or opera I had never seen; and though often I had heard\r\nthem described, and even wished to see them, it was not the wish of one who\r\nhopes to partake a pleasure if she could only reach it\u2014who feels fitted to\r\nshine in some bright distant sphere, could she but thither win her way; it was\r\nno yearning to attain, no hunger to taste; only the calm desire to look on a\r\nnew thing.\r\n\n\r\nA moon was in the sky, not a full moon, but a young crescent. I saw her through\r\na space in the boughs overhead. She and the stars, visible beside her, were no\r\nstrangers where all else was strange: my childhood knew them. I had seen that\r\ngolden sign with the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure, beside an\r\nold thorn at the top of an old field, in Old England, in long past days, just\r\nas it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this continental capital.\r\n\n\r\nOh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, little as I spoke, cold\r\nas I looked, when I thought of past days, I could feel. About the\r\npresent, it was better to be stoical; about the future\u2014such a future as mine\u2014to\r\nbe dead. And in catalepsy and a dead trance, I studiously held the quick of my\r\nnature.\r\n\n\r\nAt that time, I well remember whatever could excite\u2014certain accidents of the\r\nweather, for instance, were almost dreaded by me, because they woke the being I\r\nwas always lulling, and stirred up a craving cry I could not satisfy. One night\r\na thunder-storm broke; a sort of hurricane shook us in our beds: the Catholics\r\nrose in panic and prayed to their saints. As for me, the tempest took hold of\r\nme with tyranny: I was roughly roused and obliged to live. I got up and dressed\r\nmyself, and creeping outside the casement close by my bed, sat on its ledge,\r\nwith my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building. It was wet, it was\r\nwild, it was pitch-dark. Within the dormitory they gathered round the\r\nnight-lamp in consternation, praying loud. I could not go in: too resistless\r\nwas the delight of staying with the wild hour, black and full of thunder,\r\npealing out such an ode as language never delivered to man\u2014too terribly\r\nglorious, the spectacle of clouds, split and pierced by white and blinding\r\nbolts.\r\n\n\r\nI did long, achingly, then and for four and twenty hours afterwards, for\r\nsomething to fetch me out of my present existence, and lead me upwards and\r\nonwards. This longing, and all of a similar kind, it was necessary to knock on\r\nthe head; which I did, figuratively, after the manner of Jael to Sisera,\r\ndriving a nail through their temples. Unlike Sisera, they did not die: they\r\nwere but transiently stunned, and at intervals would turn on the nail with a\r\nrebellious wrench: then did the temples bleed, and the brain thrill to its\r\ncore.\r\n\n\r\nTo-night, I was not so mutinous, nor so miserable. My Sisera lay quiet in the\r\ntent, slumbering; and if his pain ached through his slumbers, something like an\r\nangel\u2014the ideal\u2014knelt near, dropping balm on the soothed temples, holding\r\nbefore the sealed eyes a magic glass, of which the sweet, solemn visions were\r\nrepeated in dreams, and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings and robe\r\nover the transfixed sleeper, over the tent threshold, over all the landscape\r\nlying without. Jael, the stern woman; sat apart, relenting somewhat over her\r\ncaptive; but more prone to dwell on the faithful expectation of Heber coming\r\nhome. By which words I mean that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the night\r\nfilled me with a mood of hope: not hope on any definite point, but a general\r\nsense of encouragement and heart-ease.\r\n\n\r\nShould not such a mood, so sweet, so tranquil, so unwonted, have been the\r\nharbinger of good? Alas, no good came of it! I Presently the rude Real burst\r\ncoarsely in\u2014all evil grovelling and repellent as she too often is.\r\n\n\r\nAmid the intense stillness of that pile of stone overlooking the walk, the\r\ntrees, the high wall, I heard a sound; a casement [all the windows here are\r\ncasements, opening on hinges] creaked. Ere I had time to look up and mark\r\nwhere, in which story, or by whom unclosed, a tree overhead shook, as if struck\r\nby a missile; some object dropped prone at my feet.\r\n\n\r\nNine was striking by St. Jean Baptiste\u2019s clock; day was fading, but it was not\r\ndark: the crescent moon aided little, but the deep gilding of that point in\r\nheaven where the sun beamed last, and the crystalline clearness of a wide space\r\nabove, sustained the summer twilight; even in my dark walk I could, by\r\napproaching an opening, have managed to read print of a small type. Easy was it\r\nto see then that the missile was a box, a small box of white and coloured\r\nivory; its loose lid opened in my hand; violets lay within, violets smothering\r\na closely folded bit of pink paper, a note, superscribed, \u201cPour la robe grise.\u201d\r\nI wore indeed a dress of French grey.\r\n\n\r\nGood. Was this a billet-doux? A thing I had heard of, but hitherto had not had\r\nthe honour of seeing or handling. Was it this sort of commodity I held between\r\nmy finger and thumb at this moment?\r\n\n\r\nScarcely: I did not dream it for a moment. Suitor or admirer my very thoughts\r\nhad not conceived. All the teachers had dreams of some lover; one (but she was\r\nnaturally of a credulous turn) believed in a future husband. All the pupils\r\nabove fourteen knew of some prospective bridegroom; two or three were already\r\naffianced by their parents, and had been so from childhood: but into the realm\r\nof feelings and hopes which such prospects open, my speculations, far less my\r\npresumptions, had never once had warrant to intrude. If the other teachers went\r\ninto town, or took a walk on the boulevards, or only attended mass, they were\r\nvery certain (according to the accounts brought back) to meet with some\r\nindividual of the \u201copposite sex,\u201d whose rapt, earnest gaze assured them of\r\ntheir power to strike and to attract. I can\u2019t say that my experience tallied\r\nwith theirs, in this respect. I went to church and I took walks, and am very\r\nwell convinced that nobody minded me. There was not a girl or woman in the Rue\r\nFossette who could not, and did not testify to having received an admiring beam\r\nfrom our young doctor\u2019s blue eyes at one time or other. I am obliged, however\r\nhumbling it may sound, to except myself: as far as I was concerned, those blue\r\neyes were guiltless, and calm as the sky, to whose tint theirs seemed akin. So\r\nit came to pass that I heard the others talk, wondered often at their gaiety,\r\nsecurity, and self-satisfaction, but did not trouble myself to look up and gaze\r\nalong the path they seemed so certain of treading. This then was no\r\nbillet-doux; and it was in settled conviction to the contrary that I quietly\r\nopened it. Thus it ran\u2014I translate:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAngel of my dreams! A thousand, thousand thanks for the promise kept: scarcely\r\ndid I venture to hope its fulfilment. I believed you, indeed, to be half in\r\njest; and then you seemed to think the enterprise beset with such danger\u2014the\r\nhour so untimely, the alley so strictly secluded\u2014often, you said, haunted by\r\nthat dragon, the English teacher\u2014une v\u00e9ritable b\u00e9gueule Britannique \u00e0 ce que\r\nvous dites\u2014esp\u00e8ce de monstre, brusque et rude comme un vieux caporal de\r\ngrenadiers, et rev\u00eache comme une religieuse\u201d (the reader will excuse my modesty\r\nin allowing this flattering sketch of my amiable self to retain the slight veil\r\nof the original tongue). \u201cYou are aware,\u201d went on this precious effusion, \u201cthat\r\nlittle Gustave, on account of his illness, has been removed to a master\u2019s\r\nchamber\u2014that favoured chamber, whose lattice overlooks your prison-ground.\r\nThere, I, the best uncle in the world, am admitted to visit him. How\r\ntremblingly I approached the window and glanced into your Eden\u2014an Eden for me,\r\nthough a desert for you!\u2014how I feared to behold vacancy, or the dragon\r\naforesaid! How my heart palpitated with delight when, through apertures in the\r\nenvious boughs, I at once caught the gleam of your graceful straw-hat, and the\r\nwaving of your grey dress\u2014dress that I should recognise amongst a thousand. But\r\nwhy, my angel, will you not look up? Cruel, to deny me one ray of those\r\nadorable eyes!\u2014how a single glance would have revived me! I write this in fiery\r\nhaste; while the physician examines Gustave, I snatch an opportunity to enclose\r\nit in a small casket, together with a bouquet of flowers, the sweetest that\r\nblow\u2014yet less sweet than thee, my Peri\u2014my all-charming! ever thine-thou well\r\nknowest whom!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish I did know whom,\u201d was my comment; and the wish bore even closer\r\nreference to the person addressed in this choice document, than to the writer\r\nthereof. Perhaps it was from the fianc\u00e9 of one of the engaged pupils; and, in\r\nthat case, there was no great harm done or intended\u2014only a small irregularity.\r\nSeveral of the girls, the majority, indeed, had brothers or cousins at the\r\nneighbouring college. But \u201cla robe grise, le chapeau de paille,\u201d here surely\r\nwas a clue\u2014a very confusing one. The straw-hat was an ordinary garden\r\nhead-screen, common to a score besides myself. The grey dress hardly gave more\r\ndefinite indication. Madame Beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress just now;\r\nanother teacher, and three of the pensionnaires, had had grey dresses purchased\r\nof the same shade and fabric as mine: it was a sort of every-day wear which\r\nhappened at that time to be in vogue.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, as I pondered, I knew I must go in. Lights, moving in the dormitory,\r\nannounced that prayers were over, and the pupils going to bed. Another\r\nhalf-hour and all doors would be locked\u2014all lights extinguished. The front door\r\nyet stood open, to admit into the heated house the coolness of the summer\r\nnight; from the portress\u2019s cabinet close by shone a lamp, showing the long\r\nvestibule with the two-leaved drawing-room doors on one side, the great\r\nstreet-door closing the vista.\r\n\n\r\nAll at once, quick rang the bell\u2014quick, but not loud\u2014a cautious tinkle\u2014a sort\r\nof warning metal whisper. Rosine darted from her cabinet and ran to open. The\r\nperson she admitted stood with her two minutes in parley: there seemed a demur,\r\na delay. Rosine came to the garden door, lamp in hand; she stood on the steps,\r\nlifting her lamp, looking round vaguely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel conte!\u201d she cried, with a coquettish laugh. \u201cPersonne n\u2019y a \u00e9t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me pass,\u201d pleaded a voice I knew: \u201cI ask but five minutes;\u201d and a familiar\r\nshape, tall and grand (as we of the Rue Fossette all thought it), issued from\r\nthe house, and strode down amongst the beds and walks. It was sacrilege\u2014the\r\nintrusion of a man into that spot, at that hour; but he knew himself\r\nprivileged, and perhaps he trusted to the friendly night. He wandered down the\r\nalleys, looking on this side and on that\u2014he was lost in the shrubs, trampling\r\nflowers and breaking branches in his search\u2014he penetrated at last the\r\n\u201cforbidden walk.\u201d There I met him, like some ghost, I suppose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John! it is found.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe did not ask by whom, for with his quick eye he perceived that I held it in\r\nmy hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not betray her,\u201d he said, looking at me as if I were indeed a dragon.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere I ever so disposed to treachery, I cannot betray what I do not know,\u201d was\r\nmy answer. \u201cRead the note, and you will see how little it reveals.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you have read it,\u201d I thought to myself; and yet I could not believe he\r\nwrote it: that could hardly be his style: besides, I was fool enough to think\r\nthere would be a degree of hardship in his calling me such names. His own look\r\nvindicated him; he grew hot, and coloured as he read.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed too much: this is cruel, this is humiliating,\u201d were the words\r\nthat fell from him.\r\n\n\r\nI thought it was cruel, when I saw his countenance so moved. No matter\r\nwhether he was to blame or not; somebody, it seemed to me, must be more to\r\nblame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall you do about it?\u201d he inquired of me. \u201cShall you tell Madame Beck\r\nwhat you have found, and cause a stir\u2014an esclandre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I ought to tell, and said so; adding that I did not believe there\r\nwould be either stir or esclandre: Madame was much too prudent to make a noise\r\nabout an affair of that sort connected with her establishment.\r\n\n\r\nHe stood looking down and meditating. He was both too proud and too honourable\r\nto entreat my secresy on a point which duty evidently commanded me to\r\ncommunicate. I wished to do right, yet loathed to grieve or injure him. Just\r\nthen Rosine glanced out through the open door; she could not see us, though\r\nbetween the trees I could plainly see her: her dress was grey, like mine. This\r\ncircumstance, taken in connection with prior transactions, suggested to me that\r\nperhaps the case, however deplorable, was one in which I was under no\r\nobligation whatever to concern myself. Accordingly, I said,\u2014\u201cIf you can assure\r\nme that none of Madame Beck\u2019s pupils are implicated in this business, I shall\r\nbe very happy to stand aloof from all interference. Take the casket, the\r\nbouquet, and the billet; for my part, I gladly forget the whole affair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d he whispered suddenly, as his hand closed on what I offered, and\r\nat the same time he pointed through the boughs.\r\n\n\r\nI looked. Behold Madame, in shawl, wrapping-gown, and slippers, softly\r\ndescending the steps, and stealing like a cat round the garden: in two minutes\r\nshe would have been upon Dr. John. If she were like a cat, however,\r\nhe, quite as much, resembled a leopard: nothing could be lighter than\r\nhis tread when he chose. He watched, and as she turned a corner, he took the\r\ngarden at two noiseless bounds. She reappeared, and he was gone. Rosine helped\r\nhim, instantly interposing the door between him and his huntress. I, too, might\r\nhave got away, but I preferred to meet Madame openly.\r\n\n\r\nThough it was my frequent and well-known custom to spend twilight in the\r\ngarden, yet, never till now, had I remained so late. Full sure was I that\r\nMadame had missed\u2014was come in search of me, and designed now to pounce on the\r\ndefaulter unawares. I expected a reprimand. No. Madame was all goodness. She\r\ntendered not even a remonstrance; she testified no shade of surprise. With that\r\nconsummate tact of hers, in which I believe she was never surpassed by living\r\nthing, she even professed merely to have issued forth to taste \u201cla brise du\r\nsoir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuelle belle nuit!\u201d cried she, looking up at the stars\u2014the moon was now gone\r\ndown behind the broad tower of Jean Baptiste. \u201cQu\u2019il fait bon? que l\u2019air est\r\nfrais!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd, instead of sending me in, she detained me to take a few turns with her\r\ndown the principal alley. When at last we both re-entered, she leaned affably\r\non my shoulder by way of support in mounting the front-door steps; at parting,\r\nher cheek was presented to my lips, and \u201cBon soir, my bonne amie; dormez bien!\u201d\r\nwas her kindly adieu for the night.\r\n\n\r\nI caught myself smiling as I lay awake and thoughtful on my couch\u2014smiling at\r\nMadame. The unction, the suavity of her behaviour offered, for one who knew\r\nher, a sure token that suspicion of some kind was busy in her brain. From some\r\naperture or summit of observation, through parted bough or open window, she had\r\ndoubtless caught a glimpse, remote or near, deceptive or instructive, of that\r\nnight\u2019s transactions. Finely accomplished as she was in the art of\r\nsurveillance, it was next to impossible that a casket could be thrown into her\r\ngarden, or an interloper could cross her walks to seek it, without that she, in\r\nshaken branch, passing shade, unwonted footfall, or stilly murmur (and though\r\nDr. John had spoken very low in the few words he dropped me, yet the hum of his\r\nman\u2019s voice pervaded, I thought, the whole conventual ground)\u2014without, I say,\r\nthat she should have caught intimation of things extraordinary transpiring on\r\nher premises. What things, she might by no means see, or at that time be\r\nable to discover; but a delicious little ravelled plot lay tempting her to\r\ndisentanglement; and in the midst, folded round and round in cobwebs, had she\r\nnot secured \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d clumsily involved, like the foolish fly she was?\r\n\n"}
{"14": "\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON.\n\r\nI had occasion to smile\u2014nay, to laugh, at Madame again, within the space of\r\nfour and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the last chapter.\r\n\n\r\nVillette owns a climate as variable, though not so humid, as that of any\r\nEnglish town. A night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset, and all the\r\nnext day was one of dry storm\u2014dark, beclouded, yet rainless,\u2014the streets were\r\ndim with sand and dust, whirled from the boulevards. I know not that even\r\nlovely weather would have tempted me to spend the evening-time of study and\r\nrecreation where I had spent it yesterday. My alley, and, indeed, all the walks\r\nand shrubs in the garden, had acquired a new, but not a pleasant interest;\r\ntheir seclusion was now become precarious; their calm\u2014insecure. That casement\r\nwhich rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked; and\r\nelsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained vision, and the knots in the\r\ntree-boles listened like secret ears. Some plants there were, indeed, trodden\r\ndown by Dr. John in his search, and his hasty and heedless progress, which I\r\nwished to prop up, water, and revive; some footmarks, too, he had left on the\r\nbeds: but these, in spite of the strong wind, I found a moment\u2019s leisure to\r\nefface very early in the morning, ere common eyes had discovered them. With a\r\npensive sort of content, I sat down to my desk and my German, while the pupils\r\nsettled to their evening lessons; and the other teachers took up their\r\nneedlework.\r\n\n\r\nThe scene of the \u201cetude du soir\u201d was always the refectory, a much smaller\r\napartment than any of the three classes or schoolrooms; for here none, save the\r\nboarders, were ever admitted, and these numbered only a score. Two lamps hung\r\nfrom the ceiling over the two tables; these were lit at dusk, and their\r\nkindling was the signal for school-books being set aside, a grave demeanour\r\nassumed, general silence enforced, and then commenced \u201cla lecture pieuse.\u201d This\r\nsaid \u201clecture pieuse\u201d was, I soon found, mainly designed as a wholesome\r\nmortification of the Intellect, a useful humiliation of the Reason; and such a\r\ndose for Common Sense as she might digest at her leisure, and thrive on as she\r\nbest could.\r\n\n\r\nThe book brought out (it was never changed, but when finished, recommenced) was\r\na venerable volume, old as the hills\u2014grey as the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\r\n\n\r\nI would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my\r\nhands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and\r\nperusing with my own eyes the enormous figments which, as an unworthy heretic,\r\nit was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears. This book\r\ncontained legends of the saints. Good God! (I speak the words reverently) what\r\nlegends they were. What gasconading rascals those saints must have been, if\r\nthey first boasted these exploits or invented these miracles. These legends,\r\nhowever, were no more than monkish extravagances, over which one laughed\r\ninwardly; there were, besides, priestly matters, and the priestcraft of the\r\nbook was far worse than its monkery. The ears burned on each side of my head as\r\nI listened, perforce, to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by Rome; the dread\r\nboasts of confessors, who had wickedly abused their office, trampling to deep\r\ndegradation high-born ladies, making of countesses and princesses the most\r\ntormented slaves under the sun. Stories like that of Conrad and Elizabeth of\r\nHungary, recurred again and again, with all its dreadful viciousness, sickening\r\ntyranny and black impiety: tales that were nightmares of oppression, privation,\r\nand agony.\r\n\n\r\nI sat out this \u201clecture pieuse\u201d for some nights as well as I could, and as\r\nquietly too; only once breaking off the points of my scissors by involuntarily\r\nsticking them somewhat deep in the worm-eaten board of the table before me.\r\nBut, at last, it made me so burning hot, and my temples, and my heart, and my\r\nwrist throbbed so fast, and my sleep afterwards was so broken with excitement,\r\nthat I could sit no longer. Prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance\r\nof my person from the place, the moment that guilty old book was brought out.\r\nNo Mause Headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against\r\nSergeant Bothwell, than I\u2014to speak my mind in this matter of the popish\r\n\u201clecture pieuse.\u201d However, I did manage somehow to curb and rein in; and though\r\nalways, as soon as Rosine came to light the lamps, I shot from the room\r\nquickly, yet also I did it quietly; seizing that vantage moment given by the\r\nlittle bustle before the dead silence, and vanishing whilst the boarders put\r\ntheir books away.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I vanished\u2014it was into darkness; candles were not allowed to be carried\r\nabout, and the teacher who forsook the refectory, had only the unlit hall,\r\nschoolroom, or bedroom, as a refuge. In winter I sought the long classes, and\r\npaced them fast to keep myself warm\u2014fortunate if the moon shone, and if there\r\nwere only stars, soon reconciled to their dim gleam, or even to the total\r\neclipse of their absence. In summer it was never quite dark, and then I went\r\nup-stairs to my own quarter of the long dormitory, opened my own casement (that\r\nchamber was lit by five casements large as great doors), and leaning out,\r\nlooked forth upon the city beyond the garden, and listened to band-music from\r\nthe park or the palace-square, thinking meantime my own thoughts, living my own\r\nlife, in my own still, shadow-world.\r\n\n\r\nThis evening, fugitive as usual before the Pope and his works, I mounted the\r\nstaircase, approached the dormitory, and quietly opened the door, which was\r\nalways kept carefully shut, and which, like every other door in this house,\r\nrevolved noiselessly on well-oiled hinges. Before I saw, I felt\r\nthat life was in the great room, usually void: not that there was either stir\r\nor breath, or rustle of sound, but Vacuum lacked, Solitude was not at home. All\r\nthe white beds\u2014the \u201clits d\u2019ange,\u201d as they were poetically termed\u2014lay visible at\r\na glance; all were empty: no sleeper reposed therein. The sound of a drawer\r\ncautiously slid out struck my ear; stepping a little to one side, my vision\r\ntook a free range, unimpeded by falling curtains. I now commanded my own bed\r\nand my own toilet, with a locked work-box upon it, and locked drawers\r\nunderneath.\r\n\n\r\nVery good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent shawl and the cleanest of\r\npossible nightcaps, stood before this toilet, hard at work apparently doing me\r\nthe kindness of \u201ctidying out\u201d the \u201cmeuble.\u201d Open stood the lid of the work-box,\r\nopen the top drawer; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in\r\nturn: not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded, not a paper\r\nbut was glanced over, not a little box but was unlidded; and beautiful was the\r\nadroitness, exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished. Madame\r\nwrought at it like a true star, \u201cunhasting yet unresting.\u201d I will not deny that\r\nit was with a secret glee I watched her. Had I been a gentleman I believe\r\nMadame would have found favour in my eyes, she was so handy, neat, thorough in\r\nall she did: some people\u2019s movements provoke the soul by their loose\r\nawkwardness, hers\u2014satisfied by their trim compactness. I stood, in short,\r\nfascinated; but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell, a\r\nretreat must be beaten. The searcher might have turned and caught me; there\r\nwould have been nothing for it then but a scene, and she and I would have had\r\nto come all at once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough knowledge of each\r\nother: down would have gone conventionalities, away swept disguises, and\r\nI should have looked into her eyes, and she into mine\u2014we should have\r\nknown that we could work together no more, and parted in this life for ever.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was the use of tempting such a catastrophe? I was not angry, and had no\r\nwish in the world to leave her. I could hardly get another employer whose yoke\r\nwould be so light and so easy of carriage; and truly I liked Madame for her\r\ncapital sense, whatever I might think of her principles: as to her system, it\r\ndid me no harm; she might work me with it to her heart\u2019s content: nothing would\r\ncome of the operation. Loverless and inexpectant of love, I was as safe from\r\nspies in my heart-poverty, as the beggar from thieves in his destitution of\r\npurse. I turned, then, and fled; descending the stairs with progress as swift\r\nand soundless as that of the spider, which at the same instant ran down the\r\nbannister.\r\n\n\r\nHow I laughed when I reached the schoolroom. I knew now she had certainly seen\r\nDr. John in the garden; I knew what her thoughts were. The spectacle of a\r\nsuspicious nature so far misled by its own inventions, tickled me much. Yet as\r\nthe laugh died, a kind of wrath smote me, and then bitterness followed: it was\r\nthe rock struck, and Meribah\u2019s waters gushing out. I never had felt so strange\r\nand contradictory an inward tumult as I felt for an hour that evening: soreness\r\nand laughter, and fire, and grief, shared my heart between them. I cried hot\r\ntears: not because Madame mistrusted me\u2014I did not care twopence for her\r\nmistrust\u2014but for other reasons. Complicated, disquieting thoughts broke up the\r\nwhole repose of my nature. However, that turmoil subsided: next day I was again\r\nLucy Snowe.\r\n\n\r\nOn revisiting my drawers, I found them all securely locked; the closest\r\nsubsequent examination could not discover change or apparent disturbance in the\r\nposition of one object. My few dresses were folded as I had left them; a\r\ncertain little bunch of white violets that had once been silently presented to\r\nme by a stranger (a stranger to me, for we had never exchanged words), and\r\nwhich I had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds of my best\r\ndress, lay there unstirred; my black silk scarf, my lace chemisette and\r\ncollars, were unrumpled. Had she creased one solitary article, I own I should\r\nhave felt much greater difficulty in forgiving her; but finding all straight\r\nand orderly, I said, \u201cLet bygones be bygones. I am unharmed: why should I bear\r\nmalice?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA thing there was which puzzled myself, and I sought in my brain a key to that\r\nriddle almost as sedulously as Madame had sought a guide to useful knowledge in\r\nmy toilet drawers. How was it that Dr. John, if he had not been accessory to\r\nthe dropping of that casket into the garden, should have known that it\r\nwas dropped, and appeared so promptly on the spot to seek it? So strong\r\nwas the wish to clear up this point that I began to entertain this daring\r\nsuggestion: \u201cWhy may I not, in case I should ever have the opportunity, ask Dr.\r\nJohn himself to explain this coincidence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so long as Dr. John was absent, I really believed I had courage to test him\r\nwith such a question.\r\n\n\r\nLittle Georgette was now convalescent; and her physician accordingly made his\r\nvisits very rare: indeed, he would have ceased them altogether, had not Madame\r\ninsisted on his giving an occasional call till the child should be quite well.\r\n\n\r\nShe came into the nursery one evening just after I had listened to Georgette\u2019s\r\nlisped and broken prayer, and had put her to bed. Taking the little one\u2019s hand,\r\nshe said, \u201cCette enfant a toujours un peu de fi\u00e8vre.\u201d And presently afterwards,\r\nlooking at me with a quicker glance than was habitual to her quiet eye, \u201cLe\r\nDocteur John l\u2019a-t-il vue derni\u00e8rement? Non, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course she knew this better than any other person in the house. \u201cWell,\u201d she\r\ncontinued, \u201cI am going out, pour faire quelques courses en fiacre. I shall call\r\non Dr. John, and send him to the child. I will that he sees her this evening;\r\nher cheeks are flushed, her pulse is quick; you will receive him\u2014for my\r\npart, I shall be from home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow the child was well enough, only warm with the warmth of July; it was\r\nscarcely less needful to send for a priest to administer extreme unction than\r\nfor a doctor to prescribe a dose; also Madame rarely made \u201ccourses,\u201d as she\r\ncalled them, in the evening: moreover, this was the first time she had chosen\r\nto absent herself on the occasion of a visit from Dr. John. The whole\r\narrangement indicated some plan; this I saw, but without the least anxiety.\r\n\u201cHa! ha! Madame,\u201d laughed Light-heart the Beggar, \u201cyour crafty wits are on the\r\nwrong tack.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe departed, attired very smartly, in a shawl of price, and a certain\r\nchapeau vert tendre\u2014hazardous, as to its tint, for any complexion less\r\nfresh than her own, but, to her, not unbecoming. I wondered what she intended:\r\nwhether she really would send Dr. John or not; or whether indeed he would come:\r\nhe might be engaged.\r\n\n\r\nMadame had charged me not to let Georgette sleep till the doctor came; I had\r\ntherefore sufficient occupation in telling her nursery tales and palavering the\r\nlittle language for her benefit. I affected Georgette; she was a sensitive and\r\na loving child: to hold her in my lap, or carry her in my arms, was to me a\r\ntreat. To-night she would have me lay my head on the pillow of her crib; she\r\neven put her little arms round my neck. Her clasp, and the nestling action with\r\nwhich she pressed her cheek to mine, made me almost cry with a tender pain.\r\nFeeling of no kind abounded in that house; this pure little drop from a pure\r\nlittle source was too sweet: it penetrated deep, and subdued the heart, and\r\nsent a gush to the eyes. Half an hour or an hour passed; Georgette murmured in\r\nher soft lisp that she was growing sleepy. \u201cAnd you shall sleep,\u201d\r\nthought I, \u201cmalgr\u00e9 maman and m\u00e9decin, if they are not here in ten minutes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHark! There was the ring, and there the tread, astonishing the staircase by the\r\nfleetness with which it left the steps behind. Rosine introduced Dr. John, and,\r\nwith a freedom of manner not altogether peculiar to herself, but characteristic\r\nof the domestics of Villette generally, she stayed to hear what he had to say.\r\nMadame\u2019s presence would have awed her back to her own realm of the vestibule\r\nand the cabinet\u2014for mine, or that of any other teacher or pupil, she cared not\r\na jot. Smart, trim and pert, she stood, a hand in each pocket of her gay\r\ngrisette apron, eyeing Dr. John with no more fear or shyness than if he had\r\nbeen a picture instead of a living gentleman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLe marmot n\u2019a rien n\u2019est ce pas?\u201d said she, indicating Georgette with a jerk\r\nof her chin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPas beaucoup,\u201d was the answer, as the doctor hastily scribbled with his pencil\r\nsome harmless prescription.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien!\u201d pursued Rosine, approaching him quite near, while he put up his\r\npencil. \u201cAnd the box\u2014did you get it? Monsieur went off like a coup-de-vent the\r\nother night; I had not time to ask him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI found it: yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who threw it, then?\u201d continued Rosine, speaking quite freely the very\r\nwords I should so much have wished to say, but had no address or courage to\r\nbring it out: how short some people make the road to a point which, for others,\r\nseems unattainable!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat may be my secret,\u201d rejoined Dr. John briefly, but with no sort of\r\nhauteur: he seemed quite to understand the Rosine or grisette character.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais enfin,\u201d continued she, nothing abashed, \u201cmonsieur knew it was thrown,\r\nsince he came to seek it\u2014how did he know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was attending a little patient in the college near,\u201d said he, \u201cand saw it\r\ndropped out of his chamber window, and so came to pick it up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow simple the whole explanation! The note had alluded to a physician as then\r\nexamining \u201cGustave.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh \u00e7a!\u201d pursued Rosine; \u201cil n\u2019y a donc rien l\u00e0-dessous: pas de myst\u00e8re, pas\r\nd\u2019amourette, par exemple?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPas plus que sur ma main,\u201d responded the doctor, showing his palm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel dommage!\u201d responded the grisette: \u201cet moi\u2014\u00e0 qui tout cela commen\u00e7ait \u00e0\r\ndonner des id\u00e9es.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVraiment! vous en \u00eates pour vos frais,\u201d was the doctor\u2019s cool rejoinder.\r\n\n\r\nShe pouted. The doctor could not help laughing at the sort of \u201cmoue\u201d she made:\r\nwhen he laughed, he had something peculiarly good-natured and genial in his\r\nlook. I saw his hand incline to his pocket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow many times have you opened the door for me within this last month?\u201d he\r\nasked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur ought to have kept count of that,\u201d said Rosine, quite readily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if I had not something better to do!\u201d rejoined he; but I saw him give her a\r\npiece of gold, which she took unscrupulously, and then danced off to answer the\r\ndoor-bell, ringing just now every five minutes, as the various servants came to\r\nfetch the half-boarders.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader must not think too hardly of Rosine; on the whole, she was not a bad\r\nsort of person, and had no idea there could be any disgrace in grasping at\r\nwhatever she could get, or any effrontery in chattering like a pie to the best\r\ngentleman in Christendom.\r\n\n\r\nI had learnt something from the above scene besides what concerned the ivory\r\nbox: viz., that not on the robe de jaconas, pink or grey, nor yet on the\r\nfrilled and pocketed apron, lay the blame of breaking Dr. John\u2019s heart: these\r\nitems of array were obviously guiltless as Georgette\u2019s little blue tunic. So\r\nmuch the better. But who then was the culprit? What was the ground\u2014what the\r\norigin\u2014what the perfect explanation of the whole business? Some points had been\r\ncleared, but how many yet remained obscure as night!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cit is no affair of yours;\u201d and turning from the\r\nface on which I had been unconsciously dwelling with a questioning gaze, I\r\nlooked through the window which commanded the garden below. Dr. John, meantime,\r\nstanding by the bed-side, was slowly drawing on his gloves and watching his\r\nlittle patient, as her eyes closed and her rosy lips parted in coming sleep. I\r\nwaited till he should depart as usual, with a quick bow and scarce articulate\r\n\u201cgood-night.\u201d. Just as he took his hat, my eyes, fixed on the tall houses\r\nbounding the garden, saw the one lattice, already commemorated, cautiously\r\nopen; forth from the aperture projected a hand and a white handkerchief; both\r\nwaved. I know not whether the signal was answered from some viewless quarter of\r\nour own dwelling; but immediately after there fluttered from the lattice a\r\nfalling object, white and light\u2014billet the second, of course.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d I ejaculated involuntarily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d, asked Dr. John with energy, making direct for the window. \u201cWhat, is\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have gone and done it again,\u201d was my reply. \u201cA handkerchief waved and\r\nsomething fell:\u201d and I pointed to the lattice, now closed and looking\r\nhypocritically blank.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo, at once; pick it up and bring it here,\u201d was his prompt direction; adding,\r\n\u201cNobody will take notice of you: I should be seen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStraight I went. After some little search, I found a folded paper, lodged on\r\nthe lower branch of a shrub; I seized and brought it direct to Dr. John. This\r\ntime, I believe not even Rosine saw me.\r\n\n\r\nHe instantly tore the billet into small pieces, without reading it. \u201cIt is not\r\nin the least her fault, you must remember,\u201d he said, looking at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhose fault?\u201d I asked. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t yet know, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you no guess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I knew you better, I might be tempted to risk some confidence, and thus\r\nsecure you as guardian over a most innocent and excellent, but somewhat\r\ninexperienced being.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs a duenna?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he abstractedly. \u201cWhat snares are round her!\u201d he added, musingly:\r\nand now, certainly for the first time, he examined my face, anxious, doubtless,\r\nto see if any kindly expression there, would warrant him in recommending to my\r\ncare and indulgence some ethereal creature, against whom powers of darkness\r\nwere plotting. I felt no particular vocation to undertake the surveillance of\r\nethereal creatures; but recalling the scene at the bureau, it seemed to me that\r\nI owed him a good turn: if I could help him then I would, and it\r\nlay not with me to decide how. With as little reluctance as might be, I\r\nintimated that \u201cI was willing to do what I could towards taking care of any\r\nperson in whom he might be interested.\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no farther interested than as a spectator,\u201d said he, with a modesty,\r\nadmirable, as I thought, to witness. \u201cI happen to be acquainted with the rather\r\nworthless character of the person, who, from the house opposite, has now twice\r\ninvaded the sanctity of this place; I have also met in society the object at\r\nwhom these vulgar attempts are aimed. Her exquisite superiority and innate\r\nrefinement ought, one would think, to scare impertinence from her very idea. It\r\nis not so, however; and innocent, unsuspicious as she is, I would guard her\r\nfrom evil if I could. In person, however, I can do nothing, I cannot come near\r\nher\u201d\u2014he paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I am willing to help you,\u201d said I, \u201conly tell me how.\u201d And busily, in my\r\nown mind, I ran over the list of our inmates, seeking this paragon, this pearl\r\nof great price, this gem without flaw. \u201cIt must be Madame,\u201d I concluded.\r\n\u201cShe only, amongst us all, has the art even to seem superior: but\r\nas to being unsuspicious, inexperienced, &c., Dr. John need not distract\r\nhimself about that. However, this is just his whim, and I will not contradict\r\nhim; he shall be humoured: his angel shall be an angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust notify the quarter to which my care is to be directed,\u201d I continued\r\ngravely: chuckling, however, to myself over the thought of being set to\r\nchaperon Madame Beck or any of her pupils. Now Dr. John had a fine set of\r\nnerves, and he at once felt by instinct, what no more coarsely constituted mind\r\nwould have detected; namely, that I was a little amused at him. The colour rose\r\nto his cheek; with half a smile he turned and took his hat\u2014he was going. My\r\nheart smote me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will\u2014I will help you,\u201d said I eagerly. \u201cI will do what you wish. I will\r\nwatch over your angel; I will take care of her, only tell me who she is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you must know,\u201d said he then with earnestness, yet speaking very\r\nlow. \u201cSo spotless, so good, so unspeakably beautiful! impossible that one house\r\nshould contain two like her. I allude, of course\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere the latch of Madame Beck\u2019s chamber-door (opening into the nursery) gave a\r\nsudden click, as if the hand holding it had been slightly convulsed; there was\r\nthe suppressed explosion of an irrepressible sneeze. These little accidents\r\nwill happen to the best of us. Madame\u2014excellent woman! was then on duty. She\r\nhad come home quietly, stolen up-stairs on tip-toe; she was in her chamber. If\r\nshe had not sneezed, she would have heard all, and so should I; but that\r\nunlucky sternutation routed Dr. John. While he stood aghast, she came forward\r\nalert, composed, in the best yet most tranquil spirits: no novice to her habits\r\nbut would have thought she had just come in, and scouted the idea of her ear\r\nhaving been glued to the key-hole for at least ten minutes. She affected to\r\nsneeze again, declared she was \u201cenrhum\u00e9e,\u201d and then proceeded volubly to\r\nrecount her \u201ccourses en fiacre.\u201d The prayer-bell rang, and I left her with the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\n"}
{"15": "\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE F\u00caTE.\n\r\nAs soon as Georgette was well, Madame sent her away into the country. I was\r\nsorry; I loved the child, and her loss made me poorer than before. But I must\r\nnot complain. I lived in a house full of robust life; I might have had\r\ncompanions, and I chose solitude. Each of the teachers in turn made me\r\novertures of special intimacy; I tried them all. One I found to be an honest\r\nwoman, but a narrow thinker, a coarse feeler, and an egotist. The second was a\r\nParisienne, externally refined\u2014at heart, corrupt\u2014without a creed, without a\r\nprinciple, without an affection: having penetrated the outward crust of decorum\r\nin this character, you found a slough beneath. She had a wonderful passion for\r\npresents; and, in this point, the third teacher\u2014a person otherwise\r\ncharacterless and insignificant\u2014closely resembled her. This last-named had also\r\none other distinctive property\u2014that of avarice. In her reigned the love of\r\nmoney for its own sake. The sight of a piece of gold would bring into her eyes\r\na green glisten, singular to witness. She once, as a mark of high favour, took\r\nme up-stairs, and, opening a secret door, showed me a hoard\u2014a mass of coarse,\r\nlarge coin\u2014about fifteen guineas, in five-franc pieces. She loved this hoard as\r\na bird loves its eggs. These were her savings. She would come and talk to me\r\nabout them with an infatuated and persevering dotage, strange to behold in a\r\nperson not yet twenty-five.\r\n\n\r\nThe Parisienne, on the other hand, was prodigal and profligate (in disposition,\r\nthat is: as to action, I do not know). That latter quality showed its\r\nsnake-head to me but once, peeping out very cautiously. A curious kind of\r\nreptile it seemed, judging from the glimpse I got; its novelty whetted my\r\ncuriosity: if it would have come out boldly, perhaps I might philosophically\r\nhave stood my ground, and coolly surveyed the long thing from forked tongue to\r\nscaly tail-tip; but it merely rustled in the leaves of a bad novel; and, on\r\nencountering a hasty and ill-advised demonstration of wrath, recoiled and\r\nvanished, hissing. She hated me from that day.\r\n\n\r\nThis Parisienne was always in debt; her salary being anticipated, not only in\r\ndress, but in perfumes, cosmetics, confectionery, and condiments. What a cold,\r\ncallous epicure she was in all things! I see her now. Thin in face and figure,\r\nsallow in complexion, regular in features, with perfect teeth, lips like a\r\nthread, a large, prominent chin, a well-opened, but frozen eye, of light at\r\nonce craving and ingrate. She mortally hated work, and loved what she called\r\npleasure; being an insipid, heartless, brainless dissipation of time.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck knew this woman\u2019s character perfectly well. She once talked to me\r\nabout her, with an odd mixture of discrimination, indifference, and antipathy.\r\nI asked why she kept her in the establishment. She answered plainly, \u201cbecause\r\nit suited her interest to do so;\u201d and pointed out a fact I had already noticed,\r\nnamely, that Mademoiselle St. Pierre possessed, in an almost unique degree, the\r\npower of keeping order amongst her undisciplined ranks of scholars. A certain\r\npetrifying influence accompanied and surrounded her: without passion, noise, or\r\nviolence, she held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might still a\r\nbrawling stream. She was of little use as far as communication of knowledge\r\nwent, but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules she was invaluable.\r\n\u201cJe sais bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas de principes, ni, peut-\u00eatre, de moeurs,\u201d admitted\r\nMadame frankly; but added with philosophy, \u201cson maintien en classe est toujours\r\nconvenable et rempli m\u00eame d\u2019une certaine dignit\u00e9: c\u2019est tout ce qu\u2019il faut. Ni\r\nles \u00e9l\u00e8ves ni les parents ne regardent plus loin; ni, par cons\u00e9quent, moi non\r\nplus.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA strange, frolicsome, noisy little world was this school: great pains were\r\ntaken to hide chains with flowers: a subtle essence of Romanism pervaded every\r\narrangement: large sensual indulgence (so to speak) was permitted by way of\r\ncounterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint. Each mind was being reared in\r\nslavery; but, to prevent reflection from dwelling on this fact, every pretext\r\nfor physical recreation was seized and made the most of. There, as elsewhere,\r\nthe CHURCH strove to bring up her children robust in body, feeble in soul, fat,\r\nruddy, hale, joyous, ignorant, unthinking, unquestioning. \u201cEat, drink, and\r\nlive!\u201d she says. \u201cLook after your bodies; leave your souls to me. I hold their\r\ncure\u2014guide their course: I guarantee their final fate.\u201d A bargain, in which\r\nevery true Catholic deems himself a gainer. Lucifer just offers the same terms:\r\n\u201cAll this power will I give thee, and the glory of it; for that is delivered\r\nunto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship\r\nme, all shall be thine!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAbout this time\u2014in the ripest glow of summer\u2014Madame Beck\u2019s house became as\r\nmerry a place as a school could well be. All day long the broad folding-doors\r\nand the two-leaved casements stood wide open: settled sunshine seemed\r\nnaturalized in the atmosphere; clouds were far off, sailing away beyond sea,\r\nresting, no doubt, round islands such as England\u2014that dear land of mists\u2014but\r\nwithdrawn wholly from the drier continent. We lived far more in the garden than\r\nunder a roof: classes were held, and meals partaken of, in the \u201cgrand berceau.\u201d\r\nMoreover, there was a note of holiday preparation, which almost turned freedom\r\ninto licence. The autumnal long vacation was but two months distant; but before\r\nthat, a great day\u2014an important ceremony\u2014none other than the f\u00eate of\r\nMadame\u2014awaited celebration.\r\n\n\r\nThe conduct of this f\u00eate devolved chiefly on Mademoiselle St. Pierre: Madame\r\nherself being supposed to stand aloof, disinterestedly unconscious of what\r\nmight be going forward in her honour. Especially, she never knew, never in the\r\nleast suspected, that a subscription was annually levied on the whole school\r\nfor the purchase of a handsome present. The polite tact of the reader will\r\nplease to leave out of the account a brief, secret consultation on this point\r\nin Madame\u2019s own chamber.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you have this year?\u201d was asked by her Parisian lieutenant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no matter! Let it alone. Let the poor children keep their francs,\u201d And\r\nMadame looked benign and modest.\r\n\n\r\nThe St. Pierre would here protrude her chin; she knew Madame by heart; she\r\nalways called her airs of \u201cbont\u00e9\u201d\u2014\u201cdes grimaces.\u201d She never even professed to\r\nrespect them one instant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVite!\u201d she would say coldly. \u201cName the article. Shall it be jewellery or\r\nporcelain, haberdashery or silver?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien! Deux ou trois cuillers, et autant de fourchettes en argent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the result was a handsome case, containing 300 francs worth of plate.\r\n\n\r\nThe programme of the f\u00eate-day\u2019s proceedings comprised: Presentation of plate,\r\ncollation in the garden, dramatic performance (with pupils and teachers for\r\nactors), a dance and supper. Very gorgeous seemed the effect of the whole to\r\nme, as I well remember. Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre understood these things and managed\r\nthem ably.\r\n\n\r\nThe play was the main point; a month\u2019s previous drilling being there required.\r\nThe choice, too, of the actors required knowledge and care; then came lessons\r\nin elocution, in attitude, and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals. For\r\nall this, as may well be supposed, St. Pierre did not suffice: other\r\nmanagement, other accomplishments than hers were requisite here. They were\r\nsupplied in the person of a master\u2014M. Paul Emanuel, professor of literature. It\r\nwas never my lot to be present at the histrionic lessons of M. Paul, but I\r\noften saw him as he crossed the carr\u00e9 (a square hall between the\r\ndwelling-house and school-house). I heard him, too, in the warm evenings,\r\nlecturing with open doors, and his name, with anecdotes of him, resounded in\r\nones ears from all sides. Especially our former acquaintance, Miss Ginevra\r\nFanshawe,\u2014who had been selected to take a prominent part in the play\u2014used, in\r\nbestowing upon me a large portion of her leisure, to lard her discourse with\r\nfrequent allusions to his sayings and doings. She esteemed him hideously plain,\r\nand used to profess herself frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of\r\nhis step or voice. A dark little man he certainly was; pungent and austere.\r\nEven to me he seemed a harsh apparition, with his close-shorn, black head, his\r\nbroad, sallow brow, his thin cheek, his wide and quivering nostril, his\r\nthorough glance, and hurried bearing. Irritable he was; one heard that, as he\r\napostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders. Sometimes he\r\nwould break out on these raw amateur actresses with a passion of impatience at\r\ntheir falseness of conception, their coldness of emotion, their feebleness of\r\ndelivery. \u201cEcoutez!\u201d he would cry; and then his voice rang through the premises\r\nlike a trumpet; and when, mimicking it, came the small pipe of a Ginevra, a\r\nMathilde, or a Blanche, one understood why a hollow groan of scorn, or a fierce\r\nhiss of rage, rewarded the tame echo.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous n\u2019\u00eates donc que des poup\u00e9es,\u201d I heard him thunder. \u201cVous n\u2019avez pas de\r\npassions\u2014vous autres. Vous ne sentez donc rien? Votre chair est de neige, votre\r\nsang de glace! Moi, je veux que tout cela s\u2019allume, qu\u2019il ait une vie, une\r\n\u00e2me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nVain resolve! And when he at last found it was vain, he suddenly broke\r\nthe whole business down. Hitherto he had been teaching them a grand tragedy; he\r\ntore the tragedy in morsels, and came next day with a compact little comic\r\ntrifle. To this they took more kindly; he presently knocked it all into their\r\nsmooth round pates.\r\n\n\r\nMademoiselle St. Pierre always presided at M. Emanuel\u2019s lessons, and I was told\r\nthat the polish of her manner, her seeming attention, her tact and grace,\r\nimpressed that gentleman very favourably. She had, indeed, the art of pleasing,\r\nfor a given time, whom she would; but the feeling would not last: in an hour it\r\nwas dried like dew, vanished like gossamer.\r\n\n\r\nThe day preceding Madame\u2019s f\u00eate was as much a holiday as the f\u00eate itself. It\r\nwas devoted to clearing out, cleaning, arranging and decorating the three\r\nschoolrooms. All within-doors was the gayest bustle; neither up-stairs nor down\r\ncould a quiet, isolated person find rest for the sole of her foot; accordingly,\r\nfor my part, I took refuge in the garden. The whole day did I wander or sit\r\nthere alone, finding warmth in the sun, shelter among the trees, and a sort of\r\ncompanionship in my own thoughts. I well remember that I exchanged but two\r\nsentences that day with any living being: not that I felt solitary; I was glad\r\nto be quiet. For a looker-on, it sufficed to pass through the rooms once or\r\ntwice, observe what changes were being wrought, how a green-room and a\r\ndressing-room were being contrived, a little stage with scenery erected, how M.\r\nPaul Emanuel, in conjunction with Mademoiselle St. Pierre, was directing all,\r\nand how an eager band of pupils, amongst them Ginevra Fanshawe, were working\r\ngaily under his control.\r\n\n\r\nThe great day arrived. The sun rose hot and unclouded, and hot and unclouded it\r\nburned on till evening. All the doors and all the windows were set open, which\r\ngave a pleasant sense of summer freedom\u2014and freedom the most complete seemed\r\nindeed the order of the day. Teachers and pupils descended to breakfast in\r\ndressing-gowns and curl-papers: anticipating \u201cavec d\u00e9lices\u201d the toilette of the\r\nevening, they seemed to take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon in a luxury\r\nof slovenliness; like aldermen fasting in preparation for a feast. About nine\r\no\u2019clock A.M., an important functionary, the \u201ccoiffeur,\u201d arrived. Sacrilegious\r\nto state, he fixed his head-quarters in the oratory, and there, in presence of\r\nb\u00e9nitier, candle, and crucifix, solemnised the mysteries of his art.\r\nEach girl was summoned in turn to pass through his hands; emerging from them\r\nwith head as smooth as a shell, intersected by faultless white lines, and\r\nwreathed about with Grecian plaits that shone as if lacquered. I took my turn\r\nwith the rest, and could hardly believe what the glass said when I applied to\r\nit for information afterwards; the lavished garlandry of woven brown hair\r\namazed me\u2014I feared it was not all my own, and it required several convincing\r\npulls to give assurance to the contrary. I then acknowledged in the coiffeur a\r\nfirst-rate artist\u2014one who certainly made the most of indifferent materials.\r\n\n\r\nThe oratory closed, the dormitory became the scene of ablutions, arrayings and\r\nbedizenings curiously elaborate. To me it was, and ever must be an enigma, how\r\nthey contrived to spend so much time in doing so little. The operation seemed\r\nclose, intricate, prolonged: the result simple. A clear white muslin dress, a\r\nblue sash (the Virgin\u2019s colours), a pair of white, or straw-colour kid\r\ngloves\u2014such was the gala uniform, to the assumption whereof that houseful of\r\nteachers and pupils devoted three mortal hours. But though simple, it must be\r\nallowed the array was perfect\u2014perfect in fashion, fit, and freshness; every\r\nhead being also dressed with exquisite nicety, and a certain compact\r\ntaste\u2014suiting the full, firm comeliness of Labassecourien contours, though too\r\nstiff for any more flowing and flexible style of beauty\u2014the general effect was,\r\non the whole, commendable.\r\n\n\r\nIn beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass, I well remember feeling myself to\r\nbe a mere shadowy spot on a field of light; the courage was not in me to put on\r\na transparent white dress: something thin I must wear\u2014the weather and rooms\r\nbeing too hot to give substantial fabrics sufferance, so I had sought through a\r\ndozen shops till I lit upon a crape-like material of purple-gray\u2014the colour, in\r\nshort, of dun mist, lying on a moor in bloom. My tailleuse had kindly\r\nmade it as well as she could: because, as she judiciously observed, it was \u201csi\r\ntriste\u2014si pen voyant,\u201d care in the fashion was the more imperative: it was well\r\nshe took this view of the matter, for I, had no flower, no jewel to relieve it:\r\nand, what was more, I had no natural rose of complexion.\r\n\n\r\nWe become oblivious of these deficiencies in the uniform routine of daily\r\ndrudgery, but they will force upon us their unwelcome blank on those\r\nbright occasions when beauty should shine.\r\n\n\r\nHowever, in this same gown of shadow, I felt at home and at ease; an advantage\r\nI should not have enjoyed in anything more brilliant or striking. Madame Beck,\r\ntoo, kept me in countenance; her dress was almost as quiet as mine, except that\r\nshe wore a bracelet, and a large brooch bright with gold and fine stones. We\r\nchanced to meet on the stairs, and she gave me a nod and smile of approbation.\r\nNot that she thought I was looking well\u2014a point unlikely to engage her\r\ninterest\u2014but she considered me dressed \u201cconvenablement,\u201d \u201cd\u00e9cemment,\u201d and la\r\nConvenance et la D\u00e9cence were the two calm deities of Madame\u2019s worship. She\r\neven paused, laid on my shoulder her gloved hand, holding an embroidered and\r\nperfumed handkerchief, and confided to my ear a sarcasm on the other teachers\r\n(whom she had just been complimenting to their faces). \u201cNothing so absurd,\u201d she\r\nsaid, \u201cas for des femmes m\u00fbres \u2018to dress themselves like girls of\r\nfifteen\u2019\u2014quant \u00e0 la St. Pierre, elle a l\u2019air d\u2019une vieille coquette qui fait\r\nl\u2019ing\u00e9nue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBeing dressed at least a couple of hours before anybody else, I felt a pleasure\r\nin betaking myself\u2014not to the garden, where servants were busy propping up long\r\ntables, placing seats, and spreading cloths in readiness for the collation but\r\nto the schoolrooms, now empty, quiet, cool, and clean; their walls fresh\r\nstained, their planked floors fresh scoured and scarce dry; flowers fresh\r\ngathered adorning the recesses in pots, and draperies, fresh hung, beautifying\r\nthe great windows.\r\n\n\r\nWithdrawing to the first classe, a smaller and neater room than the others, and\r\ntaking from the glazed bookcase, of which I kept the key, a volume whose title\r\npromised some interest, I sat down to read. The glass-door of this \u201cclasse,\u201d or\r\nschoolroom, opened into the large berceau; acacia-boughs caressed its panes, as\r\nthey stretched across to meet a rose-bush blooming by the opposite lintel: in\r\nthis rose-bush bees murmured busy and happy. I commenced reading. Just as the\r\nstilly hum, the embowering shade, the warm, lonely calm of my retreat were\r\nbeginning to steal meaning from the page, vision from my eyes, and to lure me\r\nalong the track of reverie, down into some deep dell of dreamland\u2014just then,\r\nthe sharpest ring of the street-door bell to which that much-tried instrument\r\nhad ever thrilled, snatched me back to consciousness.\r\n\n\r\nNow the bell had been ringing all the morning, as workmen, or servants, or\r\ncoiffeurs, or tailleuses, went and came on their several errands.\r\nMoreover, there was good reason to expect it would ring all the afternoon,\r\nsince about one hundred externes were yet to arrive in carriages or fiacres:\r\nnor could it be expected to rest during the evening, when parents and friends\r\nwould gather thronging to the play. Under these circumstances, a ring\u2014even a\r\nsharp ring\u2014was a matter of course: yet this particular peal had an accent of\r\nits own, which chased my dream, and startled my book from my knee.\r\n\n\r\nI was stooping to pick up this last, when\u2014firm, fast, straight\u2014right on through\r\nvestibule\u2014along corridor, across carr\u00e9, through first division, second\r\ndivision, grand salle\u2014strode a step, quick, regular, intent. The closed door of\r\nthe first classe\u2014my sanctuary\u2014offered no obstacle; it burst open, and a palet\u00f4t\r\nand a bonnet grec filled the void; also two eyes first vaguely struck upon, and\r\nthen hungrily dived into me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est cela!\u201d said a voice. \u201cJe la connais: c\u2019est l\u2019Anglaise. Tant pis. Toute\r\nAnglaise, et, par cons\u00e9quent, toute b\u00e9gueule qu\u2019elle soit\u2014elle fera mon\r\naffaire, ou je saurai pourquoi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen, with a certain stern politeness (I suppose he thought I had not caught\r\nthe drift of his previous uncivil mutterings), and in a jargon the most\r\nexecrable that ever was heard, \u201cMeess\u2014\u2014, play you must: I am planted there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, M. Paul Emanuel?\u201d I inquired: for M. Paul Emanuel it\r\nwas, and in a state of no little excitement.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlay you must. I will not have you shrink, or frown, or make the prude. I read\r\nyour skull that night you came; I see your moyens: play you can; play you\r\nmust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how, M. Paul? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no time to be lost,\u201d he went on, now speaking in French; \u201cand let us\r\nthrust to the wall all reluctance, all excuses, all minauderies. You must take\r\na part.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the vaudeville?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the vaudeville. You have said it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI gasped, horror-struck. What did the little man mean?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d he said. \u201cThe case shall be stated, and you shall then answer me Yes,\r\nor No; and according to your answer shall I ever after estimate you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe scarce-suppressed impetus of a most irritable nature glowed in his cheek,\r\nfed with sharp shafts his glances, a nature\u2014the injudicious, the mawkish, the\r\nhesitating, the sullen, the affected, above all, the unyielding, might quickly\r\nrender violent and implacable. Silence and attention was the best balm to\r\napply: I listened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe whole matter is going to fail,\u201d he began. \u201cLouise Vanderkelkov has fallen\r\nill\u2014at least so her ridiculous mother asserts; for my part, I feel sure she\r\nmight play if she would: it is only good-will that lacks. She was charged with\r\na r\u00f4le, as you know, or do not know\u2014it is equal: without that\r\nr\u00f4le the play is stopped. There are now but a few hours in which to\r\nlearn it: not a girl in this school would hear reason, and accept the task.\r\nForsooth, it is not an interesting, not an amiable, part; their vile\r\namour-propre\u2014that base quality of which women have so much\u2014would revolt\r\nfrom it. Englishwomen are either the best or the worst of their sex. Dieu sait\r\nque je les d\u00e9teste comme la peste, ordinairement\u201d (this between his recreant\r\nteeth). \u201cI apply to an Englishwoman to rescue me. What is her answer\u2014Yes, or\r\nNo?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA thousand objections rushed into my mind. The foreign language, the limited\r\ntime, the public display\u2026 Inclination recoiled, Ability faltered, Self-respect\r\n(that \u201cvile quality\u201d) trembled. \u201cNon, non, non!\u201d said all these; but looking up\r\nat M. Paul, and seeing in his vexed, fiery, and searching eye, a sort of appeal\r\nbehind all its menace, my lips dropped the word \u201coui\u201d. For a moment his rigid\r\ncountenance relaxed with a quiver of content: quickly bent up again, however,\r\nhe went on,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVite \u00e0 l\u2019ouvrage! Here is the book; here is your r\u00f4le: read.\u201d And I\r\nread. He did not commend; at some passages he scowled and stamped. He gave me a\r\nlesson: I diligently imitated. It was a disagreeable part\u2014a man\u2019s\u2014an\r\nempty-headed fop\u2019s. One could put into it neither heart nor soul: I hated it.\r\nThe play\u2014a mere trifle\u2014ran chiefly on the efforts of a brace of rivals to gain\r\nthe hand of a fair coquette. One lover was called the \u201cOurs,\u201d a good and\r\ngallant but unpolished man, a sort of diamond in the rough; the other was a\r\nbutterfly, a talker, and a traitor: and I was to be the butterfly, talker, and\r\ntraitor.\r\n\n\r\nI did my best\u2014which was bad, I know: it provoked M. Paul; he fumed. Putting\r\nboth hands to the work, I endeavoured to do better than my best; I presume he\r\ngave me credit for good intentions; he professed to be partially content. \u201cCa\r\nira!\u201d he cried; and as voices began sounding from the garden, and white dresses\r\nfluttering among the trees, he added: \u201cYou must withdraw: you must be alone to\r\nlearn this. Come with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout being allowed time or power to deliberate, I found myself in the same\r\nbreath convoyed along as in a species of whirlwind, up-stairs, up two pair of\r\nstairs, nay, actually up three (for this fiery little man seemed as by instinct\r\nto know his way everywhere); to the solitary and lofty attic was I borne, put\r\nin and locked in, the key being, in the door, and that key he took with him and\r\nvanished.\r\n\n\r\nThe attic was no pleasant place: I believe he did not know how unpleasant it\r\nwas, or he never would have locked me in with so little ceremony. In this\r\nsummer weather, it was hot as Africa; as in winter, it was always cold as\r\nGreenland. Boxes and lumber filled it; old dresses draped its unstained\r\nwall\u2014cobwebs its unswept ceiling. Well was it known to be tenanted by rats, by\r\nblack beetles, and by cockroaches\u2014nay, rumour affirmed that the ghostly Nun of\r\nthe garden had once been seen here. A partial darkness obscured one end, across\r\nwhich, as for deeper mystery, an old russet curtain was drawn, by way of screen\r\nto a sombre band of winter cloaks, pendent each from its pin, like a malefactor\r\nfrom his gibbet. From amongst these cloaks, and behind that curtain, the Nun\r\nwas said to issue. I did not believe this, nor was I troubled by apprehension\r\nthereof; but I saw a very dark and large rat, with a long tail, come gliding\r\nout from that squalid alcove; and, moreover, my eye fell on many a\r\nblack-beetle, dotting the floor. These objects discomposed me more, perhaps,\r\nthan it would be wise to say, as also did the dust, lumber, and stifling heat\r\nof the place. The last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable, had I\r\nnot found means to open and prop up the skylight, thus admitting some\r\nfreshness. Underneath this aperture I pushed a large empty chest, and having\r\nmounted upon it a smaller box, and wiped from both the dust, I gathered my\r\ndress (my best, the reader must remember, and therefore a legitimate object of\r\ncare) fastidiously around me, ascended this species of extempore throne, and\r\nbeing seated, commenced the acquisition of my task; while I learned, not\r\nforgetting to keep a sharp look-out on the black-beetles and cockroaches, of\r\nwhich, more even, I believe, than of the rats, I sat in mortal dread.\r\n\n\r\nMy impression at first was that I had undertaken what it really was impossible\r\nto perform, and I simply resolved to do my best and be resigned to fail. I soon\r\nfound, however, that one part in so short a piece was not more than memory\r\ncould master at a few hours\u2019 notice. I learned and learned on, first in a\r\nwhisper, and then aloud. Perfectly secure from human audience, I acted my part\r\nbefore the garret-vermin. Entering into its emptiness, frivolity, and\r\nfalsehood, with a spirit inspired by scorn and impatience, I took my revenge on\r\nthis \u201cfat,\u201d by making him as fatuitous as I possibly could.\r\n\n\r\nIn this exercise the afternoon passed: day began to glide into evening; and I,\r\nwho had eaten nothing since breakfast, grew excessively hungry. Now I thought\r\nof the collation, which doubtless they were just then devouring in the garden\r\nfar below. (I had seen in the vestibule a basketful of small p\u00e2t\u00e9s \u00e0 la\r\ncr\u00eame, than which nothing in the whole range of cookery seemed to me\r\nbetter). A p\u00e2t\u00e9, or a square of cake, it seemed to me would come very\r\n\u00e0propos; and as my relish for those dainties increased, it began to\r\nappear somewhat hard that I should pass my holiday, fasting and in prison.\r\nRemote as was the attic from the street-door and vestibule, yet the\r\never-tinkling bell was faintly audible here; and also the ceaseless roll of\r\nwheels, on the tormented pavement. I knew that the house and garden were\r\nthronged, and that all was gay and glad below; here it began to grow dusk: the\r\nbeetles were fading from my sight; I trembled lest they should steal on me a\r\nmarch, mount my throne unseen, and, unsuspected, invade my skirts. Impatient\r\nand apprehensive, I recommenced the rehearsal of my part merely to kill time.\r\nJust as I was concluding, the long-delayed rattle of the key in the lock came\r\nto my ear\u2014no unwelcome sound. M. Paul (I could just see through the dusk that\r\nit was M. Paul, for light enough still lingered to show the velvet\r\nblackness of his close-shorn head, and the sallow ivory of his brow) looked in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBrava!\u201d cried he, holding the door open and remaining at the threshold. \u201cJ\u2019ai\r\ntout entendu. C\u2019est assez bien. Encore!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA moment I hesitated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEncore!\u201d said he sternly. \u201cEt point de grimaces! A bas la timidit\u00e9!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I went through the part, but not half so well as I had spoken it alone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEnfin, elle sait,\u201d said he, half dissatisfied, \u201cand one cannot be fastidious\r\nor exacting under the circumstances.\u201d Then he added, \u201cYou may yet have twenty\r\nminutes for preparation: au revoir!\u201d And he was going.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d I called out, taking courage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien! Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est, Mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019ai bien faim.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComment, vous avez faim! Et la collation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing about it. I have not seen it, shut up here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! C\u2019est vrai,\u201d cried he.\r\n\n\r\nIn a moment my throne was abdicated, the attic evacuated; an inverse repetition\r\nof the impetus which had brought me up into the attic, instantly took me\r\ndown\u2014down\u2014down to the very kitchen. I thought I should have gone to the cellar.\r\nThe cook was imperatively ordered to produce food, and I, as imperatively, was\r\ncommanded to eat. To my great joy this food was limited to coffee and cake: I\r\nhad feared wine and sweets, which I did not like. How he guessed that I should\r\nlike a petit p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00eame I cannot tell; but he went out and procured\r\nme one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and drank,\r\nkeeping the petit p\u00e2t\u00e9 till the last, as a bonne bouche. M. Paul\r\nsuperintended my repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could swallow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA la bonne heure,\u201d he cried, when I signified that I really could take no\r\nmore, and, with uplifted hands, implored to be spared the additional roll on\r\nwhich he had just spread butter. \u201cYou will set me down as a species of tyrant\r\nand Bluebeard, starving women in a garret; whereas, after all, I am no such\r\nthing. Now, Mademoiselle, do you feel courage and strength to appear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, I thought I did; though, in truth, I was perfectly confused, and could\r\nhardly tell how I felt: but this little man was of the order of beings who must\r\nnot be opposed, unless you possessed an all-dominant force sufficient to crush\r\nhim at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome then,\u201d said he, offering his hand.\r\n\n\r\nI gave him mine, and he set off with a rapid walk, which obliged me to run at\r\nhis side in order to keep pace. In the carr\u00e9 he stopped a moment: it was lit\r\nwith large lamps; the wide doors of the classes were open, and so were the\r\nequally wide garden-doors; orange-trees in tubs, and tall flowers in pots,\r\nornamented these portals on each side; groups of ladies and gentlemen in\r\nevening-dress stood and walked amongst the flowers. Within, the long vista of\r\nthe school-rooms presented a thronging, undulating, murmuring, waving,\r\nstreaming multitude, all rose, and blue, and half translucent white. There were\r\nlustres burning overhead; far off there was a stage, a solemn green curtain, a\r\nrow of footlights.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cN\u2019est-ce pas que c\u2019est beau?\u201d demanded my companion.\r\n\n\r\nI should have said it was, but my heart got up into my throat. M. Paul\r\ndiscovered this, and gave me a side-scowl and a little shake for my pains.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will do my best, but I wish it was over,\u201d said I; then I asked: \u201cAre we to\r\nwalk through that crowd?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means: I manage matters better: we pass through the garden\u2014here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn an instant we were out of doors: the cool, calm night revived me somewhat.\r\nIt was moonless, but the reflex from the many glowing windows lit the court\r\nbrightly, and even the alleys\u2014dimly. Heaven was cloudless, and grand with the\r\nquiver of its living fires. How soft are the nights of the Continent! How\r\nbland, balmy, safe! No sea-fog; no chilling damp: mistless as noon, and fresh\r\nas morning.\r\n\n\r\nHaving crossed court and garden, we reached the glass door of the first classe.\r\nIt stood open, like all other doors that night; we passed, and then I was\r\nushered into a small cabinet, dividing the first classe from the grand salle.\r\nThis cabinet dazzled me, it was so full of light: it deafened me, it was\r\nclamorous with voices: it stifled me, it was so hot, choking, thronged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDe l\u2019ordre! Du silence!\u201d cried M. Paul. \u201cIs this chaos?\u201d, he demanded; and\r\nthere was a hush. With a dozen words, and as many gestures, he turned out half\r\nthe persons present, and obliged the remnant to fall into rank. Those left were\r\nall in costume: they were the performers, and this was the green-room. M. Paul\r\nintroduced me. All stared and some tittered. It was a surprise: they had not\r\nexpected the Englishwoman would play in a vaudeville. Ginevra Fanshawe,\r\nbeautifully dressed for her part, and looking fascinatingly pretty, turned on\r\nme a pair of eyes as round as beads. In the highest spirit, unperturbed by fear\r\nor bashfulness, delighted indeed at the thought of shining off before\r\nhundreds\u2014my entrance seemed to transfix her with amazement in the midst of her\r\njoy. She would have exclaimed, but M. Paul held her and all the rest in check.\r\n\n\r\nHaving surveyed and criticized the whole troop, he turned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, too, must be dressed for your part.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDressed\u2014dressed like a man!\u201d exclaimed Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, darting forwards;\r\nadding with officiousness, \u201cI will dress her myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo be dressed like a man did not please, and would not suit me. I had consented\r\nto take a man\u2019s name and part; as to his dress\u2014halte l\u00e0! No. I would\r\nkeep my own dress, come what might. M. Paul might storm, might rage: I would\r\nkeep my own dress. I said so, with a voice as resolute in intent, as it was\r\nlow, and perhaps unsteady in utterance.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not immediately storm or rage, as I fully thought he would he stood\r\nsilent. But Z\u00e9lie again interposed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will make a capital petit-m\u00e2itre. Here are the garments, all\u2014all\r\ncomplete: somewhat too large, but\u2014I will arrange all that. Come, ch\u00e8re\r\namie\u2014belle Anglaise!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she sneered, for I was not \u201cbelle.\u201d She seized my hand, she was drawing me\r\naway. M. Paul stood impassable\u2014neutral.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must not resist,\u201d pursued St. Pierre\u2014for resist I did. \u201cYou will spoil\r\nall, destroy the mirth of the piece, the enjoyment of the company, sacrifice\r\neverything to your amour-propre. This would be too bad\u2014monsieur will\r\nnever permit this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe sought his eye. I watched, likewise, for a glance. He gave her one, and\r\nthen he gave me one. \u201cStop!\u201d he said slowly, arresting St. Pierre, who\r\ncontinued her efforts to drag me after her. Everybody awaited the decision. He\r\nwas not angry, not irritated; I perceived that, and took heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not like these clothes?\u201d he asked, pointing to the masculine vestments.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t object to some of them, but I won\u2019t have them all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow must it be, then? How accept a man\u2019s part, and go on the stage dressed as\r\na woman? This is an amateur affair, it is true\u2014a vaudeville de\r\npensionnat; certain modifications I might sanction, yet something you must\r\nhave to announce you as of the nobler sex.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I will, Monsieur; but it must be arranged in my own way: nobody must\r\nmeddle; the things must not be forced upon me. Just let me dress myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMonsieur, without another word, took the costume from St. Pierre, gave it to\r\nme, and permitted me to pass into the dressing-room. Once alone, I grew calm,\r\nand collectedly went to work. Retaining my woman\u2019s garb without the slightest\r\nretrenchment, I merely assumed, in addition, a little vest, a collar, and\r\ncravat, and a palet\u00f4t of small dimensions; the whole being the costume of a\r\nbrother of one of the pupils. Having loosened my hair out of its braids, made\r\nup the long back-hair close, and brushed the front hair to one side, I took my\r\nhat and gloves in my hand and came out. M. Paul was waiting, and so were the\r\nothers. He looked at me. \u201cThat may pass in a pensionnat,\u201d he pronounced. Then\r\nadded, not unkindly, \u201cCourage, mon ami! Un peu de sangfroid\u2014un peu d\u2019aplomb, M.\r\nLucien, et tout ira bien.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSt. Pierre sneered again, in her cold snaky manner.\r\n\n\r\nI was irritable, because excited, and I could not help turning upon her and\r\nsaying, that if she were not a lady and I a gentleman, I should feel disposed\r\nto call her out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfter the play, after the play,\u201d said M. Paul. \u201cI will then divide my pair of\r\npistols between you, and we will settle the dispute according to form: it will\r\nonly be the old quarrel of France and England.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut now the moment approached for the performance to commence. M. Paul, setting\r\nus before him, harangued us briefly, like a general addressing soldiers about\r\nto charge. I don\u2019t know what he said, except that he recommended each to\r\npenetrate herself with a sense of her personal insignificance. God knows I\r\nthought this advice superfluous for some of us. A bell tinkled. I and two more\r\nwere ushered on to the stage. The bell tinkled again. I had to speak the very\r\nfirst words.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not look at the crowd, nor think of it,\u201d whispered M. Paul in my ear.\r\n\u201cImagine yourself in the garret, acting to the rats.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe vanished. The curtain drew up\u2014shrivelled to the ceiling: the bright lights,\r\nthe long room, the gay throng, burst upon us. I thought of the black-beetles,\r\nthe old boxes, the worm-eaten bureau. I said my say badly; but I said it. That\r\nfirst speech was the difficulty; it revealed to me this fact, that it was not\r\nthe crowd I feared so much as my own voice. Foreigners and strangers, the crowd\r\nwere nothing to me. Nor did I think of them. When my tongue once got free, and\r\nmy voice took its true pitch, and found its natural tone, I thought of nothing\r\nbut the personage I represented\u2014and of M. Paul, who was listening, watching,\r\nprompting in the side-scenes.\r\n\n\r\nBy-and-by, feeling the right power come\u2014the spring demanded gush and rise\r\ninwardly\u2014I became sufficiently composed to notice my fellow-actors. Some of\r\nthem played very well; especially Ginevra Fanshawe, who had to coquette between\r\ntwo suitors, and managed admirably: in fact she was in her element. I observed\r\nthat she once or twice threw a certain marked fondness and pointed partiality\r\ninto her manner towards me\u2014the fop. With such emphasis and animation did she\r\nfavour me, such glances did she dart out into the listening and applauding\r\ncrowd, that to me\u2014who knew her\u2014it presently became evident she was acting\r\nat some one; and I followed her eye, her smile, her gesture, and ere\r\nlong discovered that she had at least singled out a handsome and distinguished\r\naim for her shafts; full in the path of those arrows\u2014taller than other\r\nspectators, and therefore more sure to receive them\u2014stood, in attitude quiet\r\nbut intent, a well-known form\u2014that of Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\nThe spectacle seemed somehow suggestive. There was language in Dr. John\u2019s look,\r\nthough I cannot tell what he said; it animated me: I drew out of it a history;\r\nI put my idea into the part I performed; I threw it into my wooing of Ginevra.\r\nIn the \u201cOurs,\u201d or sincere lover, I saw Dr. John. Did I pity him, as erst? No, I\r\nhardened my heart, rivalled and out-rivalled him. I knew myself but a fop, but\r\nwhere he was outcast I could please. Now I know I acted as if\r\nwishful and resolute to win and conquer. Ginevra seconded me; between us we\r\nhalf-changed the nature of the r\u00f4le, gilding it from top to toe. Between\r\nthe acts M. Paul, told us he knew not what possessed us, and half expostulated.\r\n\u201cC\u2019est peut-\u00eatre plus beau que votre mod\u00e8le,\u201d said he, \u201cmais ce n\u2019est pas\r\njuste.\u201d I know not what possessed me either; but somehow, my longing was to\r\neclipse the \u201cOurs,\u201d i.e., Dr. John. Ginevra was tender; how could I be\r\notherwise than chivalric? Retaining the letter, I recklessly altered the spirit\r\nof the r\u00f4le. Without heart, without interest, I could not play it at\r\nall. It must be played\u2014in went the yearned-for seasoning\u2014thus favoured, I\r\nplayed it with relish.\r\n\n\r\nWhat I felt that night, and what I did, I no more expected to feel and do, than\r\nto be lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven. Cold, reluctant, apprehensive,\r\nI had accepted a part to please another: ere long, warming, becoming\r\ninterested, taking courage, I acted to please myself. Yet the next day, when I\r\nthought it over, I quite disapproved of these amateur performances; and though\r\nglad that I had obliged M. Paul, and tried my own strength for once, I took a\r\nfirm resolution, never to be drawn into a similar affair. A keen relish for\r\ndramatic expression had revealed itself as part of my nature; to cherish and\r\nexercise this new-found faculty might gift me with a world of delight, but it\r\nwould not do for a mere looker-on at life: the strength and longing must be put\r\nby; and I put them by, and fastened them in with the lock of a resolution which\r\nneither Time nor Temptation has since picked.\r\n\n\r\nNo sooner was the play over, and well over, than the choleric and\r\narbitrary M. Paul underwent a metamorphosis. His hour of managerial\r\nresponsibility past, he at once laid aside his magisterial austerity; in a\r\nmoment he stood amongst us, vivacious, kind, and social, shook hands with us\r\nall round, thanked us separately, and announced his determination that each of\r\nus should in turn be his partner in the coming ball. On his claiming my\r\npromise, I told him I did not dance. \u201cFor once I must,\u201d was the answer; and if\r\nI had not slipped aside and kept out of his way, he would have compelled me to\r\nthis second performance. But I had acted enough for one evening; it was time I\r\nretired into myself and my ordinary life. My dun-coloured dress did well enough\r\nunder a palet\u00f4t on the stage, but would not suit a waltz or a quadrille.\r\nWithdrawing to a quiet nook, whence unobserved I could observe\u2014the ball, its\r\nsplendours and its pleasures, passed before me as a spectacle.\r\n\n\r\nAgain Ginevra Fanshawe was the belle, the fairest and the gayest present; she\r\nwas selected to open the ball: very lovely she looked, very gracefully she\r\ndanced, very joyously she smiled. Such scenes were her triumphs\u2014she was the\r\nchild of pleasure. Work or suffering found her listless and dejected, powerless\r\nand repining; but gaiety expanded her butterfly\u2019s wings, lit up their gold-dust\r\nand bright spots, made her flash like a gem, and flush like a flower. At all\r\nordinary diet and plain beverage she would pout; but she fed on creams and ices\r\nlike a humming-bird on honey-paste: sweet wine was her element, and sweet cake\r\nher daily bread. Ginevra lived her full life in a ball-room; elsewhere she\r\ndrooped dispirited.\r\n\n\r\nThink not, reader, that she thus bloomed and sparkled for the mere sake of M.\r\nPaul, her partner, or that she lavished her best graces that night for the\r\nedification of her companions only, or for that of the parents and\r\ngrand-parents, who filled the carr\u00e9, and lined the ball-room; under\r\ncircumstances so insipid and limited, with motives so chilly and vapid, Ginevra\r\nwould scarce have deigned to walk one quadrille, and weariness and fretfulness\r\nwould have replaced animation and good-humour, but she knew of a leaven in the\r\notherwise heavy festal mass which lighted the whole; she tasted a condiment\r\nwhich gave it zest; she perceived reasons justifying the display of her\r\nchoicest attractions.\r\n\n\r\nIn the ball-room, indeed, not a single male spectator was to be seen who was\r\nnot married and a father\u2014M. Paul excepted\u2014that gentleman, too, being the sole\r\ncreature of his sex permitted to lead out a pupil to the dance; and this\r\nexceptional part was allowed him, partly as a matter of old-established custom\r\n(for he was a kinsman of Madame Beck\u2019s, and high in her confidence), partly\r\nbecause he would always have his own way and do as he pleased, and partly\r\nbecause\u2014wilful, passionate, partial, as he might be\u2014he was the soul of honour,\r\nand might be trusted with a regiment of the fairest and purest; in perfect\r\nsecurity that under his leadership they would come to no harm. Many of the\r\ngirls\u2014it may be noted in parenthesis\u2014were not pure-minded at all, very much\r\notherwise; but they no more dare betray their natural coarseness in M. Paul\u2019s\r\npresence, than they dare tread purposely on his corns, laugh in his face during\r\na stormy apostrophe, or speak above their breath while some crisis of\r\nirritability was covering his human visage with the mask of an intelligent\r\ntiger. M. Paul, then, might dance with whom he would\u2014and woe be to the\r\ninterference which put him out of step.\r\n\n\r\nOthers there were admitted as spectators\u2014with (seeming) reluctance, through\r\nprayers, by influence, under restriction, by special and difficult exercise of\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s gracious good-nature, and whom she all the evening\u2014with her own\r\npersonal surveillance\u2014kept far aloof at the remotest, drearest, coldest,\r\ndarkest side of the carr\u00e9\u2014a small, forlorn band of \u201cjeunes gens;\u201d these being\r\nall of the best families, grown-up sons of mothers present, and whose sisters\r\nwere pupils in the school. That whole evening was Madame on duty beside these\r\n\u201cjeunes gens\u201d\u2014attentive to them as a mother, but strict with them as a dragon.\r\nThere was a sort of cordon stretched before them, which they wearied her with\r\nprayers to be permitted to pass, and just to revive themselves by one dance\r\nwith that \u201cbelle blonde,\u201d or that \u201cjolie brune,\u201d or \u201ccette jeune fille\r\nmagnifique aux cheveux noirs comme le jais.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTaisez-vous!\u201d Madame would reply, heroically and inexorably. \u201cVous ne passerez\r\npas \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit sur mon cadavre, et vous ne danserez qu\u2019avec la\r\nnonnette du jardin\u201d (alluding to the legend). And she majestically walked to\r\nand fro along their disconsolate and impatient line, like a little Bonaparte in\r\na mouse-coloured silk gown.\r\n\n\r\nMadame knew something of the world; Madame knew much of human nature. I don\u2019t\r\nthink that another directress in Villette would have dared to admit a \u201cjeune\r\nhomme\u201d within her walls; but Madame knew that by granting such admission, on an\r\noccasion like the present, a bold stroke might be struck, and a great point\r\ngained.\r\n\n\r\nIn the first place, the parents were made accomplices to the deed, for it was\r\nonly through their mediation it was brought about. Secondly: the admission of\r\nthese rattlesnakes, so fascinating and so dangerous, served to draw out Madame\r\nprecisely in her strongest character\u2014that of a first-rate surveillante.\r\nThirdly: their presence furnished a most piquant ingredient to the\r\nentertainment: the pupils knew it, and saw it, and the view of such golden\r\napples shining afar off, animated them with a spirit no other circumstance\r\ncould have kindled. The children\u2019s pleasure spread to the parents; life and\r\nmirth circulated quickly round the ball-room; the \u201cjeunes gens\u201d themselves,\r\nthough restrained, were amused: for Madame never permitted them to feel\r\ndull\u2014and thus Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate annually ensured a success unknown to the f\u00eate\r\nof any other directress in the land.\r\n\n\r\nI observed that Dr. John was at first permitted to walk at large through the\r\nclasses: there was about him a manly, responsible look, that redeemed his\r\nyouth, and half-expiated his beauty; but as soon as the ball began, Madame ran\r\nup to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Wolf; come,\u201d said she, laughing: \u201cyou wear sheep\u2019s clothing, but you\r\nmust quit the fold notwithstanding. Come; I have a fine menagerie of twenty\r\nhere in the carr\u00e9: let me place you amongst my collection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut first suffer me to have one dance with one pupil of my choice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you the face to ask such a thing? It is madness: it is impiety. Sortez,\r\nsortez, au plus vite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe drove him before her, and soon had him enclosed within the cordon.\r\n\n\r\nGinevra being, I suppose, tired with dancing, sought me out in my retreat. She\r\nthrew herself on the bench beside me, and (a demonstration I could very well\r\nhave dispensed with) cast her arms round my neck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe! Lucy Snowe!\u201d she cried in a somewhat sobbing voice, half\r\nhysterical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the world is the matter?\u201d I drily said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do I look\u2014how do I look to-night?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs usual,\u201d said I; \u201cpreposterously vain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaustic creature! You never have a kind word for me; but in spite of you, and\r\nall other envious detractors, I know I am beautiful; I feel it, I see it\u2014for\r\nthere is a great looking-glass in the dressing-room, where I can view my shape\r\nfrom head to foot. Will you go with me now, and let us two stand before it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Fanshawe: you shall be humoured even to the top of your bent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe dressing-room was very near, and we stepped in. Putting her arm through\r\nmine, she drew me to the mirror. Without resistance remonstrance, or remark, I\r\nstood and let her self-love have its feast and triumph: curious to see how much\r\nit could swallow\u2014whether it was possible it could feed to satiety\u2014whether any\r\nwhisper of consideration for others could penetrate her heart, and moderate its\r\nvainglorious exultation.\r\n\n\r\nNot at all. She turned me and herself round; she viewed us both on all sides;\r\nshe smiled, she waved her curls, she retouched her sash, she spread her dress,\r\nand finally, letting go my arm, and curtseying with mock respect, she said: \u201cI\r\nwould not be you for a kingdom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe remark was too na\u00efve to rouse anger; I merely said: \u201cVery good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what would you give to be ME?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a bad sixpence\u2014strange as it may sound,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou are but a poor\r\ncreature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think so in your heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; for in my heart you have not the outline of a place: I only occasionally\r\nturn you over in my brain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, but,\u201d said she, in an expostulatory tone, \u201cjust listen to the difference\r\nof our positions, and then see how happy am I, and how miserable are you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo on; I listen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place: I am the daughter of a gentleman of family, and though my\r\nfather is not rich, I have expectations from an uncle. Then, I am just\r\neighteen, the finest age possible. I have had a continental education, and\r\nthough I can\u2019t spell, I have abundant accomplishments. I am pretty;\r\nyou can\u2019t deny that; I may have as many admirers as I choose. This very\r\nnight I have been breaking the hearts of two gentlemen, and it is the dying\r\nlook I had from one of them just now, which puts me in such spirits. I do so\r\nlike to watch them turn red and pale, and scowl and dart fiery glances at each\r\nother, and languishing ones at me. There is me\u2014happy ME; now for\r\nyou, poor soul!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you are nobody\u2019s daughter, since you took care of little children\r\nwhen you first came to Villette: you have no relations; you can\u2019t call yourself\r\nyoung at twenty-three; you have no attractive accomplishments\u2014no beauty. As to\r\nadmirers, you hardly know what they are; you can\u2019t even talk on the subject:\r\nyou sit dumb when the other teachers quote their conquests. I believe you never\r\nwere in love, and never will be: you don\u2019t know the feeling, and so much the\r\nbetter, for though you might have your own heart broken, no living heart will\r\nyou ever break. Isn\u2019t it all true?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good deal of it is true as gospel, and shrewd besides. There must be good in\r\nyou, Ginevra, to speak so honestly; that snake, Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, could not\r\nutter what you have uttered. Still, Miss Fanshawe, hapless as I am, according\r\nto your showing, sixpence I would not give to purchase you, body and soul.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust because I am not clever, and that is all you think of. Nobody in\r\nthe world but you cares for cleverness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I consider you are clever, in your way\u2014very smart\r\nindeed. But you were talking of breaking hearts\u2014that edifying amusement into\r\nthe merits of which I don\u2019t quite enter; pray on whom does your vanity lead you\r\nto think you have done execution to-night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe approached her lips to my ear\u2014\u201cIsidore and Alfred de Hamal are both here,\u201d\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! they are? I should like to see them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dear creature! your curiosity is roused at last. Follow me, I will\r\npoint them out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe proudly led the way\u2014\u201cBut you cannot see them well from the classes,\u201d said\r\nshe, turning, \u201cMadame keeps them too far off. Let us cross the garden, enter by\r\nthe corridor, and get close to them behind: we shall be scolded if we are seen,\r\nbut never mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor once, I did not mind. Through the garden we went\u2014penetrated into the\r\ncorridor by a quiet private entrance, and approaching the carr\u00e9, yet\r\nkeeping in the corridor shade, commanded a near view of the band of \u201cjeunes\r\ngens.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI believe I could have picked out the conquering de Hamal even undirected. He\r\nwas a straight-nosed, very correct-featured little dandy. I say little\r\ndandy, though he was not beneath the middle standard in stature; but his\r\nlineaments were small, and so were his hands and feet; and he was pretty and\r\nsmooth, and as trim as a doll: so nicely dressed, so nicely curled, so booted\r\nand gloved and cravated\u2014he was charming indeed. I said so. \u201cWhat, a dear\r\npersonage!\u201d cried I, and commended Ginevra\u2019s taste warmly; and asked her what\r\nshe thought de Hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart\r\nshe had broken\u2014whether he kept them in a scent-vial, and conserved them in otto\r\nof roses? I observed, too, with deep rapture of approbation, that the colonel\u2019s\r\nhands were scarce larger than Miss Fanshawe\u2019s own, and suggested that this\r\ncircumstance might be convenient, as he could wear her gloves at a pinch. On\r\nhis dear curls, I told her I doated: and as to his low, Grecian brow, and\r\nexquisite classic headpiece, I confessed I had no language to do such\r\nperfections justice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if he were your lover?\u201d suggested the cruelly exultant Ginevra.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! heavens, what bliss!\u201d said I; \u201cbut do not be inhuman, Miss Fanshawe: to\r\nput such thoughts into my head is like showing poor outcast Cain a far, glimpse\r\nof Paradise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou like him, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs I like sweets, and jams, and comfits, and conservatory flowers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGinevra admired my taste, for all these things were her adoration; she could\r\nthen readily credit that they were mine too.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow for Isidore,\u201d I went on. I own I felt still more curious to see him than\r\nhis rival; but Ginevra was absorbed in the latter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlfred was admitted here to-night,\u201d said she, \u201cthrough the influence of his\r\naunt, Madame la Baronne de Dorlodot; and now, having seen him, can you not\r\nunderstand why I have been in such spirits all the evening, and acted so well,\r\nand danced with such life, and why I am now happy as a queen? Dieu! Dieu! It\r\nwas such good fun to glance first at him and then at the other, and madden them\r\nboth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut that other\u2014where is he? Show me Isidore.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause\u2014because\u201d (in a whisper) \u201che has such\u2014such whiskers, orange\u2014red\u2014there\r\nnow!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe murder is out,\u201d I subjoined. \u201cNever mind, show him all the same; I engage\r\nnot to faint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked round. Just then an English voice spoke behind her and me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are both standing in a draught; you must leave this corridor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no draught, Dr. John,\u201d said I, turning.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe takes cold so easily,\u201d he pursued, looking at Ginevra with extreme\r\nkindness. \u201cShe is delicate; she must be cared for: fetch her a shawl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to judge for myself,\u201d said Miss Fanshawe, with hauteur. \u201cI want no\r\nshawl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour dress is thin, you have been dancing, you are heated.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlways preaching,\u201d retorted she; \u201calways coddling and admonishing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe answer Dr. John would have given did not come; that his heart was hurt\r\nbecame evident in his eye; darkened, and saddened, and pained, he turned a\r\nlittle aside, but was patient. I knew where there were plenty of shawls near at\r\nhand; I ran and fetched one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe shall wear this, if I have strength to make her,\u201d said I, folding it well\r\nround her muslin dress, covering carefully her neck and her arms. \u201cIs that\r\nIsidore?\u201d I asked, in a somewhat fierce whisper.\r\n\n\r\nShe pushed up her lip, smiled, and nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that Isidore?\u201d I repeated, giving her a shake: I could have given\r\nher a dozen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est lui-m\u00eame,\u201d said she. \u201cHow coarse he is, compared with the Colonel-Count!\r\nAnd then\u2014oh ciel!\u2014the whiskers!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDr. John now passed on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Colonel-Count!\u201d I echoed. \u201cThe doll\u2014the puppet\u2014the manikin\u2014the poor\r\ninferior creature! A mere lackey for Dr. John his valet, his foot-boy! Is it\r\npossible that fine generous gentleman\u2014handsome as a vision\u2014offers you his\r\nhonourable hand and gallant heart, and promises to protect your flimsy person\r\nand feckless mind through the storms and struggles of life\u2014and you hang\r\nback\u2014you scorn, you sting, you torture him! Have you power to do this? Who gave\r\nyou that power? Where is it? Does it lie all in your beauty\u2014your pink and white\r\ncomplexion, and your yellow hair? Does this bind his soul at your feet, and\r\nbend his neck under your yoke? Does this purchase for you his affection, his\r\ntenderness, his thoughts, his hopes, his interest, his noble, cordial love\u2014and\r\nwill you not have it? Do you scorn it? You are only dissembling: you are not in\r\nearnest: you love him; you long for him; but you trifle with his heart to make\r\nhim more surely yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! How you run on! I don\u2019t understand half you have said.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had got her out into the garden ere this. I now set her down on a seat and\r\ntold her she should not stir till she had avowed which she meant in the end to\r\naccept\u2014the man or the monkey.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHim you call the man,\u201d said she, \u201cis bourgeois, sandy-haired, and answers to\r\nthe name of John!\u2014cela suffit: je n\u2019en veux pas. Colonel de Hamal is a\r\ngentleman of excellent connections, perfect manners, sweet appearance, with\r\npale interesting face, and hair and eyes like an Italian. Then too he is the\r\nmost delightful company possible\u2014a man quite in my way; not sensible and\r\nserious like the other; but one with whom I can talk on equal terms\u2014who does\r\nnot plague and bore, and harass me with depths, and heights, and passions, and\r\ntalents for which I have no taste. There now. Don\u2019t hold me so fast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI slackened my grasp, and she darted off. I did not care to pursue her.\r\n\n\r\nSomehow I could not avoid returning once more in the direction of the corridor\r\nto get another glimpse of Dr. John; but I met him on the garden-steps, standing\r\nwhere the light from a window fell broad. His well-proportioned figure was not\r\nto be mistaken, for I doubt whether there was another in that assemblage his\r\nequal. He carried his hat in his hand; his uncovered head, his face and fine\r\nbrow were most handsome and manly. His features were not delicate, not\r\nslight like those of a woman, nor were they cold, frivolous, and feeble; though\r\nwell cut, they were not so chiselled, so frittered away, as to lose in\r\nexpression or significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry. Much feeling\r\nspoke in them at times, and more sat silent in his eye. Such at least were my\r\nthoughts of him: to me he seemed all this. An inexpressible sense of wonder\r\noccupied me, as I looked at this man, and reflected that he could not be\r\nslighted.\r\n\n\r\nIt was, not my intention to approach or address him in the garden, our terms of\r\nacquaintance not warranting such a step; I had only meant to view him in the\r\ncrowd\u2014myself unseen: coming upon him thus alone, I withdrew. But he was looking\r\nout for me, or rather for her who had been with me: therefore he descended the\r\nsteps, and followed me down the alley.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know Miss Fanshawe? I have often wished to ask whether you knew her,\u201d said\r\nhe.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: I know her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIntimately?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite as intimately as I wish.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done with her now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I her keeper?\u201d I felt inclined to ask; but I simply answered, \u201cI have\r\nshaken her well, and would have shaken her better, but she escaped out of my\r\nhands and ran away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you favour me,\u201d he asked, \u201cby watching over her this one evening, and\r\nobserving that she does nothing imprudent\u2014does not, for instance, run out into\r\nthe night-air immediately after dancing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI may, perhaps, look after her a little; since you wish it; but she likes her\r\nown way too well to submit readily to control.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is so young, so thoroughly artless,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo me she is an enigma,\u201d I responded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she?\u201d he asked\u2014much interested. \u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would be difficult to say how\u2014difficult, at least, to tell you how.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder she is not better pleased that you are so much her friend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut she has not the slightest idea how much I am her friend. That is\r\nprecisely the point I cannot teach her. May I inquire did she ever speak of me\r\nto you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnder the name of \u2018Isidore\u2019 she has talked about you often; but I must add\r\nthat it is only within the last ten minutes I have discovered that you and\r\n\u2018Isidore\u2019 are identical. It is only, Dr. John, within that brief space of time\r\nI have learned that Ginevra Fanshawe is the person, under this roof, in whom\r\nyou have long been interested\u2014that she is the magnet which attracts you to the\r\nRue Fossette, that for her sake you venture into this garden, and seek out\r\ncaskets dropped by rivals.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know all?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know so much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor more than a year I have been accustomed to meet her in society. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley, her friend, is an acquaintance of mine; thus I see her every\r\nSunday. But you observed that under the name of \u2018Isidore\u2019 she often spoke of\r\nme: may I\u2014without inviting you to a breach of confidence\u2014inquire what was the\r\ntone, what the feeling of her remarks? I feel somewhat anxious to know, being a\r\nlittle tormented with uncertainty as to how I stand with her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, she varies: she shifts and changes like the wind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill, you can gather some general idea\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can,\u201d thought I, \u201cbut it would not do to communicate that general idea to\r\nyou. Besides, if I said she did not love you, I know you would not believe me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are silent,\u201d he pursued. \u201cI suppose you have no good news to impart. No\r\nmatter. If she feels for me positive coldness and aversion, it is a sign I do\r\nnot deserve her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you doubt yourself? Do you consider yourself the inferior of Colonel de\r\nHamal?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI love Miss Fanshawe far more than de Hamal loves any human being, and would\r\ncare for and guard her better than he. Respecting de Hamal, I fear she is under\r\nan illusion; the man\u2019s character is known to me, all his antecedents, all his\r\nscrapes. He is not worthy of your beautiful young friend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy \u2018beautiful young friend\u2019 ought to know that, and to know or feel who is\r\nworthy of her,\u201d said I. \u201cIf her beauty or her brains will not serve her so far,\r\nshe merits the sharp lesson of experience.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you not a little severe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am excessively severe\u2014more severe than I choose to show you. You should hear\r\nthe strictures with which I favour my \u2018beautiful young friend,\u2019 only that you\r\nwould be unutterably shocked at my want of tender considerateness for her\r\ndelicate nature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is so lovely, one cannot but be loving towards her. You\u2014every woman older\r\nthan herself, must feel for such a simple, innocent, girlish fairy a sort of\r\nmotherly or elder-sisterly fondness. Graceful angel! Does not your heart yearn\r\ntowards her when she pours into your ear her pure, childlike confidences? How\r\nyou are privileged!\u201d And he sighed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cut short these confidences somewhat abruptly now and then,\u201d said I. \u201cBut\r\nexcuse me, Dr. John, may I change the theme for one instant? What a god-like\r\nperson is that de Hamal! What a nose on his face\u2014perfect! Model one in putty or\r\nclay, you could not make a better or straighter, or neater; and then, such\r\nclassic lips and chin\u2014and his bearing\u2014sublime.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDe Hamal is an unutterable puppy, besides being a very white-livered hero.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, Dr. John, and every man of a less-refined mould than he, must feel for\r\nhim a sort of admiring affection, such as Mars and the coarser deities may be\r\nsupposed to have borne the young, graceful Apollo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn unprincipled, gambling little jackanapes!\u201d said Dr. John curtly, \u201cwhom,\r\nwith one hand, I could lift up by the waistband any day, and lay low in the\r\nkennel if I liked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sweet seraph!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat a cruel idea! Are you not a little severe,\r\nDr. John?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd now I paused. For the second time that night I was going beyond\r\nmyself\u2014venturing out of what I looked on as my natural habits\u2014speaking in an\r\nunpremeditated, impulsive strain, which startled me strangely when I halted to\r\nreflect. On rising that morning, had I anticipated that before night I should\r\nhave acted the part of a gay lover in a vaudeville; and an hour after, frankly\r\ndiscussed with Dr. John the question of his hapless suit, and rallied him on\r\nhis illusions? I had no more presaged such feats than I had looked forward to\r\nan ascent in a balloon, or a voyage to Cape Horn.\r\n\n\r\nThe Doctor and I, having paced down the walk, were now returning; the reflex\r\nfrom the window again lit his face: he smiled, but his eye was melancholy. How\r\nI wished that he could feel heart\u2019s-ease! How I grieved that he brooded over\r\npain, and pain from such a cause! He, with his great advantages, he to\r\nlove in vain! I did not then know that the pensiveness of reverse is the best\r\nphase for some minds; nor did I reflect that some herbs, \u201cthough scentless when\r\nentire, yield fragrance when they\u2019re bruised.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not be sorrowful, do not grieve,\u201d I broke out. \u201cIf there is in Ginevra one\r\nspark of worthiness of your affection, she will\u2014she must feel devotion\r\nin return. Be cheerful, be hopeful, Dr. John. Who should hope, if not you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn return for this speech I got\u2014what, it must be supposed, I deserved\u2014a look of\r\nsurprise: I thought also of some disapprobation. We parted, and I went into the\r\nhouse very chill. The clocks struck and the bells tolled midnight; people were\r\nleaving fast: the f\u00eate was over; the lamps were fading. In another hour all the\r\ndwelling-house, and all the pensionnat, were dark and hushed. I too was in bed,\r\nbut not asleep. To me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement.\r\n\n"}
{"16": "\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTHE LONG VACATION.\n\r\nFollowing Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate, with its three preceding weeks of relaxation, its\r\nbrief twelve hours\u2019 burst of hilarity and dissipation, and its one subsequent\r\nday of utter languor, came a period of reaction; two months of real\r\napplication, of close, hard study. These two months, being the last of the\r\n\u201cann\u00e9e scolaire,\u201d were indeed the only genuine working months in the year. To\r\nthem was procrastinated\u2014into them concentrated, alike by professors,\r\nmistresses, and pupils\u2014the main burden of preparation for the examinations\r\npreceding the distribution of prizes. Candidates for rewards had then to work\r\nin good earnest; masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to the wheel,\r\nto urge on the backward, and diligently aid and train the more promising. A\r\nshowy demonstration\u2014a telling exhibition\u2014must be got up for public view, and\r\nall means were fair to this end.\r\n\n\r\nI scarcely noted how the other teachers went to work; I had my own business to\r\nmind; and my task was not the least onerous, being to imbue some ninety\r\nsets of brains with a due tincture of what they considered a most complicated\r\nand difficult science, that of the English language; and to drill ninety\r\ntongues in what, for them, was an almost impossible pronunciation\u2014the lisping\r\nand hissing dentals of the Isles.\r\n\n\r\nThe examination-day arrived. Awful day! Prepared for with anxious care, dressed\r\nfor with silent despatch\u2014nothing vaporous or fluttering now\u2014no white gauze or\r\nazure streamers; the grave, close, compact was the order of the toilette. It\r\nseemed to me that I was this day, especially doomed\u2014the main burden and trial\r\nfalling on me alone of all the female teachers. The others were not expected to\r\nexamine in the studies they taught; the professor of literature, M. Paul,\r\ntaking upon himself this duty. He, this school autocrat, gathered all and\r\nsundry reins into the hollow of his one hand; he irefully rejected any\r\ncolleague; he would not have help. Madame herself, who evidently rather wished\r\nto undertake the examination in geography\u2014her favourite study, which she taught\r\nwell\u2014was forced to succumb, and be subordinate to her despotic kinsman\u2019s\r\ndirection. The whole staff of instructors, male and female, he set aside, and\r\nstood on the examiner\u2019s estrade alone. It irked him that he was forced to make\r\none exception to this rule. He could not manage English: he was obliged to\r\nleave that branch of education in the English teacher\u2019s hands; which he did,\r\nnot without a flash of na\u00efve jealousy.\r\n\n\r\nA constant crusade against the \u201camour-propre\u201d of every human being but himself,\r\nwas the crotchet of this able, but fiery and grasping little man. He had a\r\nstrong relish for public representation in his own person, but an extreme\r\nabhorrence of the like display in any other. He quelled, he kept down when he\r\ncould; and when he could not, he fumed like a bottled storm.\r\n\n\r\nOn the evening preceding the examination-day, I was walking in the garden, as\r\nwere the other teachers and all the boarders. M. Emanuel joined me in the\r\n\u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue;\u201d his cigar was at his lips; his palet\u00f4t\u2014a most characteristic\r\ngarment of no particular shape\u2014hung dark and menacing; the tassel of his bonnet\r\ngrec sternly shadowed his left temple; his black whiskers curled like those of\r\na wrathful cat; his blue eye had a cloud in its glitter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAinsi,\u201d he began, abruptly fronting and arresting me, \u201cvous allez tr\u00f4ner comme\r\nune reine; demain\u2014tr\u00f4ner \u00e0 mes c\u00f4t\u00e9s? Sans doute vous savourez d\u2019avance les\r\nd\u00e9lices de l\u2019autorit\u00e9. Je crois voir en je ne sais quoi de rayonnante, petite\r\nambitieuse!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow the fact was, he happened to be entirely mistaken. I did not\u2014could\r\nnot\u2014estimate the admiration or the good opinion of tomorrow\u2019s audience at the\r\nsame rate he did. Had that audience numbered as many personal friends and\r\nacquaintance for me as for him, I know not how it might have been: I speak of\r\nthe case as it stood. On me school-triumphs shed but a cold lustre. I had\r\nwondered\u2014and I wondered now\u2014how it was that for him they seemed to shine as\r\nwith hearth-warmth and hearth-glow. He cared for them perhaps too much;\r\nI, probably, too little. However, I had my own fancies as well as he. I\r\nliked, for instance, to see M. Emanuel jealous; it lit up his nature, and woke\r\nhis spirit; it threw all sorts of queer lights and shadows over his dun face,\r\nand into his violet-azure eyes (he used to say that his black hair and blue\r\neyes were \u201cune de ses beaut\u00e9s\u201d). There was a relish in his anger; it was\r\nartless, earnest, quite unreasonable, but never hypocritical. I uttered no\r\ndisclaimer then of the complacency he attributed to me; I merely asked where\r\nthe English examination came in\u2014whether at the commencement or close of the\r\nday?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hesitate,\u201d said he, \u201cwhether at the very beginning, before many persons are\r\ncome, and when your aspiring nature will not be gratified by a large audience,\r\nor quite at the close, when everybody is tired, and only a jaded and worn-out\r\nattention will be at your service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue vous \u00eates dur, Monsieur!\u201d I said, affecting dejection.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne ought to be \u2018dur\u2019 with you. You are one of those beings who must be\r\nkept down. I know you! I know you! Other people in this house see you\r\npass, and think that a colourless shadow has gone by. As for me, I scrutinized\r\nyour face once, and it sufficed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are satisfied that you understand me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout answering directly, he went on, \u201cWere you not gratified when you\r\nsucceeded in that vaudeville? I watched you and saw a passionate ardour for\r\ntriumph in your physiognomy. What fire shot into the glance! Not mere light,\r\nbut flame: je me tiens pour averti.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat feeling I had on that occasion, Monsieur\u2014and pardon me, if I say, you\r\nimmensely exaggerate both its quality and quantity\u2014was quite abstract. I did\r\nnot care for the vaudeville. I hated the part you assigned me. I had not the\r\nslightest sympathy with the audience below the stage. They are good people,\r\ndoubtless, but do I know them? Are they anything to me? Can I care for being\r\nbrought before their view again to-morrow? Will the examination be anything but\r\na task to me\u2014a task I wish well over?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I take it out of your hands?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith all my heart; if you do not fear failure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I should fail. I only know three phrases of English, and a few words: par\r\nexemple, de sonn, de mone, de stare\u2014est-ce bien dit? My opinion is that it\r\nwould be better to give up the thing altogether: to have no English\r\nexamination, eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf Madame consents, I consent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeartily?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery heartily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe smoked his cigar in silence. He turned suddenly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonnez-moi la main,\u201d said he, and the spite and jealousy melted out of his\r\nface, and a generous kindliness shone there instead.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, we will not be rivals, we will be friends,\u201d he pursued. \u201cThe examination\r\nshall take place, and I will choose a good moment; and instead of vexing and\r\nhindering, as I felt half-inclined ten minutes ago\u2014for I have my malevolent\r\nmoods: I always had from childhood\u2014I will aid you sincerely. After all, you are\r\nsolitary and a stranger, and have your way to make and your bread to earn; it\r\nmay be well that you should become known. We will be friends: do you agree?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOut of my heart, Monsieur. I am glad of a friend. I like that better than a\r\ntriumph.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPauvrette!\u201d said he, and turned away and left the alley.\r\n\n\r\nThe examination passed over well; M. Paul was as good as his word, and did his\r\nbest to make my part easy. The next day came the distribution of prizes; that\r\nalso passed; the school broke up; the pupils went home, and now began the long\r\nvacation.\r\n\n\r\nThat vacation! Shall I ever forget it? I think not. Madame Beck went, the first\r\nday of the holidays, to join her children at the sea-side; all the three\r\nteachers had parents or friends with whom they took refuge; every professor\r\nquitted the city; some went to Paris, some to Boue-Marine; M. Paul set forth on\r\na pilgrimage to Rome; the house was left quite empty, but for me, a servant,\r\nand a poor deformed and imbecile pupil, a sort of cr\u00e9tin, whom her stepmother\r\nin a distant province would not allow to return home.\r\n\n\r\nMy heart almost died within me; miserable longings strained its chords. How\r\nlong were the September days! How silent, how lifeless! How vast and void\r\nseemed the desolate premises! How gloomy the forsaken garden\u2014grey now with the\r\ndust of a town summer departed. Looking forward at the commencement of those\r\neight weeks, I hardly knew how I was to live to the end. My spirits had long\r\nbeen gradually sinking; now that the prop of employment was withdrawn, they\r\nwent down fast. Even to look forward was not to hope: the dumb future spoke no\r\ncomfort, offered no promise, gave no inducement to bear present evil in\r\nreliance on future good. A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on\r\nme\u2014a despairing resignation to reach betimes the end of all things earthly.\r\nAlas! When I had full leisure to look on life as life must be looked on by such\r\nas me, I found it but a hopeless desert: tawny sands, with no green fields, no\r\npalm-tree, no well in view. The hopes which are dear to youth, which bear it up\r\nand lead it on, I knew not and dared not know. If they knocked at my heart\r\nsometimes, an inhospitable bar to admission must be inwardly drawn. When they\r\nturned away thus rejected, tears sad enough sometimes flowed: but it could not\r\nbe helped: I dared not give such guests lodging. So mortally did I fear the sin\r\nand weakness of presumption.\r\n\n\r\nReligious reader, you will preach to me a long sermon about what I have just\r\nwritten, and so will you, moralist: and you, stern sage: you, stoic, will\r\nfrown; you, cynic, sneer; you, epicure, laugh. Well, each and all, take it your\r\nown way. I accept the sermon, frown, sneer, and laugh; perhaps you are all\r\nright: and perhaps, circumstanced like me, you would have been, like me, wrong.\r\nThe first month was, indeed, a long, black, heavy month to me.\r\n\n\r\nThe cr\u00e9tin did not seem unhappy. I did my best to feed her well and keep her\r\nwarm, and she only asked food and sunshine, or when that lacked, fire. Her weak\r\nfaculties approved of inertion: her brain, her eyes, her ears, her heart slept\r\ncontent; they could not wake to work, so lethargy was their Paradise.\r\n\n\r\nThree weeks of that vacation were hot, fair, and dry, but the fourth and fifth\r\nwere tempestuous and wet. I do not know why that change in the atmosphere made\r\na cruel impression on me, why the raging storm and beating rain crushed me with\r\na deadlier paralysis than I had experienced while the air had remained serene;\r\nbut so it was; and my nervous system could hardly support what it had for many\r\ndays and nights to undergo in that huge empty house. How I used to pray to\r\nHeaven for consolation and support! With what dread force the conviction would\r\ngrasp me that Fate was my permanent foe, never to be conciliated. I did not, in\r\nmy heart, arraign the mercy or justice of God for this; I concluded it to be a\r\npart of his great plan that some must deeply suffer while they live, and I\r\nthrilled in the certainty that of this number, I was one.\r\n\n\r\nIt was some relief when an aunt of the cr\u00e9tin, a kind old woman, came one day,\r\nand took away my strange, deformed companion. The hapless creature had been at\r\ntimes a heavy charge; I could not take her out beyond the garden, and I could\r\nnot leave her a minute alone: for her poor mind, like her body, was warped: its\r\npropensity was to evil. A vague bent to mischief, an aimless malevolence, made\r\nconstant vigilance indispensable. As she very rarely spoke, and would sit for\r\nhours together moping and mowing, and distorting her features with\r\nindescribable grimaces, it was more like being prisoned with some strange\r\ntameless animal, than associating with a human being. Then there were personal\r\nattentions to be rendered which required the nerve of a hospital nurse; my\r\nresolution was so tried, it sometimes fell dead-sick. These duties should not\r\nhave fallen on me; a servant, now absent, had rendered them hitherto, and in\r\nthe hurry of holiday departure, no substitute to fill this office had been\r\nprovided. This tax and trial were by no means the least I have known in life.\r\nStill, menial and distasteful as they were, my mental pain was far more wasting\r\nand wearing. Attendance on the cr\u00e9tin deprived me often of the power and\r\ninclination to swallow a meal, and sent me faint to the fresh air, and the well\r\nor fountain in the court; but this duty never wrung my heart, or brimmed my\r\neyes, or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten metal.\r\n\n\r\nThe cr\u00e9tin being gone, I was free to walk out. At first I lacked courage to\r\nventure very far from the Rue Fossette, but by degrees I sought the city gates,\r\nand passed them, and then went wandering away far along chauss\u00e9es, through\r\nfields, beyond cemeteries, Catholic and Protestant, beyond farmsteads, to lanes\r\nand little woods, and I know not where. A goad thrust me on, a fever forbade me\r\nto rest; a want of companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most\r\ndeadly famine. I often walked all day, through the burning noon and the arid\r\nafternoon, and the dusk evening, and came back with moonrise.\r\n\n\r\nWhile wandering in solitude, I would sometimes picture the present probable\r\nposition of others, my acquaintance. There was Madame Beck at a cheerful\r\nwatering-place with her children, her mother, and a whole troop of friends who\r\nhad sought the same scene of relaxation. Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre was at Paris, with\r\nher relatives; the other teachers were at their homes. There was Ginevra\r\nFanshawe, whom certain of her connections had carried on a pleasant tour\r\nsouthward. Ginevra seemed to me the happiest. She was on the route of beautiful\r\nscenery; these September suns shone for her on fertile plains, where harvest\r\nand vintage matured under their mellow beam. These gold and crystal moons rose\r\non her vision over blue horizons waved in mounted lines.\r\n\n\r\nBut all this was nothing; I too felt those autumn suns and saw those harvest\r\nmoons, and I almost wished to be covered in with earth and turf, deep out of\r\ntheir influence; for I could not live in their light, nor make them comrades,\r\nnor yield them affection. But Ginevra had a kind of spirit with her, empowered\r\nto give constant strength and comfort, to gladden daylight and embalm darkness;\r\nthe best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained her with his wings,\r\nand canopied her head with his bending form. By True Love was Ginevra followed:\r\nnever could she be alone. Was she insensible to this presence? It seemed to me\r\nimpossible: I could not realize such deadness. I imagined her grateful in\r\nsecret, loving now with reserve; but purposing one day to show how much she\r\nloved: I pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy fondness, and\r\ncomforted by that consciousness: I conceived an electric chord of sympathy\r\nbetween them, a fine chain of mutual understanding, sustaining union through a\r\nseparation of a hundred leagues\u2014carrying, across mound and hollow,\r\ncommunication by prayer and wish. Ginevra gradually became with me a sort of\r\nheroine. One day, perceiving this growing illusion, I said, \u201cI really believe\r\nmy nerves are getting overstretched: my mind has suffered somewhat too much a\r\nmalady is growing upon it\u2014what shall I do? How shall I keep well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIndeed there was no way to keep well under the circumstances. At last a day and\r\nnight of peculiarly agonizing depression were succeeded by physical illness, I\r\ntook perforce to my bed. About this time the Indian summer closed and the\r\nequinoctial storms began; and for nine dark and wet days, of which the hours\r\nrushed on all turbulent, deaf, dishevelled\u2014bewildered with sounding hurricane\u2014I\r\nlay in a strange fever of the nerves and blood. Sleep went quite away. I used\r\nto rise in the night, look round for her, beseech her earnestly to return. A\r\nrattle of the window, a cry of the blast only replied\u2014Sleep never came!\r\n\n\r\nI err. She came once, but in anger. Impatient of my importunity she brought\r\nwith her an avenging dream. By the clock of St. Jean Baptiste, that dream\r\nremained scarce fifteen minutes\u2014a brief space, but sufficing to wring my whole\r\nframe with unknown anguish; to confer a nameless experience that had the hue,\r\nthe mien, the terror, the very tone of a visitation from eternity. Between\r\ntwelve and one that night a cup was forced to my lips, black, strong, strange,\r\ndrawn from no well, but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea.\r\nSuffering, brewed in temporal or calculable measure, and mixed for mortal lips,\r\ntastes not as this suffering tasted. Having drank and woke, I thought all was\r\nover: the end come and past by. Trembling fearfully\u2014as consciousness\r\nreturned\u2014ready to cry out on some fellow-creature to help me, only that I knew\r\nno fellow-creature was near enough to catch the wild summons\u2014Goton in her far\r\ndistant attic could not hear\u2014I rose on my knees in bed. Some fearful hours went\r\nover me: indescribably was I torn, racked and oppressed in mind. Amidst the\r\nhorrors of that dream I think the worst lay here. Methought the well-loved\r\ndead, who had loved me well in life, met me elsewhere, alienated: galled\r\nwas my inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair about the future.\r\nMotive there was none why I should try to recover or wish to live; and yet\r\nquite unendurable was the pitiless and haughty voice in which Death challenged\r\nme to engage his unknown terrors. When I tried to pray I could only utter these\r\nwords: \u201cFrom my youth up Thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMost true was it.\r\n\n\r\nOn bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me to call in a doctor. I would\r\nnot: I thought no doctor could cure me.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening\u2014and I was not delirious: I was in my sane mind, I got up\u2014I dressed\r\nmyself, weak and shaking. The solitude and the stillness of the long dormitory\r\ncould not be borne any longer; the ghastly white beds were turning into\r\nspectres\u2014the coronal of each became a death\u2019s-head, huge and sun-bleached\u2014dead\r\ndreams of an elder world and mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping\r\neyeholes. That evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the\r\nconviction that Fate was of stone, and Hope a false idol\u2014blind, bloodless, and\r\nof granite core. I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining\r\nits climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling as\r\nthey were. It rained still, and blew; but with more clemency, I thought, than\r\nit had poured and raged all day. Twilight was falling, and I deemed its\r\ninfluence pitiful; from the lattice I saw coming night-clouds trailing low like\r\nbanners drooping. It seemed to me that at this hour there was affection and\r\nsorrow in Heaven above for all pain suffered on earth beneath; the weight of my\r\ndreadful dream became alleviated\u2014that insufferable thought of being no more\r\nloved\u2014no more owned, half-yielded to hope of the contrary\u2014I was sure this hope\r\nwould shine clearer if I got out from under this house-roof, which was crushing\r\nas the slab of a tomb, and went outside the city to a certain quiet hill, a\r\nlong way distant in the fields. Covered with a cloak (I could not be delirious,\r\nfor I had sense and recollection to put on warm clothing), forth I set. The\r\nbells of a church arrested me in passing; they seemed to call me in to the\r\nsalut, and I went in. Any solemn rite, any spectacle of sincere worship,\r\nany opening for appeal to God was as welcome to me then as bread to one in\r\nextremity of want. I knelt down with others on the stone pavement. It was an\r\nold solemn church, its pervading gloom not gilded but purpled by light shed\r\nthrough stained glass.\r\n\n\r\nFew worshippers were assembled, and, the salut over, half of them\r\ndeparted. I discovered soon that those left remained to confess. I did not\r\nstir. Carefully every door of the church was shut; a holy quiet sank upon, and\r\na solemn shade gathered about us. After a space, breathless and spent in\r\nprayer, a penitent approached the confessional. I watched. She whispered her\r\navowal; her shrift was whispered back; she returned consoled. Another went, and\r\nanother. A pale lady, kneeling near me, said in a low, kind voice:\u2014\u201cGo you now,\r\nI am not quite prepared.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMechanically obedient, I rose and went. I knew what I was about; my mind had\r\nrun over the intent with lightning-speed. To take this step could not make me\r\nmore wretched than I was; it might soothe me.\r\n\n\r\nThe priest within the confessional never turned his eyes to regard me; he only\r\nquietly inclined his ear to my lips. He might be a good man, but this duty had\r\nbecome to him a sort of form: he went through it with the phlegm of custom. I\r\nhesitated; of the formula of confession I was ignorant: instead of commencing,\r\nthen, with the prelude usual, I said:\u2014\u201cMon p\u00e8re, je suis Protestante.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe directly turned. He was not a native priest: of that class, the cast of\r\nphysiognomy is, almost invariably, grovelling: I saw by his profile and brow he\r\nwas a Frenchman; though grey and advanced in years, he did not, I think, lack\r\nfeeling or intelligence. He inquired, not unkindly, why, being a Protestant, I\r\ncame to him?\r\n\n\r\nI said I was perishing for a word of advice or an accent of comfort. I had been\r\nliving for some weeks quite alone; I had been ill; I had a pressure of\r\naffliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer endure the weight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it a sin, a crime?\u201d he inquired, somewhat startled. I reassured him on\r\nthis point, and, as well as I could, I showed him the mere outline of my\r\nexperience.\r\n\n\r\nHe looked thoughtful, surprised, puzzled. \u201cYou take me unawares,\u201d said he. \u201cI\r\nhave not had such a case as yours before: ordinarily we know our routine, and\r\nare prepared; but this makes a great break in the common course of confession.\r\nI am hardly furnished with counsel fitting the circumstances.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course, I had not expected he would be; but the mere relief of communication\r\nin an ear which was human and sentient, yet consecrated\u2014the mere pouring out of\r\nsome portion of long accumulating, long pent-up pain into a vessel whence it\r\ncould not be again diffused\u2014had done me good. I was already solaced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust I go, father?\u201d I asked of him as he sat silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d he said kindly\u2014and I am sure he was a kind man: he had a\r\ncompassionate eye\u2014\u201cfor the present you had better go: but I assure you your\r\nwords have struck me. Confession, like other things, is apt to become formal\r\nand trivial with habit. You have come and poured your heart out; a thing seldom\r\ndone. I would fain think your case over, and take it with me to my oratory.\r\nWere you of our faith I should know what to say\u2014a mind so tossed can find\r\nrepose but in the bosom of retreat, and the punctual practice of piety. The\r\nworld, it is well known, has no satisfaction for that class of natures. Holy\r\nmen have bidden penitents like you to hasten their path upward by penance,\r\nself-denial, and difficult good works. Tears are given them here for meat and\r\ndrink\u2014bread of affliction and waters of affliction\u2014their recompence comes\r\nhereafter. It is my own conviction that these impressions under which you are\r\nsmarting are messengers from God to bring you back to the true Church. You were\r\nmade for our faith: depend upon it our faith alone could heal and help\r\nyou\u2014Protestantism is altogether too dry, cold, prosaic for you. The further I\r\nlook into this matter, the more plainly I see it is entirely out of the common\r\norder of things. On no account would I lose sight of you. Go, my daughter, for\r\nthe present; but return to me again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rose and thanked him. I was withdrawing when he signed me to return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must not come to this church,\u201d said he: \u201cI see you are ill, and this\r\nchurch is too cold; you must come to my house: I live\u2014\u2014\u201d (and he gave me his\r\naddress). \u201cBe there to-morrow morning at ten.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn reply to this appointment, I only bowed; and pulling down my veil, and\r\ngathering round me my cloak, I glided away.\r\n\n\r\nDid I, do you suppose, reader, contemplate venturing again within that worthy\r\npriest\u2019s reach? As soon should I have thought of walking into a Babylonish\r\nfurnace. That priest had arms which could influence me: he was naturally kind,\r\nwith a sentimental French kindness, to whose softness I knew myself not wholly\r\nimpervious. Without respecting some sorts of affection, there was hardly any\r\nsort having a fibre of root in reality, which I could rely on my force wholly\r\nto withstand. Had I gone to him, he would have shown me all that was tender,\r\nand comforting, and gentle, in the honest Popish superstition. Then he would\r\nhave tried to kindle, blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works. I know not\r\nhow it would all have ended. We all think ourselves strong in some points; we\r\nall know ourselves weak in many; the probabilities are that had I visited\r\nNumero 10, Rue des Mages, at the hour and day appointed, I might just now,\r\ninstead of writing this heretic narrative, be counting my beads in the cell of\r\na certain Carmelite convent on the Boulevard of Cr\u00e9cy, in Villette. There was\r\nsomething of F\u00e9n\u00e9lon about that benign old priest; and whatever most of his\r\nbrethren may be, and whatever I may think of his Church and creed (and I like\r\nneither), of himself I must ever retain a grateful recollection. He was kind\r\nwhen I needed kindness; he did me good. May Heaven bless him!\r\n\n\r\nTwilight had passed into night, and the lamps were lit in the streets ere I\r\nissued from that sombre church. To turn back was now become possible to me; the\r\nwild longing to breathe this October wind on the little hill far without the\r\ncity walls had ceased to be an imperative impulse, and was softened into a wish\r\nwith which Reason could cope: she put it down, and I turned, as I thought, to\r\nthe Rue Fossette. But I had become involved in a part of the city with which I\r\nwas not familiar; it was the old part, and full of narrow streets of\r\npicturesque, ancient, and mouldering houses. I was much too weak to be very\r\ncollected, and I was still too careless of my own welfare and safety to be\r\ncautious; I grew embarrassed; I got immeshed in a network of turns unknown. I\r\nwas lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger.\r\n\n\r\nIf the storm had lulled a little at sunset, it made up now for lost time.\r\nStrong and horizontal thundered the current of the wind from north-west to\r\nsouth-east; it brought rain like spray, and sometimes a sharp hail, like shot:\r\nit was cold and pierced me to the vitals. I bent my head to meet it, but it\r\nbeat me back. My heart did not fail at all in this conflict; I only wished that\r\nI had wings and could ascend the gale, spread and repose my pinions on its\r\nstrength, career in its course, sweep where it swept. While wishing this, I\r\nsuddenly felt colder where before I was cold, and more powerless where before I\r\nwas weak. I tried to reach the porch of a great building near, but the mass of\r\nfrontage and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes. Instead of\r\nsinking on the steps as I intended, I seemed to pitch headlong down an abyss. I\r\nremember no more.\r\n\n"}
{"17": "\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nAULD LANG SYNE.\n\r\nWhere my soul went during that swoon I cannot tell. Whatever she saw, or\r\nwherever she travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept her own\r\nsecret; never whispering a word to Memory, and baffling imagination by an\r\nindissoluble silence. She may have gone upward, and come in sight of her\r\neternal home, hoping for leave to rest now, and deeming that her painful union\r\nwith matter was at last dissolved. While she so deemed, an angel may have\r\nwarned her away from heaven\u2019s threshold, and, guiding her weeping down, have\r\nbound her, once more, all shuddering and unwilling, to that poor frame, cold\r\nand wasted, of whose companionship she was grown more than weary.\r\n\n\r\nI know she re-entered her prison with pain, with reluctance, with a moan and a\r\nlong shiver. The divorced mates, Spirit and Substance, were hard to re-unite:\r\nthey greeted each other, not in an embrace, but a racking sort of struggle. The\r\nreturning sense of sight came upon me, red, as if it swam in blood; suspended\r\nhearing rushed back loud, like thunder; consciousness revived in fear: I sat up\r\nappalled, wondering into what region, amongst what strange beings I was waking.\r\nAt first I knew nothing I looked on: a wall was not a wall\u2014a lamp not a lamp. I\r\nshould have understood what we call a ghost, as well as I did the commonest\r\nobject: which is another way of intimating that all my eye rested on struck it\r\nas spectral. But the faculties soon settled each in his place; the life-machine\r\npresently resumed its wonted and regular working.\r\n\n\r\nStill, I knew not where I was; only in time I saw I had been removed from the\r\nspot where I fell: I lay on no portico-step; night and tempest were excluded by\r\nwalls, windows, and ceiling. Into some house I had been carried\u2014but what house?\r\n\n\r\nI could only think of the pensionnat in the Rue Fossette. Still half-dreaming,\r\nI tried hard to discover in what room they had put me; whether the great\r\ndormitory, or one of the little dormitories. I was puzzled, because I could not\r\nmake the glimpses of furniture I saw accord with my knowledge of any of these\r\napartments. The empty white beds were wanting, and the long line of large\r\nwindows. \u201cSurely,\u201d thought I, \u201cit is not to Madame Beck\u2019s own chamber they have\r\ncarried me!\u201d And here my eye fell on an easy-chair covered with blue damask.\r\nOther seats, cushioned to match, dawned on me by degrees; and at last I took in\r\nthe complete fact of a pleasant parlour, with a wood fire on a clear-shining\r\nhearth, a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved a ground of shaded\r\nfawn; pale walls over which a slight but endless garland of azure\r\nforget-me-nots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad gold leaves and\r\ntendrils. A gilded mirror filled up the space between two windows, curtained\r\namply with blue damask. In this mirror I saw myself laid, not in bed, but on a\r\nsofa. I looked spectral; my eyes larger and more hollow, my hair darker than\r\nwas natural, by contrast with my thin and ashen face. It was obvious, not only\r\nfrom the furniture, but from the position of windows, doors, and fireplace,\r\nthat this was an unknown room in an unknown house.\r\n\n\r\nHardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet settled; for, as I gazed at\r\nthe blue arm-chair, it appeared to grow familiar; so did a certain\r\nscroll-couch, and not less so the round centre-table, with a blue-covering,\r\nbordered with autumn-tinted foliage; and, above all, two little footstools with\r\nworked covers, and a small ebony-framed chair, of which the seat and back were\r\nalso worked with groups of brilliant flowers on a dark ground.\r\n\n\r\nStruck with these things, I explored further. Strange to say, old acquaintance\r\nwere all about me, and \u201cauld lang syne\u201d smiled out of every nook. There were\r\ntwo oval miniatures over the mantel-piece, of which I knew by heart the pearls\r\nabout the high and powdered \u201cheads;\u201d the velvets circling the white throats;\r\nthe swell of the full muslin kerchiefs: the pattern of the lace sleeve-ruffles.\r\nUpon the mantel-shelf there were two china vases, some relics of a diminutive\r\ntea-service, as smooth as enamel and as thin as egg-shell, and a white centre\r\nornament, a classic group in alabaster, preserved under glass. Of all these\r\nthings I could have told the peculiarities, numbered the flaws or cracks, like\r\nany clairvoyante. Above all, there was a pair of handscreens, with\r\nelaborate pencil-drawings finished like line engravings; these, my very eyes\r\nached at beholding again, recalling hours when they had followed, stroke by\r\nstroke and touch by touch, a tedious, feeble, finical, school-girl pencil held\r\nin these fingers, now so skeleton-like.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was I? Not only in what spot of the world, but in what year of our Lord?\r\nFor all these objects were of past days, and of a distant country. Ten years\r\nago I bade them good-by; since my fourteenth year they and I had never met. I\r\ngasped audibly, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA shape hitherto unnoticed, stirred, rose, came forward: a shape inharmonious\r\nwith the environment, serving only to complicate the riddle further. This was\r\nno more than a sort of native bonne, in a common-place bonne\u2019s cap and\r\nprint-dress. She spoke neither French nor English, and I could get no\r\nintelligence from her, not understanding her phrases of dialect. But she bathed\r\nmy temples and forehead with some cool and perfumed water, and then she\r\nheightened the cushion on which I reclined, made signs that I was not to speak,\r\nand resumed her post at the foot of the sofa.\r\n\n\r\nShe was busy knitting; her eyes thus drawn from me, I could gaze on her without\r\ninterruption. I did mightily wonder how she came there, or what she could have\r\nto do among the scenes, or with the days of my girlhood. Still more I marvelled\r\nwhat those scenes and days could now have to do with me.\r\n\n\r\nToo weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery, I tried to settle it by saying\r\nit was a mistake, a dream, a fever-fit; and yet I knew there could be no\r\nmistake, and that I was not sleeping, and I believed I was sane. I wished the\r\nroom had not been so well lighted, that I might not so clearly have seen the\r\nlittle pictures, the ornaments, the screens, the worked chair. All these\r\nobjects, as well as the blue-damask furniture, were, in fact, precisely the\r\nsame, in every minutest detail, with those I so well remembered, and with which\r\nI had been so thoroughly intimate, in the drawing-room of my godmother\u2019s house\r\nat Bretton. Methought the apartment only was changed, being of different\r\nproportions and dimensions.\r\n\n\r\nI thought of Bedreddin Hassan, transported in his sleep from Cairo to the gates\r\nof Damascus. Had a Genius stooped his dark wing down the storm to whose stress\r\nI had succumbed, and gathering me from the church-steps, and \u201crising high into\r\nthe air,\u201d as the eastern tale said, had he borne me over land and ocean, and\r\nlaid me quietly down beside a hearth of Old England? But no; I knew the fire of\r\nthat hearth burned before its Lares no more\u2014it went out long ago, and the\r\nhousehold gods had been carried elsewhere.\r\n\n\r\nThe bonne turned again to survey me, and seeing my eyes wide open, and, I\r\nsuppose, deeming their expression perturbed and excited, she put down her\r\nknitting. I saw her busied for a moment at a little stand; she poured out\r\nwater, and measured drops from a phial: glass in hand, she approached me. What\r\ndark-tinged draught might she now be offering? what Genii-elixir or\r\nMagi-distillation?\r\n\n\r\nIt was too late to inquire\u2014I had swallowed it passively, and at once. A tide of\r\nquiet thought now came gently caressing my brain; softer and softer rose the\r\nflow, with tepid undulations smoother than balm. The pain of weakness left my\r\nlimbs, my muscles slept. I lost power to move; but, losing at the same time\r\nwish, it was no privation. That kind bonne placed a screen between me and the\r\nlamp; I saw her rise to do this, but do not remember seeing her resume her\r\nplace: in the interval between the two acts, I \u201cfell on sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt waking, lo! all was again changed. The light of high day surrounded me; not,\r\nindeed, a warm, summer light, but the leaden gloom of raw and blustering\r\nautumn. I felt sure now that I was in the pensionnat\u2014sure by the beating rain\r\non the casement; sure by the \u201cwuther\u201d of wind amongst trees, denoting a garden\r\noutside; sure by the chill, the whiteness, the solitude, amidst which I lay. I\r\nsay whiteness\u2014for the dimity curtains, dropped before a French bed,\r\nbounded my view.\r\n\n\r\nI lifted them; I looked out. My eye, prepared to take in the range of a long,\r\nlarge, and whitewashed chamber, blinked baffled, on encountering the limited\r\narea of a small cabinet\u2014a cabinet with sea-green walls; also, instead of five\r\nwide and naked windows, there was one high lattice, shaded with muslin\r\nfestoons: instead of two dozen little stands of painted wood, each holding a\r\nbasin and an ewer, there was a toilette-table dressed, like a lady for a ball,\r\nin a white robe over a pink skirt; a polished and large glass crowned, and a\r\npretty pin-cushion frilled with lace, adorned it. This toilette, together with\r\na small, low, green and white chintz arm-chair, a washstand topped with a\r\nmarble slab, and supplied with utensils of pale-green ware, sufficiently\r\nfurnished the tiny chamber.\r\n\n\r\nReader; I felt alarmed! Why? you will ask. What was there in this simple and\r\nsomewhat pretty sleeping-closet to startle the most timid? Merely this\u2014These\r\narticles of furniture could not be real, solid arm-chairs, looking-glasses, and\r\nwashstands\u2014they must be the ghosts of such articles; or, if this were denied as\r\ntoo wild an hypothesis\u2014and, confounded as I was, I did deny it\u2014there\r\nremained but to conclude that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of\r\nmind; in short, that I was very ill and delirious: and even then, mine was the\r\nstrangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim.\r\n\n\r\nI knew\u2014I was obliged to know\u2014the green chintz of that little chair; the little\r\nsnug chair itself, the carved, shining-black, foliated frame of that glass; the\r\nsmooth, milky-green of the china vessels on the stand; the very stand too, with\r\nits top of grey marble, splintered at one corner;\u2014all these I was compelled to\r\nrecognise and to hail, as last night I had, perforce, recognised and hailed the\r\nrosewood, the drapery, the porcelain, of the drawing-room.\r\n\n\r\nBretton! Bretton! and ten years ago shone reflected in that mirror. And why did\r\nBretton and my fourteenth year haunt me thus? Why, if they came at all, did\r\nthey not return complete? Why hovered before my distempered vision the mere\r\nfurniture, while the rooms and the locality were gone? As to that pincushion\r\nmade of crimson satin, ornamented with gold beads and frilled with thread-lace,\r\nI had the same right to know it as to know the screens\u2014I had made it myself.\r\nRising with a start from the bed, I took the cushion in my hand and examined\r\nit. There was the cipher \u201cL. L. B.\u201d formed in gold beds, and surrounded with an\r\noval wreath embroidered in white silk. These were the initials of my\r\ngodmother\u2019s name\u2014Louisa Lucy Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I in England? Am I at Bretton?\u201d I muttered; and hastily pulling up the\r\nblind with which the lattice was shrouded, I looked out to try and discover\r\nwhere I was; half-prepared to meet the calm, old, handsome buildings and\r\nclean grey pavement of St. Ann\u2019s Street, and to see at the end the towers of\r\nthe minster: or, if otherwise, fully expectant of a town view somewhere, a rue\r\nin Villette, if not a street in a pleasant and ancient English city.\r\n\n\r\nI looked, on the contrary, through a frame of leafage, clustering round the\r\nhigh lattice, and forth thence to a grassy mead-like level, a lawn-terrace with\r\ntrees rising from the lower ground beyond\u2014high forest-trees, such as I had not\r\nseen for many a day. They were now groaning under the gale of October, and\r\nbetween their trunks I traced the line of an avenue, where yellow leaves lay in\r\nheaps and drifts, or were whirled singly before the sweeping west wind.\r\nWhatever landscape might lie further must have been flat, and these tall\r\nbeeches shut it out. The place seemed secluded, and was to me quite strange: I\r\ndid not know it at all.\r\n\n\r\nOnce more I lay down. My bed stood in a little alcove; on turning my face to\r\nthe wall, the room with its bewildering accompaniments became excluded.\r\nExcluded? No! For as I arranged my position in this hope, behold, on the green\r\nspace between the divided and looped-up curtains, hung a broad, gilded\r\npicture-frame enclosing a portrait. It was drawn\u2014well drawn, though but a\r\nsketch\u2014in water-colours; a head, a boy\u2019s head, fresh, life-like, speaking, and\r\nanimated. It seemed a youth of sixteen, fair-complexioned, with sanguine health\r\nin his cheek; hair long, not dark, and with a sunny sheen; penetrating eyes, an\r\narch mouth, and a gay smile. On the whole a most pleasant face to look at,\r\nespecially for those claiming a right to that youth\u2019s affections\u2014parents, for\r\ninstance, or sisters. Any romantic little school-girl might almost have loved\r\nit in its frame. Those eyes looked as if when somewhat older they would flash a\r\nlightning-response to love: I cannot tell whether they kept in store the\r\nsteady-beaming shine of faith. For whatever sentiment met him in form too\r\nfacile, his lips menaced, beautifully but surely, caprice and light esteem.\r\n\n\r\nStriving to take each new discovery as quietly as I could, I whispered to\r\nmyself\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! that portrait used to hang in the breakfast-room, over the mantel-piece:\r\nsomewhat too high, as I thought. I well remember how I used to mount a\r\nmusic-stool for the purpose of unhooking it, holding it in my hand, and\r\nsearching into those bonny wells of eyes, whose glance under their hazel lashes\r\nseemed like a pencilled laugh; and well I liked to note the colouring of the\r\ncheek, and the expression of the mouth.\u201d I hardly believed fancy could improve\r\non the curve of that mouth, or of the chin; even my ignorance knew that\r\nboth were beautiful, and pondered perplexed over this doubt: \u201cHow it was that\r\nwhat charmed so much, could at the same time so keenly pain?\u201d Once, by way of\r\ntest, I took little Missy Home, and, lifting her in my arms, told her to look\r\nat the picture.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like it, Polly?\u201d I asked. She never answered, but gazed long, and at\r\nlast a darkness went trembling through her sensitive eye, as she said, \u201cPut me\r\ndown.\u201d So I put her down, saying to myself. \u201cThe child feels it too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll these things do I now think over, adding, \u201cHe had his faults, yet scarce\r\never was a finer nature; liberal, suave, impressible.\u201d My reflections closed in\r\nan audibly pronounced word, \u201cGraham!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham!\u201d echoed a sudden voice at the bedside. \u201cDo you want Graham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked. The plot was but thickening; the wonder but culminating. If it was\r\nstrange to see that well-remembered pictured form on the wall, still stranger\r\nwas it to turn and behold the equally well-remembered living form opposite\u2014a\r\nwoman, a lady, most real and substantial, tall, well-attired, wearing widow\u2019s\r\nsilk, and such a cap as best became her matron and motherly braids of hair.\r\nHers, too, was a good face; too marked, perhaps, now for beauty, but not for\r\nsense or character. She was little changed; something sterner, something more\r\nrobust\u2014but she was my godmother: still the distinct vision of Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\nI kept quiet, yet internally I was much agitated: my pulse fluttered,\r\nand the blood left my cheek, which turned cold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, where am I?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn a very safe asylum; well protected for the present; make your mind quite\r\neasy till you get a little better; you look ill this morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so entirely bewildered, I do not know whether I can trust my senses at\r\nall, or whether they are misleading me in every particular: but you speak\r\nEnglish, do you not, madam?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should think you might hear that: it would puzzle me to hold a long\r\ndiscourse in French.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not come from England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am lately arrived thence. Have you been long in this country? You seem to\r\nknow my son?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo, I, madam? Perhaps I do. Your son\u2014the picture there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is his portrait as a youth. While looking at it, you pronounced his\r\nname.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI speak to Mrs. Bretton, formerly of Bretton, \u2014\u2014shire?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite right; and you, I am told, are an English teacher in a foreign school\r\nhere: my son recognised you as such.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow was I found, madam, and by whom?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy son shall tell you that by-and-by,\u201d said she; \u201cbut at present you are too\r\nconfused and weak for conversation: try to eat some breakfast, and then sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNotwithstanding all I had undergone\u2014the bodily fatigue, the perturbation of\r\nspirits, the exposure to weather\u2014it seemed that I was better: the fever, the\r\nreal malady which had oppressed my frame, was abating; for, whereas during the\r\nlast nine days I had taken no solid food, and suffered from continual thirst,\r\nthis morning, on breakfast being offered, I experienced a craving for\r\nnourishment: an inward faintness which caused me eagerly to taste the tea this\r\nlady offered, and to eat the morsel of dry toast she allowed in accompaniment.\r\nIt was only a morsel, but it sufficed; keeping up my strength till some two or\r\nthree hours afterwards, when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth and a\r\nbiscuit.\r\n\n\r\nAs evening began to darken, and the ceaseless blast still blew wild and cold,\r\nand the rain streamed on, deluge-like, I grew weary\u2014very weary of my bed. The\r\nroom, though pretty, was small: I felt it confining: I longed for a change. The\r\nincreasing chill and gathering gloom, too, depressed me; I wanted to see\u2014to\r\nfeel firelight. Besides, I kept thinking of the son of that tall matron: when\r\nshould I see him? Certainly not till I left my room.\r\n\n\r\nAt last the bonne came to make my bed for the night. She prepared to wrap me in\r\na blanket and place me in the little chintz chair; but, declining these\r\nattentions, I proceeded to dress myself:\r\n\n\r\nThe business was just achieved, and I was sitting down to take breath, when\r\nMrs. Bretton once more appeared.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDressed!\u201d she exclaimed, smiling with that smile I so well knew\u2014a pleasant\r\nsmile, though not soft. \u201cYou are quite better then? Quite strong\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe spoke to me so much as of old she used to speak that I almost fancied she\r\nwas beginning to know me. There was the same sort of patronage in her voice and\r\nmanner that, as a girl, I had always experienced from her\u2014a patronage I yielded\r\nto and even liked; it was not founded on conventional grounds of superior\r\nwealth or station (in the last particular there had never been any inequality;\r\nher degree was mine); but on natural reasons of physical advantage: it was the\r\nshelter the tree gives the herb. I put a request without further ceremony.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo let me go down-stairs, madam; I am so cold and dull here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI desire nothing better, if you are strong enough to bear the change,\u201d was her\r\nreply. \u201cCome then; here is an arm.\u201d And she offered me hers: I took it, and we\r\ndescended one flight of carpeted steps to a landing where a tall door, standing\r\nopen, gave admission into the blue-damask room. How pleasant it was in its air\r\nof perfect domestic comfort! How warm in its amber lamp-light and vermilion\r\nfire-flush! To render the picture perfect, tea stood ready on the table\u2014an\r\nEnglish tea, whereof the whole shining service glanced at me familiarly; from\r\nthe solid silver urn, of antique pattern, and the massive pot of the same\r\nmetal, to the thin porcelain cups, dark with purple and gilding. I knew the\r\nvery seed-cake of peculiar form, baked in a peculiar mould, which always had a\r\nplace on the tea-table at Bretton. Graham liked it, and there it was as of\r\nyore\u2014set before Graham\u2019s plate with the silver knife and fork beside it. Graham\r\nwas then expected to tea: Graham was now, perhaps, in the house; ere many\r\nminutes I might see him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit down\u2014sit down,\u201d said my conductress, as my step faltered a little in\r\npassing to the hearth. She seated me on the sofa, but I soon passed behind it,\r\nsaying the fire was too hot; in its shade I found another seat which suited me\r\nbetter. Mrs. Bretton was never wont to make a fuss about any person or\r\nanything; without remonstrance she suffered me to have my own way. She made the\r\ntea, and she took up the newspaper. I liked to watch every action of my\r\ngodmother; all her movements were so young: she must have been now above fifty,\r\nyet neither her sinews nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age.\r\nThough portly, she was alert, and though serene, she was at times\r\nimpetuous\u2014good health and an excellent temperament kept her green as in her\r\nspring.\r\n\n\r\nWhile she read, I perceived she listened\u2014listened for her son. She was not the\r\nwoman ever to confess herself uneasy, but there was yet no lull in the weather,\r\nand if Graham were out in that hoarse wind\u2014roaring still unsatisfied\u2014I well\r\nknew his mother\u2019s heart would be out with him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTen minutes behind his time,\u201d said she, looking at her watch; then, in another\r\nminute, a lifting of her eyes from the page, and a slight inclination of her\r\nhead towards the door, denoted that she heard some sound. Presently her brow\r\ncleared; and then even my ear, less practised, caught the iron clash of a gate\r\nswung to, steps on gravel, lastly the door-bell. He was come. His mother filled\r\nthe teapot from the urn, she drew nearer the hearth the stuffed and cushioned\r\nblue chair\u2014her own chair by right, but I saw there was one who might with\r\nimpunity usurp it. And when that one came up the stairs\u2014which he soon\r\ndid, after, I suppose, some such attention to the toilet as the wild and wet\r\nnight rendered necessary, and strode straight in\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it you, Graham?\u201d said his mother, hiding a glad smile and speaking curtly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho else should it be, mamma?\u201d demanded the Unpunctual, possessing himself\r\nirreverently of the abdicated throne.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you deserve cold tea, for being late?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall not get my deserts, for the urn sings cheerily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWheel yourself to the table, lazy boy: no seat will serve you but mine; if you\r\nhad one spark of a sense of propriety, you would always leave that chair for\r\nthe Old Lady.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo I should; only the dear Old Lady persists in leaving it for me. How is your\r\npatient, mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill she come forward and speak for herself?\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, turning to my\r\ncorner; and at this invitation, forward I came. Graham courteously rose up to\r\ngreet me. He stood tall on the hearth, a figure justifying his mother\u2019s\r\nunconcealed pride.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo you are come down,\u201d said he; \u201cyou must be better then\u2014much better. I\r\nscarcely expected we should meet thus, or here. I was alarmed last night, and\r\nif I had not been forced to hurry away to a dying patient, I certainly would\r\nnot have left you; but my mother herself is something of a doctress, and Martha\r\nan excellent nurse. I saw the case was a fainting-fit, not necessarily\r\ndangerous. What brought it on, I have yet to learn, and all particulars;\r\nmeantime, I trust you really do feel better?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cMuch better, I thank you, Dr. John.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor, reader, this tall young man\u2014this darling son\u2014this host of mine\u2014this Graham\r\nBretton, was Dr. John: he, and no other; and, what is more, I\r\nascertained this identity scarcely with surprise. What is more, when I heard\r\nGraham\u2019s step on the stairs, I knew what manner of figure would enter, and for\r\nwhose aspect to prepare my eyes. The discovery was not of to-day, its dawn had\r\npenetrated my perceptions long since. Of course I remembered young Bretton\r\nwell; and though ten years (from sixteen to twenty-six) may greatly change the\r\nboy as they mature him to the man, yet they could bring no such utter\r\ndifference as would suffice wholly to blind my eyes, or baffle my memory. Dr.\r\nJohn Graham Bretton retained still an affinity to the youth of sixteen: he had\r\nhis eyes; he had some of his features; to wit, all the excellently-moulded\r\nlower half of the face; I found him out soon. I first recognised him on that\r\noccasion, noted several chapters back, when my unguardedly-fixed attention had\r\ndrawn on me the mortification of an implied rebuke. Subsequent observation\r\nconfirmed, in every point, that early surmise. I traced in the gesture, the\r\nport, and the habits of his manhood, all his boy\u2019s promise. I heard in his now\r\ndeep tones the accent of former days. Certain turns of phrase, peculiar to him\r\nof old, were peculiar to him still; and so was many a trick of eye and lip,\r\nmany a smile, many a sudden ray levelled from the irid, under his\r\nwell-charactered brow.\r\n\n\r\nTo say anything on the subject, to hint at my discovery, had not\r\nsuited my habits of thought, or assimilated with my system of feeling. On the\r\ncontrary, I had preferred to keep the matter to myself. I liked entering his\r\npresence covered with a cloud he had not seen through, while he stood before me\r\nunder a ray of special illumination which shone all partial over his head,\r\ntrembled about his feet, and cast light no farther.\r\n\n\r\nWell I knew that to him it could make little difference, were I to come forward\r\nand announce, \u201cThis is Lucy Snowe!\u201d So I kept back in my teacher\u2019s place; and\r\nas he never asked my name, so I never gave it. He heard me called \u201cMiss,\u201d and\r\n\u201cMiss Lucy;\u201d he never heard the surname, \u201cSnowe.\u201d As to spontaneous\r\nrecognition\u2014though I, perhaps, was still less changed than he\u2014the idea never\r\napproached his mind, and why should I suggest it?\r\n\n\r\nDuring tea, Dr. John was kind, as it was his nature to be; that meal over, and\r\nthe tray carried out, he made a cosy arrangement of the cushions in a corner of\r\nthe sofa, and obliged me to settle amongst them. He and his mother also drew to\r\nthe fire, and ere we had sat ten minutes, I caught the eye of the latter\r\nfastened steadily upon me. Women are certainly quicker in some things than men.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she exclaimed, presently, \u201cI have seldom seen a stronger likeness!\r\nGraham, have you observed it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cObserved what? What ails the Old Lady now? How you stare, mamma! One would\r\nthink you had an attack of second sight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me, Graham, of whom does that young lady remind you?\u201d pointing to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma, you put her out of countenance. I often tell you abruptness is your\r\nfault; remember, too, that to you she is a stranger, and does not know your\r\nways.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, when she looks down; now, when she turns sideways, who is she like,\r\nGraham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, mamma, since you propound the riddle, I think you ought to solve it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you have known her some time, you say\u2014ever since you first began to attend\r\nthe school in the Rue Fossette:\u2014yet you never mentioned to me that singular\r\nresemblance!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could not mention a thing of which I never thought, and which I do not now\r\nacknowledge. What can you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStupid boy! look at her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham did look: but this was not to be endured; I saw how it must end, so I\r\nthought it best to anticipate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John,\u201d I said, \u201chas had so much to do and think of, since he and I shook\r\nhands at our last parting in St. Ann\u2019s Street, that, while I readily found out\r\nMr. Graham Bretton, some months ago, it never occurred to me as possible that\r\nhe should recognise Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe! I thought so! I knew it!\u201d cried Mrs. Bretton. And she at once\r\nstepped across the hearth and kissed me. Some ladies would, perhaps, have made\r\na great bustle upon such a discovery without being particularly glad of it; but\r\nit was not my godmother\u2019s habit to make a bustle, and she preferred all\r\nsentimental demonstrations in bas-relief. So she and I got over the surprise\r\nwith few words and a single salute; yet I daresay she was pleased, and I know I\r\nwas. While we renewed old acquaintance, Graham, sitting opposite, silently\r\ndisposed of his paroxysm of astonishment.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma calls me a stupid boy, and I think I am so,\u201d at length he said; \u201cfor,\r\nupon my honour, often as I have seen you, I never once suspected this fact: and\r\nyet I perceive it all now. Lucy Snowe! To be sure! I recollect her perfectly,\r\nand there she sits; not a doubt of it. But,\u201d he added, \u201cyou surely have not\r\nknown me as an old acquaintance all this time, and never mentioned it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I have,\u201d was my answer.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John commented not. I supposed he regarded my silence as eccentric, but he\r\nwas indulgent in refraining from censure. I daresay, too, he would have deemed\r\nit impertinent to have interrogated me very closely, to have asked me the why\r\nand wherefore of my reserve; and, though he might feel a little curious, the\r\nimportance of the case was by no means such as to tempt curiosity to infringe\r\non discretion.\r\n\n\r\nFor my part, I just ventured to inquire whether he remembered the circumstance\r\nof my once looking at him very fixedly; for the slight annoyance he had\r\nbetrayed on that occasion still lingered sore on my mind.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I do!\u201d said he: \u201cI think I was even cross with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou considered me a little bold; perhaps?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Only, shy and retiring as your general manner was, I wondered what\r\npersonal or facial enormity in me proved so magnetic to your usually averted\r\neyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see how it was now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd here Mrs. Bretton broke in with many, many questions about past times; and\r\nfor her satisfaction I had to recur to gone-by troubles, to explain causes of\r\nseeming estrangement, to touch on single-handed conflict with Life, with Death,\r\nwith Grief, with Fate. Dr. John listened, saying little. He and she then told\r\nme of changes they had known: even with them all had not gone smoothly, and\r\nfortune had retrenched her once abundant gifts. But so courageous a mother,\r\nwith such a champion in her son, was well fitted to fight a good fight with the\r\nworld, and to prevail ultimately. Dr. John himself was one of those on whose\r\nbirth benign planets have certainly smiled. Adversity might set against him her\r\nmost sullen front: he was the man to beat her down with smiles. Strong and\r\ncheerful, and firm and courteous; not rash, yet valiant; he was the aspirant to\r\nwoo Destiny herself, and to win from her stone eyeballs a beam almost loving.\r\n\n\r\nIn the profession he had adopted, his success was now quite decided. Within the\r\nlast three months he had taken this house (a small ch\u00e2teau, they told me, about\r\nhalf a league without the Porte de Cr\u00e9cy); this country site being chosen for\r\nthe sake of his mother\u2019s health, with which town air did not now agree. Hither\r\nhe had invited Mrs. Bretton, and she, on leaving England, had brought with her\r\nsuch residue furniture of the former St. Ann\u2019s Street mansion as she had\r\nthought fit to keep unsold. Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs,\r\nand the wraiths of looking-glasses, tea-urns, and teacups.\r\n\n\r\nAs the clock struck eleven, Dr. John stopped his mother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe must retire now,\u201d he said; \u201cshe is beginning to look very pale.\r\nTo-morrow I will venture to put some questions respecting the cause of her loss\r\nof health. She is much changed, indeed, since last July, when I saw her enact\r\nwith no little spirit the part of a very killing fine gentleman. As to last\r\nnight\u2019s catastrophe, I am sure thereby hangs a tale, but we will inquire no\r\nfurther this evening. Good-night, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so he kindly led me to the door, and holding a wax-candle, lighted me up\r\nthe one flight of stairs.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had said my prayers, and when I was undressed and laid down, I felt that\r\nI still had friends. Friends, not professing vehement attachment, not offering\r\nthe tender solace of well-matched and congenial relationship; on whom,\r\ntherefore, but moderate demand of affection was to be made, of whom but\r\nmoderate expectation formed; but towards whom my heart softened instinctively,\r\nand yearned with an importunate gratitude, which I entreated Reason betimes to\r\ncheck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not let me think of them too often, too much, too fondly,\u201d I implored: \u201clet\r\nme be content with a temperate draught of this living stream: let me not run\r\nathirst, and apply passionately to its welcome waters: let me not imagine in\r\nthem a sweeter taste than earth\u2019s fountains know. Oh! would to God I may be\r\nenabled to feel enough sustained by an occasional, amicable intercourse, rare,\r\nbrief, unengrossing and tranquil: quite tranquil!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill repeating this word, I turned to my pillow; and still repeating\r\nit, I steeped that pillow with tears.\r\n\n"}
{"18": "\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nLA TERRASSE.\n\r\nThese struggles with the natural character, the strong native bent of the\r\nheart, may seem futile and fruitless, but in the end they do good. They tend,\r\nhowever slightly, to give the actions, the conduct, that turn which Reason\r\napproves, and which Feeling, perhaps, too often opposes: they certainly make a\r\ndifference in the general tenour of a life, and enable it to be better\r\nregulated, more equable, quieter on the surface; and it is on the surface only\r\nthe common gaze will fall. As to what lies below, leave that with God. Man,\r\nyour equal, weak as you, and not fit to be your judge, may be shut out thence:\r\ntake it to your Maker\u2014show Him the secrets of the spirit He gave\u2014ask Him how\r\nyou are to bear the pains He has appointed\u2014kneel in His presence, and pray with\r\nfaith for light in darkness, for strength in piteous weakness, for patience in\r\nextreme need. Certainly, at some hour, though perhaps not your hour, the\r\nwaiting waters will stir; in some shape, though perhaps not the shape\r\nyou dreamed, which your heart loved, and for which it bled, the healing herald\r\nwill descend, the cripple and the blind, and the dumb, and the possessed will\r\nbe led to bathe. Herald, come quickly! Thousands lie round the pool, weeping\r\nand despairing, to see it, through slow years, stagnant. Long are the \u201ctimes\u201d\r\nof Heaven: the orbits of angel messengers seem wide to mortal vision; they may\r\nenring ages: the cycle of one departure and return may clasp unnumbered\r\ngenerations; and dust, kindling to brief suffering life, and through pain,\r\npassing back to dust, may meanwhile perish out of memory again, and yet again.\r\nTo how many maimed and mourning millions is the first and sole angel visitant,\r\nhim easterns call Azrael!\r\n\n\r\nI tried to get up next morning, but while I was dressing, and at intervals\r\ndrinking cold water from the carafe on my washstand, with design to\r\nbrace up that trembling weakness which made dressing so difficult, in came Mrs.\r\nBretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere is an absurdity!\u201d was her morning accost. \u201cNot so,\u201d she added, and\r\ndealing with me at once in her own brusque, energetic fashion\u2014that fashion\r\nwhich I used formerly to enjoy seeing applied to her son, and by him vigorously\r\nresisted\u2014in two minutes she consigned me captive to the French bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere you lie till afternoon,\u201d said she. \u201cMy boy left orders before he went\r\nout that such should be the case, and I can assure you my son is master and\r\nmust be obeyed. Presently you shall have breakfast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPresently she brought that meal\u2014brought it with her own active hands\u2014not\r\nleaving me to servants. She seated herself on the bed while I ate. Now it is\r\nnot everybody, even amongst our respected friends and esteemed acquaintance,\r\nwhom we like to have near us, whom we like to watch us, to wait on us, to\r\napproach us with the proximity of a nurse to a patient. It is not every friend\r\nwhose eye is a light in a sick room, whose presence is there a solace: but all\r\nthis was Mrs. Bretton to me; all this she had ever been. Food or drink never\r\npleased me so well as when it came through her hands. I do not remember the\r\noccasion when her entrance into a room had not made that room cheerier. Our\r\nnatures own predilections and antipathies alike strange. There are people from\r\nwhom we secretly shrink, whom we would personally avoid, though reason\r\nconfesses that they are good people: there are others with faults of temper,\r\n&c., evident enough, beside whom we live content, as if the air about them\r\ndid us good. My godmother\u2019s lively black eye and clear brunette cheek, her\r\nwarm, prompt hand, her self-reliant mood, her decided bearing, were all\r\nbeneficial to me as the atmosphere of some salubrious climate. Her son used to\r\ncall her \u201cthe old lady;\u201d it filled me with pleasant wonder to note how the\r\nalacrity and power of five-and-twenty still breathed from her and around her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would bring my work here,\u201d she said, as she took from me the emptied teacup,\r\n\u201cand sit with you the whole day, if that overbearing John Graham had not put\r\nhis veto upon such a proceeding. \u2018Now, mamma,\u2019 he said, when he went out, \u2018take\r\nnotice, you are not to knock up your god-daughter with gossip,\u2019 and he\r\nparticularly desired me to keep close to my own quarters, and spare you my fine\r\ncompany. He says, Lucy, he thinks you have had a nervous fever, judging from\r\nyour look,\u2014is that so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I did not quite know what my ailment had been, but that I had\r\ncertainly suffered a good deal especially in mind. Further, on this subject, I\r\ndid not consider it advisable to dwell, for the details of what I had undergone\r\nbelonged to a portion of my existence in which I never expected my godmother to\r\ntake a share. Into what a new region would such a confidence have led that\r\nhale, serene nature! The difference between her and me might be figured by that\r\nbetween the stately ship cruising safe on smooth seas, with its full complement\r\nof crew, a captain gay and brave, and venturous and provident; and the\r\nlife-boat, which most days of the year lies dry and solitary in an old, dark\r\nboat-house, only putting to sea when the billows run high in rough weather,\r\nwhen cloud encounters water, when danger and death divide between them the rule\r\nof the great deep. No, the \u201cLouisa Bretton\u201d never was out of harbour on such a\r\nnight, and in such a scene: her crew could not conceive it; so the half-drowned\r\nlife-boat man keeps his own counsel, and spins no yarns.\r\n\n\r\nShe left me, and I lay in bed content: it was good of Graham to remember me\r\nbefore he went out.\r\n\n\r\nMy day was lonely, but the prospect of coming evening abridged and cheered it.\r\nThen, too, I felt weak, and rest seemed welcome; and after the morning hours\r\nwere gone by,\u2014those hours which always bring, even to the necessarily\r\nunoccupied, a sense of business to be done, of tasks waiting fulfilment, a\r\nvague impression of obligation to be employed\u2014when this stirring time was past,\r\nand the silent descent of afternoon hushed housemaid steps on the stairs and in\r\nthe chambers, I then passed into a dreamy mood, not unpleasant.\r\n\n\r\nMy calm little room seemed somehow like a cave in the sea. There was no colour\r\nabout it, except that white and pale green, suggestive of foam and deep water;\r\nthe blanched cornice was adorned with shell-shaped ornaments, and there were\r\nwhite mouldings like dolphins in the ceiling-angles. Even that one touch of\r\ncolour visible in the red satin pincushion bore affinity to coral; even that\r\ndark, shining glass might have mirrored a mermaid. When I closed my eyes, I\r\nheard a gale, subsiding at last, bearing upon the house-front like a settling\r\nswell upon a rock-base. I heard it drawn and withdrawn far, far off, like a\r\ntide retiring from a shore of the upper world\u2014a world so high above that the\r\nrush of its largest waves, the dash of its fiercest breakers, could sound down\r\nin this submarine home, only like murmurs and a lullaby.\r\n\n\r\nAmidst these dreams came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with her aid\r\nI was quickly dressed, and stronger now than in the morning, I made my way down\r\nto the blue saloon unassisted.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John, it appears, had concluded his round of professional calls earlier\r\nthan usual; his form was the first object that met my eyes as I entered the\r\nparlour; he stood in that window-recess opposite the door, reading the close\r\ntype of a newspaper by such dull light as closing day yet gave. The fire shone\r\nclear, but the lamp stood on the table unlit, and tea was not yet brought up.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Mrs. Bretton, my active godmother\u2014who, I afterwards found, had been out\r\nin the open air all day\u2014lay half-reclined in her deep-cushioned chair, actually\r\nlost in a nap. Her son seeing me, came forward. I noticed that he trod\r\ncarefully, not to wake the sleeper; he also spoke low: his mellow voice never\r\nhad any sharpness in it; modulated as at present, it was calculated rather to\r\nsoothe than startle slumber.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is a quiet little ch\u00e2teau,\u201d he observed, after inviting me to sit near\r\nthe casement. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you may have noticed it in your walks:\r\nthough, indeed, from the chauss\u00e9e it is not visible; just a mile beyond the\r\nPorte de Cr\u00e9cy, you turn down a lane which soon becomes an avenue, and that\r\nleads you on, through meadow and shade, to the very door of this house. It is\r\nnot a modern place, but built somewhat in the old style of the Basse-Ville. It\r\nis rather a manoir than a ch\u00e2teau; they call it \u2018La Terrasse,\u2019 because its\r\nfront rises from a broad turfed walk, whence steps lead down a grassy slope to\r\nthe avenue. See yonder! The moon rises: she looks well through the tree-boles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhere, indeed, does the moon not look well? What is the scene, confined or\r\nexpansive, which her orb does not hallow? Rosy or fiery, she mounted now above\r\na not distant bank; even while we watched her flushed ascent, she cleared to\r\ngold, and in very brief space, floated up stainless into a now calm sky. Did\r\nmoonlight soften or sadden Dr. Bretton? Did it touch him with romance? I think\r\nit did. Albeit of no sighing mood, he sighed in watching it: sighed to himself\r\nquietly. No need to ponder the cause or the course of that sigh; I knew it was\r\nwakened by beauty; I knew it pursued Ginevra. Knowing this, the idea pressed\r\nupon me that it was in some sort my duty to speak the name he meditated. Of\r\ncourse he was ready for the subject: I saw in his countenance a teeming\r\nplenitude of comment, question and interest; a pressure of language and\r\nsentiment, only checked, I thought, by sense of embarrassment how to begin. To\r\nspare him this embarrassment was my best, indeed my sole use. I had but to\r\nutter the idol\u2019s name, and love\u2019s tender litany would flow out. I had just\r\nfound a fitting phrase, \u201cYou know that Miss Fanshawe is gone on a tour with the\r\nCholmondeleys,\u201d and was opening my lips to speak to it, when he scattered my\r\nplans by introducing another theme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing this morning,\u201d said he, putting his sentiment in his pocket,\r\nturning from the moon, and sitting down, \u201cI went to the Rue Fossette, and told\r\nthe cuisini\u00e8re that you were safe and in good hands. Do you know that I\r\nactually found that she had not yet discovered your absence from the house: she\r\nthought you safe in the great dormitory. With what care you must have been\r\nwaited on!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! all that is very conceivable,\u201d said I. \u201cGoton could do nothing for me but\r\nbring me a little tisane and a crust of bread, and I had rejected both so often\r\nduring the past week, that the good woman got tired of useless journeys from\r\nthe dwelling-house kitchen to the school-dormitory, and only came once a day at\r\nnoon to make my bed. I believe, however, that she is a good-natured creature,\r\nand would have been delighted to cook me c\u00f4telettes de mouton, if I could have\r\neaten them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did Madame Beck mean by leaving you alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame Beck could not foresee that I should fall ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour nervous system bore a good share of the suffering?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not quite sure what my nervous system is, but I was dreadfully\r\nlow-spirited.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich disables me from helping you by pill or potion. Medicine can give nobody\r\ngood spirits. My art halts at the threshold of Hypochondria: she just looks in\r\nand sees a chamber of torture, but can neither say nor do much. Cheerful\r\nsociety would be of use; you should be as little alone as possible; you should\r\ntake plenty of exercise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAcquiescence and a pause followed these remarks. They sounded all right, I\r\nthought, and bore the safe sanction of custom, and the well-worn stamp of use.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d recommenced Dr. John\u2014my health, nervous system included, being\r\nnow, somewhat to my relief, discussed and done with\u2014\u201cis it permitted me to ask\r\nwhat your religion is? Are you a Catholic?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked up in some surprise\u2014\u201cA Catholic? No! Why suggest such an idea?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe manner in which you were consigned to me last night made me doubt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI consigned to you? But, indeed, I forget. It yet remains for me to learn how\r\nI fell into your hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, under circumstances that puzzled me. I had been in attendance all day\r\nyesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical character; the\r\ndisease being rare, and its treatment doubtful: I saw a similar and still finer\r\ncase in a hospital in Paris; but that will not interest you. At last a\r\nmitigation of the patient\u2019s most urgent symptoms (acute pain is one of its\r\naccompaniments) liberated me, and I set out homeward. My shortest way lay\r\nthrough the Basse-Ville, and as the night was excessively dark, wild, and wet,\r\nI took it. In riding past an old church belonging to a community of B\u00e9guines, I\r\nsaw by a lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance, a priest\r\nlifting some object in his arms. The lamp was bright enough to reveal the\r\npriest\u2019s features clearly, and I recognised him; he was a man I have often met\r\nby the sick beds of both rich and poor: and chiefly the latter. He is, I think,\r\na good old man, far better than most of his class in this country; superior,\r\nindeed, in every way, better informed, as well as more devoted to duty. Our\r\neyes met; he called on me to stop: what he supported was a woman, fainting or\r\ndying. I alighted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This person is one of your countrywomen,\u2019 he said: \u2018save her, if she is not\r\ndead.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy countrywoman, on examination, turned out to be the English teacher at\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s pensionnat. She was perfectly unconscious, perfectly bloodless,\r\nand nearly cold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What does it all mean?\u2019 was my inquiry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe communicated a curious account; that you had been to him that evening at\r\nconfessional; that your exhausted and suffering appearance, coupled with some\r\nthings you had said\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThings I had said? I wonder what things!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAwful crimes, no doubt; but he did not tell me what: there, you know, the seal\r\nof the confessional checked his garrulity, and my curiosity. Your confidences,\r\nhowever, had not made an enemy of the good father; it seems he was so struck,\r\nand felt so sorry that you should be out on such a night alone, that he had\r\nesteemed it a Christian duty to watch you when you quitted the church, and so\r\nto manage as not to lose sight of you, till you should have reached home.\r\nPerhaps the worthy man might, half unconsciously, have blent in this proceeding\r\nsome little of the subtlety of his class: it might have been his resolve to\r\nlearn the locality of your home\u2014did you impart that in your confession?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not: on the contrary, I carefully avoided the shadow of any indication:\r\nand as to my confession, Dr. John, I suppose you will think me mad for taking\r\nsuch a step, but I could not help it: I suppose it was all the fault of what\r\nyou call my \u2018nervous system.\u2019 I cannot put the case into words, but my days and\r\nnights were grown intolerable: a cruel sense of desolation pained my mind: a\r\nfeeling that would make its way, rush out, or kill me\u2014like (and this you will\r\nunderstand, Dr. John) the current which passes through the heart, and which, if\r\naneurism or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels, seeks\r\nabnormal outlet. I wanted companionship, I wanted friendship, I wanted counsel.\r\nI could find none of these in closet or chamber, so I went and sought them in\r\nchurch and confessional. As to what I said, it was no confidence, no narrative.\r\nI have done nothing wrong: my life has not been active enough for any dark\r\ndeed, either of romance or reality: all I poured out was a dreary, desperate\r\ncomplaint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, you ought to travel for about six months: why, your calm nature is\r\ngrowing quite excitable! Confound Madame Beck! Has the little buxom widow no\r\nbowels, to condemn her best teacher to solitary confinement?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not Madame Beck\u2019s fault,\u201d said I; \u201cit is no living being\u2019s fault, and I\r\nwon\u2019t hear any one blamed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is in the wrong, then, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMe\u2014Dr. John\u2014me; and a great abstraction on whose wide shoulders I like to lay\r\nthe mountains of blame they were sculptured to bear: me and Fate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Me\u2019 must take better care in future,\u201d said Dr. John\u2014smiling, I suppose, at my\r\nbad grammar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChange of air\u2014change of scene; those are my prescriptions,\u201d pursued the\r\npractical young doctor. \u201cBut to return to our muttons, Lucy. As yet, P\u00e8re\r\nSilas, with all his tact (they say he is a Jesuit), is no wiser than you choose\r\nhim to be; for, instead of returning to the Rue Fossette, your fevered\r\nwanderings\u2014there must have been high fever\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Dr. John: the fever took its turn that night\u2014now, don\u2019t make out that I\r\nwas delirious, for I know differently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood! you were as collected as myself at this moment, no doubt. Your\r\nwanderings had taken an opposite direction to the pensionnat. Near the\r\nB\u00e9guinage, amidst the stress of flood and gust, and in the perplexity of\r\ndarkness, you had swooned and fallen. The priest came to your succour, and the\r\nphysician, as we have seen, supervened. Between us we procured a fiacre and\r\nbrought you here. P\u00e8re Silas, old as he is, would carry you up-stairs, and lay\r\nyou on that couch himself. He would certainly have remained with you till\r\nsuspended animation had been restored: and so should I, but, at that juncture,\r\na hurried messenger arrived from the dying patient I had scarcely left\u2014the last\r\nduties were called for\u2014the physician\u2019s last visit and the priest\u2019s last rite;\r\nextreme unction could not be deferred. P\u00e8re Silas and myself departed together,\r\nmy mother was spending the evening abroad; we gave you in charge to Martha,\r\nleaving directions, which it seems she followed successfully. Now, are you a\r\nCatholic?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said I, with a smile. \u201cAnd never let P\u00e8re Silas know where I live,\r\nor he will try to convert me; but give him my best and truest thanks when you\r\nsee him, and if ever I get rich I will send him money for his charities. See,\r\nDr. John, your mother wakes; you ought to ring for tea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich he did; and, as Mrs. Bretton sat up\u2014astonished and indignant at herself\r\nfor the indulgence to which she had succumbed, and fully prepared to deny that\r\nshe had slept at all\u2014her son came gaily to the attack.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHushaby, mamma! Sleep again. You look the picture of innocence in your\r\nslumbers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy slumbers, John Graham! What are you talking about? You know I never\r\ndo sleep by day: it was the slightest doze possible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExactly! a seraph\u2019s gentle lapse\u2014a fairy\u2019s dream. Mamma, under such\r\ncircumstances, you always remind me of Titania.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is because you, yourself, are so like Bottom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe\u2014did you ever hear anything like mamma\u2019s wit? She is a most\r\nsprightly woman of her size and age.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep your compliments to yourself, sir, and do not neglect your own size:\r\nwhich seems to me a good deal on the increase. Lucy, has he not rather the air\r\nof an incipient John Bull? He used to be slender as an eel, and now I fancy in\r\nhim a sort of heavy dragoon bent\u2014a beef-eater tendency. Graham, take notice! If\r\nyou grow fat I disown you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if you could not sooner disown your own personality! I am indispensable to\r\nthe old lady\u2019s happiness, Lucy. She would pine away in green and yellow\r\nmelancholy if she had not my six feet of iniquity to scold. It keeps her\r\nlively\u2014it maintains the wholesome ferment of her spirits.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe two were now standing opposite to each other, one on each side the\r\nfire-place; their words were not very fond, but their mutual looks atoned for\r\nverbal deficiencies. At least, the best treasure of Mrs. Bretton\u2019s life was\r\ncertainly casketed in her son\u2019s bosom; her dearest pulse throbbed in his heart.\r\nAs to him, of course another love shared his feelings with filial love, and, no\r\ndoubt, as the new passion was the latest born, so he assigned it in his\r\nemotions Benjamin\u2019s portion. Ginevra! Ginevra! Did Mrs. Bretton yet know at\r\nwhose feet her own young idol had laid his homage? Would she approve that\r\nchoice? I could not tell; but I could well guess that if she knew Miss\r\nFanshawe\u2019s conduct towards Graham: her alternations between coldness and\r\ncoaxing, and repulse and allurement; if she could at all suspect the pain with\r\nwhich she had tried him; if she could have seen, as I had seen, his fine\r\nspirits subdued and harassed, his inferior preferred before him, his\r\nsubordinate made the instrument of his humiliation\u2014then Mrs. Bretton\r\nwould have pronounced Ginevra imbecile, or perverted, or both. Well\u2014I thought\r\nso too.\r\n\n\r\nThat second evening passed as sweetly as the first\u2014more sweetly indeed:\r\nwe enjoyed a smoother interchange of thought; old troubles were not reverted\r\nto, acquaintance was better cemented; I felt happier, easier, more at home.\r\nThat night\u2014instead of crying myself asleep\u2014I went down to dreamland by a\r\npathway bordered with pleasant thoughts.\r\n\n"}
{"19": "\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nWE QUARREL.\n\r\nDuring the first days of my stay at the Terrace, Graham never took a seat near\r\nme, or in his frequent pacing of the room approached the quarter where I sat,\r\nor looked pre-occupied, or more grave than usual, but I thought of Miss\r\nFanshawe and expected her name to leap from his lips. I kept my ear and mind in\r\nperpetual readiness for the tender theme; my patience was ordered to be\r\npermanently under arms, and my sympathy desired to keep its cornucopia\r\nreplenished and ready for outpouring. At last, and after a little inward\r\nstruggle, which I saw and respected, he one day launched into the topic. It was\r\nintroduced delicately; anonymously as it were.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour friend is spending her vacation in travelling, I hear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFriend, forsooth!\u201d thought I to myself: but it would not do to contradict; he\r\nmust have his own way; I must own the soft impeachment: friend let it be.\r\nStill, by way of experiment, I could not help asking whom he meant?\r\n\n\r\nHe had taken a seat at my work-table; he now laid hands on a reel of thread\r\nwhich he proceeded recklessly to unwind.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra\u2014Miss Fanshawe, has accompanied the Cholmondeleys on a tour through the\r\nsouth of France?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you and she correspond?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will astonish you to hear that I never once thought of making application\r\nfor that privilege.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have seen letters of her writing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; several to her uncle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey will not be deficient in wit and na\u00efvet\u00e9; there is so much\r\nsparkle, and so little art in her soul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe writes comprehensively enough when she writes to M. de Bassompierre: he\r\nwho runs may read.\u201d (In fact, Ginevra\u2019s epistles to her wealthy kinsman were\r\ncommonly business documents, unequivocal applications for cash.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd her handwriting? It must be pretty, light, ladylike, I should think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was, and I said so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI verily believe that all she does is well done,\u201d said Dr. John; and as I\r\nseemed in no hurry to chime in with this remark, he added \u201cYou, who know her,\r\ncould you name a point in which she is deficient?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe does several things very well.\u201d (\u201cFlirtation amongst the rest,\u201d subjoined\r\nI, in thought.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen do you suppose she will return to town?\u201d he soon inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, Dr. John, I must explain. You honour me too much in ascribing to me\r\na degree of intimacy with Miss Fanshawe I have not the felicity to enjoy. I\r\nhave never been the depositary of her plans and secrets. You will find her\r\nparticular friends in another sphere than mine: amongst the Cholmondeleys, for\r\ninstance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe actually thought I was stung with a kind of jealous pain similar to his own!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse her,\u201d he said; \u201cjudge her indulgently; the glitter of fashion misleads\r\nher, but she will soon find out that these people are hollow, and will return\r\nto you with augmented attachment and confirmed trust. I know something of the\r\nCholmondeleys: superficial, showy, selfish people; depend on it, at heart\r\nGinevra values you beyond a score of such.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind,\u201d I said briefly.\r\n\n\r\nA disclaimer of the sentiments attributed to me burned on my lips, but I\r\nextinguished the flame. I submitted to be looked upon as the humiliated,\r\ncast-off, and now pining confidante of the distinguished Miss Fanshawe: but,\r\nreader, it was a hard submission.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet, you see,\u201d continued Graham, \u201cwhile I comfort you, I cannot take\r\nthe same consolation to myself; I cannot hope she will do me justice. De Hamal\r\nis most worthless, yet I fear he pleases her: wretched delusion!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy patience really gave way, and without notice: all at once. I suppose illness\r\nand weakness had worn it and made it brittle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton,\u201d I broke out, \u201cthere is no delusion like your own. On all points\r\nbut one you are a man, frank, healthful, right-thinking, clear-sighted: on this\r\nexceptional point you are but a slave. I declare, where Miss Fanshawe is\r\nconcerned, you merit no respect; nor have you mine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI got up, and left the room very much excited.\r\n\n\r\nThis little scene took place in the morning; I had to meet him again in the\r\nevening, and then I saw I had done mischief. He was not made of common clay,\r\nnot put together out of vulgar materials; while the outlines of his nature had\r\nbeen shaped with breadth and vigour, the details embraced workmanship of almost\r\nfeminine delicacy: finer, much finer, than you could be prepared to meet with;\r\nthan you could believe inherent in him, even after years of acquaintance.\r\nIndeed, till some over-sharp contact with his nerves had betrayed, by its\r\neffects, their acute sensibility, this elaborate construction must be ignored;\r\nand the more especially because the sympathetic faculty was not prominent in\r\nhim: to feel, and to seize quickly another\u2019s feelings, are separate properties;\r\na few constructions possess both, some neither. Dr. John had the one in\r\nexquisite perfection; and because I have admitted that he was not endowed with\r\nthe other in equal degree, the reader will considerately refrain from passing\r\nto an extreme, and pronouncing him _un_sympathizing, unfeeling: on the\r\ncontrary, he was a kind, generous man. Make your need known, his hand was open.\r\nPut your grief into words, he turned no deaf ear. Expect refinements of\r\nperception, miracles of intuition, and realize disappointment. This night, when\r\nDr. John entered the room, and met the evening lamp, I saw well and at one\r\nglance his whole mechanism.\r\n\n\r\nTo one who had named him \u201cslave,\u201d and, on any point, banned him from respect,\r\nhe must now have peculiar feelings. That the epithet was well applied, and the\r\nban just, might be; he put forth no denial that it was so: his mind even\r\ncandidly revolved that unmanning possibility. He sought in this accusation the\r\ncause of that ill-success which had got so galling a hold on his mental peace:\r\nAmid the worry of a self-condemnatory soliloquy, his demeanour seemed grave,\r\nperhaps cold, both to me and his mother. And yet there was no bad feeling, no\r\nmalice, no rancour, no littleness in his countenance, beautiful with a man\u2019s\r\nbest beauty, even in its depression. When I placed his chair at the table,\r\nwhich I hastened to do, anticipating the servant, and when I handed him his\r\ntea, which I did with trembling care, he said: \u201cThank you, Lucy,\u201d in as kindly\r\na tone of his full pleasant voice as ever my ear welcomed.\r\n\n\r\nFor my part, there was only one plan to be pursued; I must expiate my culpable\r\nvehemence, or I must not sleep that night. This would not do at all; I could\r\nnot stand it: I made no pretence of capacity to wage war on this footing.\r\nSchool solitude, conventual silence and stagnation, anything seemed preferable\r\nto living embroiled with Dr. John. As to Ginevra, she might take the silver\r\nwings of a dove, or any other fowl that flies, and mount straight up to the\r\nhighest place, among the highest stars, where her lover\u2019s highest flight of\r\nfancy chose to fix the constellation of her charms: never more be it mine to\r\ndispute the arrangement. Long I tried to catch his eye. Again and again that\r\neye just met mine; but, having nothing to say, it withdrew, and I was baffled.\r\nAfter tea, he sat, sad and quiet, reading a book. I wished I could have dared\r\nto go and sit near him, but it seemed that if I ventured to take that step, he\r\nwould infallibly evince hostility and indignation. I longed to speak out, and I\r\ndared not whisper. His mother left the room; then, moved by insupportable\r\nregret, I just murmured the words \u201cDr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked up from his book; his eyes were not cold or malevolent, his mouth was\r\nnot cynical; he was ready and willing to hear what I might have to say: his\r\nspirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunder-clap.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton, forgive my hasty words: do, do forgive them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe smiled that moment I spoke. \u201cPerhaps I deserved them, Lucy. If you don\u2019t\r\nrespect me, I am sure it is because I am not respectable. I fear, I am an\r\nawkward fool: I must manage badly in some way, for where I wish to please, it\r\nseems I don\u2019t please.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf that you cannot be sure; and even if such be the case, is it the fault of\r\nyour character, or of another\u2019s perceptions? But now, let me unsay what I said\r\nin anger. In one thing, and in all things, I deeply respect you. If you think\r\nscarcely enough of yourself, and too much of others, what is that but an\r\nexcellence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I think too much of Ginevra?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you may; you believe you can\u2019t. Let us agree to\r\ndiffer. Let me be pardoned; that is what I ask.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you think I cherish ill-will for one warm word?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see you do not and cannot; but just say, \u2018Lucy, I forgive you!\u2019 Say that, to\r\nease me of the heart-ache.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut away your heart-ache, as I will put away mine; for you wounded me a\r\nlittle, Lucy. Now, when the pain is gone, I more than forgive: I feel grateful,\r\nas to a sincere well-wisher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am your sincere well-wisher: you are right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus our quarrel ended.\r\n\n\r\nReader, if in the course of this work, you find that my opinion of Dr. John\r\nundergoes modification, excuse the seeming inconsistency. I give the feeling as\r\nat the time I felt it; I describe the view of character as it appeared when\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\n\r\nHe showed the fineness of his nature by being kinder to me after that\r\nmisunderstanding than before. Nay, the very incident which, by my theory, must\r\nin some degree estrange me and him, changed, indeed, somewhat our relations;\r\nbut not in the sense I painfully anticipated. An invisible, but a cold\r\nsomething, very slight, very transparent, but very chill: a sort of screen of\r\nice had hitherto, all through our two lives, glazed the medium through which we\r\nexchanged intercourse. Those few warm words, though only warm with anger,\r\nbreathed on that frail frost-work of reserve; about this time, it gave note of\r\ndissolution. I think from that day, so long as we continued friends, he never\r\nin discourse stood on topics of ceremony with me. He seemed to know that if he\r\nwould but talk about himself, and about that in which he was most interested,\r\nmy expectation would always be answered, my wish always satisfied. It follows,\r\nas a matter of course, that I continued to hear much of \u201cGinevra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra!\u201d He thought her so fair, so good; he spoke so lovingly of her charms,\r\nher sweetness, her innocence, that, in spite of my plain prose knowledge of the\r\nreality, a kind of reflected glow began to settle on her idea, even for me.\r\nStill, reader, I am free to confess, that he often talked nonsense; but I\r\nstrove to be unfailingly patient with him. I had had my lesson: I had learned\r\nhow severe for me was the pain of crossing, or grieving, or disappointing him.\r\nIn a strange and new sense, I grew most selfish, and quite powerless to deny\r\nmyself the delight of indulging his mood, and being pliant to his will. He\r\nstill seemed to me most absurd when he obstinately doubted, and desponded about\r\nhis power to win in the end Miss Fanshawe\u2019s preference. The fancy became rooted\r\nin my own mind more stubbornly than ever, that she was only coquetting to goad\r\nhim, and that, at heart, she coveted every one of his words and looks.\r\nSometimes he harassed me, in spite of my resolution to bear and hear; in the\r\nmidst of the indescribable gall-honey pleasure of thus bearing and hearing, he\r\nstruck so on the flint of what firmness I owned, that it emitted fire once and\r\nagain. I chanced to assert one day, with a view to stilling his impatience,\r\nthat in my own mind, I felt positive Miss Fanshawe must intend\r\neventually to accept him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPositive! It was easy to say so, but had I any grounds for such assurance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe best grounds.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Lucy, do tell me what!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know them as well as I; and, knowing them, Dr. John, it really amazes me\r\nthat you should not repose the frankest confidence in her fidelity. To doubt,\r\nunder the circumstances, is almost to insult.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow you are beginning to speak fast and to breathe short; but speak a little\r\nfaster and breathe a little shorter, till you have given an explanation\u2014a full\r\nexplanation: I must have it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall, Dr. John. In some cases, you are a lavish, generous man: you are a\r\nworshipper ever ready with the votive offering should P\u00e8re Silas ever convert\r\nyou, you will give him abundance of alms for his poor, you will supply\r\nhis altar with tapers, and the shrine of your favourite saint you will do your\r\nbest to enrich: Ginevra, Dr. John\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said he, \u201cdon\u2019t go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush, I will not: and go on I will: Ginevra has had her hands\r\nfilled from your hands more times than I can count. You have sought for her the\r\ncostliest flowers; you have busied your brain in devising gifts the most\r\ndelicate: such, one would have thought, as only a woman could have imagined;\r\nand in addition, Miss Fanshawe owns a set of ornaments, to purchase which your\r\ngenerosity must have verged on extravagance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe modesty Ginevra herself had never evinced in this matter, now flushed all\r\nover the face of her admirer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d he said, destructively snipping a skein of silk with my scissors.\r\n\u201cI offered them to please myself: I felt she did me a favour in accepting\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe did more than a favour, Dr. John: she pledged her very honour that she\r\nwould make you some return; and if she cannot pay you in affection, she ought\r\nto hand out a business-like equivalent, in the shape of some rouleaux of gold\r\npieces.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand her; she is far too disinterested to care for my\r\ngifts, and too simple-minded to know their value.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed out: I had heard her adjudge to every jewel its price; and well I\r\nknew money-embarrassment, money-schemes; money\u2019s worth, and endeavours to\r\nrealise supplies, had, young as she was, furnished the most frequent, and the\r\nfavourite stimulus of her thoughts for years.\r\n\n\r\nHe pursued. \u201cYou should have seen her whenever I have laid on her lap some\r\ntrifle; so cool, so unmoved: no eagerness to take, not even pleasure in\r\ncontemplating. Just from amiable reluctance to grieve me, she would permit the\r\nbouquet to lie beside her, and perhaps consent to bear it away. Or, if I\r\nachieved the fastening of a bracelet on her ivory arm, however pretty the\r\ntrinket might be (and I always carefully chose what seemed to me pretty,\r\nand what of course was not valueless), the glitter never dazzled her bright\r\neyes: she would hardly cast one look on my gift.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, of course, not valuing it, she would unloose, and return it to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; for such a repulse she was too good-natured. She would consent to seem to\r\nforget what I had done, and retain the offering with lady-like quiet and easy\r\noblivion. Under such circumstances, how can a man build on acceptance of his\r\npresents as a favourable symptom? For my part, were I to offer her all I have,\r\nand she to take it, such is her incapacity to be swayed by sordid\r\nconsiderations, I should not venture to believe the transaction advanced me one\r\nstep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John,\u201d I began, \u201cLove is blind;\u201d but just then a blue subtle ray sped\r\nsideways from Dr. John\u2019s eye: it reminded me of old days, it reminded me of his\r\npicture: it half led me to think that part, at least, of his professed\r\npersuasion of Miss Fanshawe\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 was assumed; it led me dubiously\r\nto conjecture that perhaps, in spite of his passion for her beauty, his\r\nappreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken, more\r\nclear-sighted, than from his general language was presumable. After all it\r\nmight be only a chance look, or at best the token of a merely momentary\r\nimpression. Chance or intentional real or imaginary, it closed the\r\nconversation.\r\n\n"}
{"20": "\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE CLEOPATRA.\n\r\nMy stay at La Terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of the\r\nvacation. Mrs. Bretton\u2019s kind management procured me this respite. Her son\r\nhaving one day delivered the dictum that \u201cLucy was not yet strong enough to go\r\nback to that den of a pensionnat,\u201d she at once drove over to the Rue Fossette,\r\nhad an interview with the directress, and procured the indulgence, on the plea\r\nof prolonged rest and change being necessary to perfect recovery. Hereupon,\r\nhowever, followed an attention I could very well have dispensed with, viz.\u2014a\r\npolite call from Madame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nThat lady\u2014one fine day\u2014actually came out in a fiacre as far as the ch\u00e2teau. I\r\nsuppose she had resolved within herself to see what manner of place Dr. John\r\ninhabited. Apparently, the pleasant site and neat interior surpassed her\r\nexpectations; she eulogized all she saw, pronounced the blue salon \u201cune pi\u00e8ce\r\nmagnifique,\u201d profusely congratulated me on the acquisition of friends,\r\n\u201ctellement dignes, aimables, et respectables,\u201d turned also a neat compliment in\r\nmy favour, and, upon Dr. John coming in, ran up to him with the utmost\r\nbuoyancy, opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language, all sparkling\r\nwith felicitations and protestations about his \u201cch\u00e2teau,\u201d\u2014\u201cmadame sa m\u00e8re, la\r\ndigne ch\u00e2telaine:\u201d also his looks; which, indeed, were very flourishing, and at\r\nthe moment additionally embellished by the good-natured but amused smile with\r\nwhich he always listened to Madame\u2019s fluent and florid French. In short, Madame\r\nshone in her very best phase that day, and came in and went out quite a living\r\ncatherine-wheel of compliments, delight, and affability. Half purposely, and\r\nhalf to ask some question about school-business, I followed her to the\r\ncarriage, and looked in after she was seated and the door closed. In that brief\r\nfraction of time what a change had been wrought! An instant ago, all sparkles\r\nand jests, she now sat sterner than a judge and graver than a sage. Strange\r\nlittle woman!\r\n\n\r\nI went back and teased Dr. John about Madame\u2019s devotion to him. How he laughed!\r\nWhat fun shone in his eyes as he recalled some of her fine speeches, and\r\nrepeated them, imitating her voluble delivery! He had an acute sense of humour,\r\nand was the finest company in the world\u2014when he could forget Miss Fanshawe.\r\n\n\r\nTo \u201csit in sunshine calm and sweet\u201d is said to be excellent for weak people; it\r\ngives them vital force. When little Georgette Beck was recovering from her\r\nillness, I used to take her in my arms and walk with her in the garden by the\r\nhour together, beneath a certain wall hung with grapes, which the Southern sun\r\nwas ripening: that sun cherished her little pale frame quite as effectually as\r\nit mellowed and swelled the clustering fruit.\r\n\n\r\nThere are human tempers, bland, glowing, and genial, within whose influence it\r\nis as good for the poor in spirit to live, as it is for the feeble in frame to\r\nbask in the glow of noon. Of the number of these choice natures were certainly\r\nboth Dr. Bretton\u2019s and his mother\u2019s. They liked to communicate happiness, as\r\nsome like to occasion misery: they did it instinctively; without fuss, and\r\napparently with little consciousness; the means to give pleasure rose\r\nspontaneously in their minds. Every day while I stayed with them, some little\r\nplan was proposed which resulted in beneficial enjoyment. Fully occupied as was\r\nDr. John\u2019s time, he still made it in his way to accompany us in each brief\r\nexcursion. I can hardly tell how he managed his engagements; they were\r\nnumerous, yet by dint of system, he classed them in an order which left him a\r\ndaily period of liberty. I often saw him hard-worked, yet seldom over-driven,\r\nand never irritated, confused, or oppressed. What he did was accomplished with\r\nthe ease and grace of all-sufficing strength; with the bountiful cheerfulness\r\nof high and unbroken energies. Under his guidance I saw, in that one happy\r\nfortnight, more of Villette, its environs, and its inhabitants, than I had seen\r\nin the whole eight months of my previous residence. He took me to places of\r\ninterest in the town, of whose names I had not before so much as heard; with\r\nwillingness and spirit he communicated much noteworthy information. He never\r\nseemed to think it a trouble to talk to me, and, I am sure, it was never a task\r\nto me to listen. It was not his way to treat subjects coldly and vaguely; he\r\nrarely generalized, never prosed. He seemed to like nice details almost as much\r\nas I liked them myself: he seemed observant of character: and not superficially\r\nobservant, either. These points gave the quality of interest to his discourse;\r\nand the fact of his speaking direct from his own resources, and not borrowing\r\nor stealing from books\u2014here a dry fact, and there a trite phrase, and elsewhere\r\na hackneyed opinion\u2014ensured a freshness, as welcome as it was rare. Before my\r\neyes, too, his disposition seemed to unfold another phase; to pass to a fresh\r\nday: to rise in new and nobler dawn.\r\n\n\r\nHis mother possessed a good development of benevolence, but he owned a better\r\nand larger. I found, on accompanying him to the Basse-Ville\u2014the poor and\r\ncrowded quarter of the city\u2014that his errands there were as much those of the\r\nphilanthropist as the physician. I understood presently that cheerfully,\r\nhabitually, and in single-minded unconsciousness of any special merit\r\ndistinguishing his deeds\u2014he was achieving, amongst a very wretched population,\r\na world of active good. The lower orders liked him well; his poor patients in\r\nthe hospitals welcomed him with a sort of enthusiasm.\r\n\n\r\nBut stop\u2014I must not, from the faithful narrator, degenerate into the partial\r\neulogist. Well, full well, do I know that Dr. John was not perfect, any more\r\nthan I am perfect. Human fallibility leavened him throughout: there was no\r\nhour, and scarcely a moment of the time I spent with him that in act or speech,\r\nor look, he did not betray something that was not of a god. A god could not\r\nhave the cruel vanity of Dr. John, nor his sometime levity. No immortal could\r\nhave resembled him in his occasional temporary oblivion of all but the\r\npresent\u2014in his passing passion for that present; shown not coarsely, by\r\ndevoting it to material indulgence, but selfishly, by extracting from it\r\nwhatever it could yield of nutriment to his masculine self-love: his delight\r\nwas to feed that ravenous sentiment, without thought of the price of provender,\r\nor care for the cost of keeping it sleek and high-pampered.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader is requested to note a seeming contradiction in the two views which\r\nhave been given of Graham Bretton\u2014the public and private\u2014the out-door and the\r\nin-door view. In the first, the public, he is shown oblivious of self; as\r\nmodest in the display of his energies, as earnest in their exercise. In the\r\nsecond, the fireside picture, there is expressed consciousness of what he has\r\nand what he is; pleasure in homage, some recklessness in exciting, some vanity\r\nin receiving the same. Both portraits are correct.\r\n\n\r\nIt was hardly possible to oblige Dr. John quietly and in secret. When you\r\nthought that the fabrication of some trifle dedicated to his use had been\r\nachieved unnoticed, and that, like other men, he would use it when placed ready\r\nfor his use, and never ask whence it came, he amazed you by a smilingly-uttered\r\nobservation or two, proving that his eye had been on the work from commencement\r\nto close: that he had noted the design, traced its progress, and marked its\r\ncompletion. It pleased him to be thus served, and he let his pleasure beam in\r\nhis eye and play about his mouth.\r\n\n\r\nThis would have been all very well, if he had not added to such kindly and\r\nunobtrusive evidence a certain wilfulness in discharging what he called debts.\r\nWhen his mother worked for him, he paid her by showering about her his bright\r\nanimal spirits, with even more affluence than his gay, taunting, teasing,\r\nloving wont. If Lucy Snowe were discovered to have put her hand to such work,\r\nhe planned, in recompence, some pleasant recreation.\r\n\n\r\nI often felt amazed at his perfect knowledge of Villette; a knowledge not\r\nmerely confined to its open streets, but penetrating to all its galleries,\r\nsalles, and cabinets: of every door which shut in an object worth seeing, of\r\nevery museum, of every hall, sacred to art or science, he seemed to possess the\r\n\u201cOpen! Sesame.\u201d I never had a head for science, but an ignorant, blind, fond\r\ninstinct inclined me to art. I liked to visit the picture-galleries, and I\r\ndearly liked to be left there alone. In company, a wretched idiosyncracy\r\nforbade me to see much or to feel anything. In unfamiliar company, where it was\r\nnecessary to maintain a flow of talk on the subjects in presence, half an hour\r\nwould knock me up, with a combined pressure of physical lassitude and entire\r\nmental incapacity. I never yet saw the well-reared child, much less the\r\neducated adult, who could not put me to shame, by the sustained intelligence of\r\nits demeanour under the ordeal of a conversable, sociable visitation of\r\npictures, historical sights or buildings, or any lions of public interest. Dr.\r\nBretton was a cicerone after my own heart; he would take me betimes, ere the\r\ngalleries were filled, leave me there for two or three hours, and call for me\r\nwhen his own engagements were discharged. Meantime, I was happy; happy, not\r\nalways in admiring, but in examining, questioning, and forming conclusions. In\r\nthe commencement of these visits, there was some misunderstanding and\r\nconsequent struggle between Will and Power. The former faculty exacted\r\napprobation of that which it was considered orthodox to admire; the latter\r\ngroaned forth its utter inability to pay the tax; it was then self-sneered at,\r\nspurred up, goaded on to refine its taste, and whet its zest. The more it was\r\nchidden, however, the more it wouldn\u2019t praise. Discovering gradually that a\r\nwonderful sense of fatigue resulted from these conscientious efforts, I began\r\nto reflect whether I might not dispense with that great labour, and concluded\r\neventually that I might, and so sank supine into a luxury of calm before\r\nninety-nine out of a hundred of the exhibited frames.\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed to me that an original and good picture was just as scarce as an\r\noriginal and good book; nor did I, in the end, tremble to say to myself,\r\nstanding before certain chef-d\u2019\u0153uvres bearing great names, \u201cThese are\r\nnot a whit like nature. Nature\u2019s daylight never had that colour: never was made\r\nso turbid, either by storm or cloud, as it is laid out there, under a sky of\r\nindigo: and that indigo is not ether; and those dark weeds plastered upon it\r\nare not trees.\u201d Several very well executed and complacent-looking fat women\r\nstruck me as by no means the goddesses they appeared to consider themselves.\r\nMany scores of marvellously-finished little Flemish pictures, and also of\r\nsketches, excellent for fashion-books displaying varied costumes in the\r\nhandsomest materials, gave evidence of laudable industry whimsically applied.\r\nAnd yet there were fragments of truth here and there which satisfied the\r\nconscience, and gleams of light that cheered the vision. Nature\u2019s power here\r\nbroke through in a mountain snow-storm; and there her glory in a sunny southern\r\nday. An expression in this portrait proved clear insight into character; a face\r\nin that historical painting, by its vivid filial likeness, startlingly reminded\r\nyou that genius gave it birth. These exceptions I loved: they grew dear as\r\nfriends.\r\n\n\r\nOne day, at a quiet early hour, I found myself nearly alone in a certain\r\ngallery, wherein one particular picture of portentous size, set up in the best\r\nlight, having a cordon of protection stretched before it, and a cushioned bench\r\nduly set in front for the accommodation of worshipping connoisseurs, who,\r\nhaving gazed themselves off their feet, might be fain to complete the business\r\nsitting: this picture, I say, seemed to consider itself the queen of the\r\ncollection.\r\n\n\r\nIt represented a woman, considerably larger, I thought, than the life. I\r\ncalculated that this lady, put into a scale of magnitude, suitable for the\r\nreception of a commodity of bulk, would infallibly turn from fourteen to\r\nsixteen stone. She was, indeed, extremely well fed: very much butcher\u2019s meat\u2014to\r\nsay nothing of bread, vegetables, and liquids\u2014must she have consumed to attain\r\nthat breadth and height, that wealth of muscle, that affluence of flesh. She\r\nlay half-reclined on a couch: why, it would be difficult to say; broad daylight\r\nblazed round her; she appeared in hearty health, strong enough to do the work\r\nof two plain cooks; she could not plead a weak spine; she ought to have been\r\nstanding, or at least sitting bolt upright. She, had no business to lounge away\r\nthe noon on a sofa. She ought likewise to have worn decent garments; a gown\r\ncovering her properly, which was not the case: out of abundance of\r\nmaterial\u2014seven-and-twenty yards, I should say, of drapery\u2014she managed to make\r\ninefficient raiment. Then, for the wretched untidiness surrounding her, there\r\ncould be no excuse. Pots and pans\u2014perhaps I ought to say vases and goblets\u2014were\r\nrolled here and there on the foreground; a perfect rubbish of flowers was mixed\r\namongst them, and an absurd and disorderly mass of curtain upholstery smothered\r\nthe couch and cumbered the floor. On referring to the catalogue, I found that\r\nthis notable production bore the name \u201cCleopatra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWell, I was sitting wondering at it (as the bench was there, I thought I might\r\nas well take advantage of its accommodation), and thinking that while some of\r\nthe details\u2014as roses, gold cups, jewels, &c., were very prettily painted,\r\nit was on the whole an enormous piece of claptrap; the room, almost vacant when\r\nI entered, began to fill. Scarcely noticing this circumstance (as, indeed, it\r\ndid not matter to me) I retained my seat; rather to rest myself than with a\r\nview to studying this huge, dark-complexioned gipsy-queen; of whom, indeed, I\r\nsoon tired, and betook myself for refreshment to the contemplation of some\r\nexquisite little pictures of still life: wild-flowers, wild-fruit, mossy\r\nwood-nests, casketing eggs that looked like pearls seen through clear green\r\nsea-water; all hung modestly beneath that coarse and preposterous canvas.\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly a light tap visited my shoulder. Starting, turning, I met a face bent\r\nto encounter mine; a frowning, almost a shocked face it was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue faites-vous ici?\u201d said a voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur, je m\u2019amuse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous vous amusez! et \u00e0 quoi, s\u2019il vous plait? Mais d\u2019abord, faites-moi le\r\nplaisir de vous lever; prenez mon bras, et allons de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did precisely as I was bid. M. Paul Emanuel (it was he) returned from Rome,\r\nand now a travelled man, was not likely to be less tolerant of insubordination\r\nnow, than before this added distinction laurelled his temples.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to conduct you to your party,\u201d said he, as we crossed the room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have no party.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you come here unaccompanied?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur. Dr. Bretton brought me here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton and Madame his mother, of course?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; only Dr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he told you to look at that picture?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means; I found it out for myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul\u2019s hair was shorn close as raven down, or I think it would have bristled\r\non his head. Beginning now to perceive his drift, I had a certain pleasure in\r\nkeeping cool, and working him up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAstounding insular audacity!\u201d cried the Professor. \u201cSinguli\u00e8res femmes que ces\r\nAnglaises!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMatter! How dare you, a young person, sit coolly down, with the\r\nself-possession of a gar\u00e7on, and look at that picture?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a very ugly picture, but I cannot at all see why I should not look at\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! bon! Speak no more of it. But you ought not to be here alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf, however, I have no society\u2014no party, as you say? And then, what\r\ndoes it signify whether I am alone, or accompanied? nobody meddles with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTaisez-vous, et asseyez-vous l\u00e0\u2014l\u00e0!\u201d\u2014setting down a chair with emphasis in a\r\nparticularly dull corner, before a series of most specially dreary \u201ccadres.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Mademoiselle, asseyez-vous, et ne bougez pas\u2014entendez-vous?\u2014jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce\r\nqu\u2019on vienne vous chercher, ou que je vous donne la permission.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel triste coin!\u201d cried I, \u201cet quelles laids tableaux!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd \u201claids,\u201d indeed, they were; being a set of four, denominated in the\r\ncatalogue \u201cLa vie d\u2019une femme.\u201d They were painted rather in a remarkable\r\nstyle\u2014flat, dead, pale, and formal. The first represented a \u201cJeune Fille,\u201d\r\ncoming out of a church-door, a missal in her hand, her dress very prim, her\r\neyes cast down, her mouth pursed up\u2014the image of a most villanous little\r\nprecocious she-hypocrite. The second, a \u201cMari\u00e9e,\u201d with a long white veil,\r\nkneeling at a prie-dieu in her chamber, holding her hands plastered together,\r\nfinger to finger, and showing the whites of her eyes in a most exasperating\r\nmanner. The third, a \u201cJeune M\u00e8re,\u201d hanging disconsolate over a clayey and puffy\r\nbaby with a face like an unwholesome full moon. The fourth, a \u201cVeuve,\u201d being a\r\nblack woman, holding by the hand a black little girl, and the twain studiously\r\nsurveying an elegant French monument, set up in a corner of some P\u00e8re la\r\nChaise. All these four \u201cAnges\u201d were grim and grey as burglars, and cold and\r\nvapid as ghosts. What women to live with! insincere, ill-humoured, bloodless,\r\nbrainless nonentities! As bad in their way as the indolent gipsy-giantess, the\r\nCleopatra, in hers.\r\n\n\r\nIt was impossible to keep one\u2019s attention long confined to these master-pieces,\r\nand so, by degrees, I veered round, and surveyed the gallery.\r\n\n\r\nA perfect crowd of spectators was by this time gathered round the Lioness, from\r\nwhose vicinage I had been banished; nearly half this crowd were ladies, but M.\r\nPaul afterwards told me, these were \u201cdes dames,\u201d and it was quite proper for\r\nthem to contemplate what no \u201cdemoiselle\u201d ought to glance at. I assured him\r\nplainly I could not agree in this doctrine, and did not see the sense of it;\r\nwhereupon, with his usual absolutism, he merely requested my silence, and also,\r\nin the same breath, denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance. A more\r\ndespotic little man than M. Paul never filled a professor\u2019s chair. I noticed,\r\nby the way, that he looked at the picture himself quite at his ease, and for a\r\nvery long while: he did not, however, neglect to glance from time to time my\r\nway, in order, I suppose, to make sure that I was obeying orders, and not\r\nbreaking bounds. By-and-by, he again accosted me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad I not been ill?\u201d he wished to know: \u201che understood I had.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I was now quite well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere had I spent the vacation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChiefly in the Rue Fossette; partly with Madame Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe had heard that I was left alone in the Rue Fossette; was that so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot quite alone: Marie Broc\u201d (the cr\u00e9tin) \u201cwas with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders; varied and contradictory expressions played rapidly\r\nover his countenance. Marie Broc was well known to M. Paul; he never gave a\r\nlesson in the third division (containing the least advanced pupils), that she\r\ndid not occasion in him a sharp conflict between antagonistic impressions. Her\r\npersonal appearance, her repulsive manners, her often unmanageable disposition,\r\nirritated his temper, and inspired him with strong antipathy; a feeling he was\r\ntoo apt to conceive when his taste was offended or his will thwarted. On the\r\nother hand, her misfortunes, constituted a strong claim on his forbearance and\r\ncompassion\u2014such a claim as it was not in his nature to deny; hence resulted\r\nalmost daily drawn battles between impatience and disgust on the one hand, pity\r\nand a sense of justice on the other; in which, to his credit be it said, it was\r\nvery seldom that the former feelings prevailed: when they did, however, M. Paul\r\nshowed a phase of character which had its terrors. His passions were strong,\r\nhis aversions and attachments alike vivid; the force he exerted in holding both\r\nin check by no means mitigated an observer\u2019s sense of their vehemence. With\r\nsuch tendencies, it may well be supposed he often excited in ordinary minds\r\nfear and dislike; yet it was an error to fear him: nothing drove him so nearly\r\nfrantic as the tremor of an apprehensive and distrustful spirit; nothing\r\nsoothed him like confidence tempered with gentleness. To evince these\r\nsentiments, however, required a thorough comprehension of his nature; and his\r\nnature was of an order rarely comprehended.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get on with Marie Broc?\u201d he asked, after some minutes\u2019 silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I did my best; but it was terrible to be alone with her!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have, then, a weak heart! You lack courage; and, perhaps, charity. Yours\r\nare not the qualities which might constitute a Sister of Mercy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n[He was a religious little man, in his way: the self-denying and\r\nself-sacrificing part of the Catholic religion commanded the homage of his\r\nsoul.]\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, indeed: I took as good care of her as I could; but when her aunt\r\ncame to fetch her away, it was a great relief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you are an egotist. There are women who have nursed hospitals-full of\r\nsimilar unfortunates. You could not do that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould Monsieur do it himself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWomen who are worthy the name ought infinitely to surpass; our coarse,\r\nfallible, self-indulgent sex, in the power to perform such duties.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI washed her, I kept her clean, I fed her, I tried to amuse her; but she made\r\nmouths at me instead of speaking.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think you did great things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; but as great as I could do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen limited are your powers, for in tending one idiot you fell sick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot with that, Monsieur; I had a nervous fever: my mind was ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVraiment! Vous valez peu de chose. You are not cast in an heroic mould; your\r\ncourage will not avail to sustain you in solitude; it merely gives you the\r\ntemerity to gaze with sang-froid at pictures of Cleopatra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to show anger at the teasing, hostile tone of the\r\nlittle man. I had never been angry with him yet, however, and had no present\r\ndisposition to begin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCleopatra!\u201d I repeated, quietly. \u201cMonsieur, too, has been looking at\r\nCleopatra; what does he think of her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCela ne vaut rien,\u201d he responded. \u201cUne femme superbe\u2014une taille d\u2019imp\u00e9ratrice,\r\ndes formes de Junon, mais une personne dont je ne voudrais ni pour femme, ni\r\npour fille, ni pour s\u0153ur. Aussi vous ne jeterez plus un seul coup d\u2019oeil de sa\r\nc\u00f4t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I have looked at her a great many times while Monsieur has been talking: I\r\ncan see her quite well from this corner.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTurn to the wall and study your four pictures of a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, M. Paul; they are too hideous: but if you admire them, allow me to\r\nvacate my seat and leave you to their contemplation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d he said, grimacing a half-smile, or what he intended for a\r\nsmile, though it was but a grim and hurried manifestation. \u201cYou nurslings of\r\nProtestantism astonish me. You unguarded Englishwomen walk calmly amidst\r\nred-hot ploughshares and escape burning. I believe, if some of you were thrown\r\ninto Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s hottest furnace you would issue forth untraversed by the\r\nsmell of fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill Monsieur have the goodness to move an inch to one side?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow! At what are you gazing now? You are not recognising an acquaintance\r\namongst that group of jeunes gens?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so\u2014Yes, I see there a person I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn fact, I had caught a glimpse of a head too pretty to belong to any other\r\nthan the redoubted Colonel de Hamal. What a very finished, highly polished\r\nlittle pate it was! What a figure, so trim and natty! What womanish feet and\r\nhands! How daintily he held a glass to one of his optics! with what admiration\r\nhe gazed upon the Cleopatra! and then, how engagingly he tittered and whispered\r\na friend at his elbow! Oh, the man of sense! Oh, the refined gentleman of\r\nsuperior taste and tact! I observed him for about ten minutes, and perceived\r\nthat he was exceedingly taken with this dusk and portly Venus of the Nile. So\r\nmuch was I interested in his bearing, so absorbed in divining his character by\r\nhis looks and movements, I temporarily forgot M. Paul; in the interim a group\r\ncame between that gentleman and me; or possibly his scruples might have\r\nreceived another and worse shock from my present abstraction, causing him to\r\nwithdraw voluntarily: at any rate, when I again looked round, he was gone.\r\n\n\r\nMy eye, pursuant of the search, met not him, but another and dissimilar figure,\r\nwell seen amidst the crowd, for the height as well as the port lent each its\r\ndistinction. This way came Dr. John, in visage, in shape, in hue, as unlike the\r\ndark, acerb, and caustic little professor, as the fruit of the Hesperides might\r\nbe unlike the sloe in the wild thicket; as the high-couraged but tractable\r\nArabian is unlike the rude and stubborn \u201csheltie.\u201d He was looking for me, but\r\nhad not yet explored the corner where the schoolmaster had just put me. I\r\nremained quiet; yet another minute I would watch.\r\n\n\r\nHe approached de Hamal; he paused near him; I thought he had a pleasure in\r\nlooking over his head; Dr. Bretton, too, gazed on the Cleopatra. I doubt if it\r\nwere to his taste: he did not simper like the little Count; his mouth looked\r\nfastidious, his eye cool; without demonstration he stepped aside, leaving room\r\nfor others to approach. I saw now that he was waiting, and, rising, I joined\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nWe took one turn round the gallery; with Graham it was very pleasant to take\r\nsuch a turn. I always liked dearly to hear what he had to say about either\r\npictures or books; because without pretending to be a connoisseur, he always\r\nspoke his thought, and that was sure to be fresh: very often it was also just\r\nand pithy. It was pleasant also to tell him some things he did not know\u2014he\r\nlistened so kindly, so teachably; unformalized by scruples lest so to bend his\r\nbright handsome head, to gather a woman\u2019s rather obscure and stammering\r\nexplanation, should imperil the dignity of his manhood. And when he\r\ncommunicated information in return, it was with a lucid intelligence that left\r\nall his words clear graven on the memory; no explanation of his giving, no fact\r\nof his narrating, did I ever forget.\r\n\n\r\nAs we left the gallery, I asked him what he thought of the Cleopatra (after\r\nmaking him laugh by telling him how Professor Emanuel had sent me to the right\r\nabout, and taking him to see the sweet series of pictures recommended to my\r\nattention.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh!\u201d said he. \u201cMy mother is a better-looking woman. I heard some French\r\nfops, yonder, designating her as \u2018le type du voluptueux;\u2019 if so, I can only\r\nsay, \u2018le voluptueux\u2019 is little to my liking. Compare that mulatto with\r\nGinevra!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"21": "\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE CONCERT.\n\r\nOne morning, Mrs. Bretton, coming promptly into my room, desired me to open my\r\ndrawers and show her my dresses; which I did, without a word.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said she, when she had turned them over. \u201cYou must have a new\r\none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe went out. She returned presently with a dressmaker. She had me measured. \u201cI\r\nmean,\u201d said she, \u201cto follow my own taste, and to have my own way in this little\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTwo days after came home\u2014a pink dress!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is not for me,\u201d I said, hurriedly, feeling that I would almost as soon\r\nclothe myself in the costume of a Chinese lady of rank.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see whether it is for you or not,\u201d rejoined my godmother, adding with\r\nher resistless decision: \u201cMark my words. You will wear it this very evening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I should not; I thought no human force should avail to put me into\r\nit. A pink dress! I knew it not. It knew not me. I had not proved it.\r\n\n\r\nMy godmother went on to decree that I was to go with her and Graham to a\r\nconcert that same night: which concert, she explained, was a grand affair to be\r\nheld in the large salle, or hall, of the principal musical society. The most\r\nadvanced of the pupils of the Conservatoire were to perform: it was to be\r\nfollowed by a lottery \u201cau b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pauvres;\u201d and to crown all, the King,\r\nQueen, and Prince of Labassecour were to be present. Graham, in sending\r\ntickets, had enjoined attention to costume as a compliment due to royalty: he\r\nalso recommended punctual readiness by seven o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nAbout six, I was ushered upstairs. Without any force at all, I found myself led\r\nand influenced by another\u2019s will, unconsulted, unpersuaded, quietly overruled.\r\nIn short, the pink dress went on, softened by some drapery of black lace. I was\r\npronounced to be en grande tenue, and requested to look in the glass. I did so\r\nwith some fear and trembling; with more fear and trembling, I turned away.\r\nSeven o\u2019clock struck; Dr. Bretton was come; my godmother and I went down.\r\nShe was clad in brown velvet; as I walked in her shadow, how I envied\r\nher those folds of grave, dark majesty! Graham stood in the drawing-room\r\ndoorway.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do hope he will not think I have been decking myself out to draw\r\nattention,\u201d was my uneasy aspiration.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere, Lucy, are some flowers,\u201d said he, giving me a bouquet. He took no\r\nfurther notice of my dress than was conveyed in a kind smile and satisfied nod,\r\nwhich calmed at once my sense of shame and fear of ridicule. For the rest; the\r\ndress was made with extreme simplicity, guiltless of flounce or furbelow; it\r\nwas but the light fabric and bright tint which scared me, and since Graham\r\nfound in it nothing absurd, my own eye consented soon to become reconciled.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose people who go every night to places of public amusement, can hardly\r\nenter into the fresh gala feeling with which an opera or a concert is enjoyed\r\nby those for whom it is a rarity: I am not sure that I expected great pleasure\r\nfrom the concert, having but a very vague notion of its nature, but I liked the\r\ndrive there well. The snug comfort of the close carriage on a cold though fine\r\nnight, the pleasure of setting out with companions so cheerful and friendly,\r\nthe sight of the stars glinting fitfully through the trees as we rolled along\r\nthe avenue; then the freer burst of the night-sky when we issued forth to the\r\nopen chauss\u00e9e, the passage through the city gates, the lights there burning,\r\nthe guards there posted, the pretence of inspection, to which we there\r\nsubmitted, and which amused us so much\u2014all these small matters had for me, in\r\ntheir novelty, a peculiarly exhilarating charm. How much of it lay in the\r\natmosphere of friendship diffused about me, I know not: Dr. John and his mother\r\nwere both in their finest mood, contending animatedly with each other the whole\r\nway, and as frankly kind to me as if I had been of their kin.\r\n\n\r\nOur way lay through some of the best streets of Villette, streets brightly lit,\r\nand far more lively now than at high noon. How brilliant seemed the shops! How\r\nglad, gay, and abundant flowed the tide of life along the broad pavement! While\r\nI looked, the thought of the Rue Fossette came across me\u2014of the walled-in\r\ngarden and school-house, and of the dark, vast \u201cclasses,\u201d where, as at this\r\nvery hour, it was my wont to wander all solitary, gazing at the stars through\r\nthe high, blindless windows, and listening to the distant voice of the reader\r\nin the refectory, monotonously exercised upon the \u201clecture pieuse.\u201d Thus must I\r\nsoon again listen and wander; and this shadow of the future stole with timely\r\nsobriety across the radiant present.\r\n\n\r\nBy this time we had got into a current of carriages all tending in one\r\ndirection, and soon the front of a great illuminated building blazed before us.\r\nOf what I should see within this building, I had, as before intimated, but an\r\nimperfect idea; for no place of public entertainment had it ever been my lot to\r\nenter yet.\r\n\n\r\nWe alighted under a portico where there was a great bustle and a great crowd,\r\nbut I do not distinctly remember further details, until I found myself mounting\r\na majestic staircase wide and easy of ascent, deeply and softly carpeted with\r\ncrimson, leading up to great doors closed solemnly, and whose panels were also\r\ncrimson-clothed.\r\n\n\r\nI hardly noticed by what magic these doors were made to roll back\u2014Dr. John\r\nmanaged these points; roll back they did, however, and within was disclosed a\r\nhall\u2014grand, wide, and high, whose sweeping circular walls, and domed hollow\r\nceiling, seemed to me all dead gold (thus with nice art was it stained),\r\nrelieved by cornicing, fluting, and garlandry, either bright, like gold\r\nburnished, or snow-white, like alabaster, or white and gold mingled in wreaths\r\nof gilded leaves and spotless lilies: wherever drapery hung, wherever carpets\r\nwere spread, or cushions placed, the sole colour employed was deep crimson.\r\nPendent from the dome, flamed a mass that dazzled me\u2014a mass, I thought, of\r\nrock-crystal, sparkling with facets, streaming with drops, ablaze with stars,\r\nand gorgeously tinged with dews of gems dissolved, or fragments of rainbows\r\nshivered. It was only the chandelier, reader, but for me it seemed the work of\r\neastern genii: I almost looked to see if a huge, dark, cloudy hand\u2014that of the\r\nSlave of the Lamp\u2014were not hovering in the lustrous and perfumed atmosphere of\r\nthe cupola, guarding its wondrous treasure.\r\n\n\r\nWe moved on\u2014I was not at all conscious whither\u2014but at some turn we suddenly\r\nencountered another party approaching from the opposite direction. I just now\r\nsee that group, as it flashed\u2014upon me for one moment. A handsome middle-aged\r\nlady in dark velvet; a gentleman who might be her son\u2014the best face, the finest\r\nfigure, I thought, I had ever seen; a third person in a pink dress and black\r\nlace mantle.\r\n\n\r\nI noted them all\u2014the third person as well as the other two\u2014and for the fraction\r\nof a moment believed them all strangers, thus receiving an impartial impression\r\nof their appearance. But the impression was hardly felt and not fixed, before\r\nthe consciousness that I faced a great mirror, filling a compartment between\r\ntwo pillars, dispelled it: the party was our own party. Thus for the first, and\r\nperhaps only time in my life, I enjoyed the \u201cgiftie\u201d of seeing myself as others\r\nsee me. No need to dwell on the result. It brought a jar of discord, a pang of\r\nregret; it was not flattering, yet, after all, I ought to be thankful; it might\r\nhave been worse.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, we were seated in places commanding a good general view of that vast\r\nand dazzling, but warm and cheerful hall. Already it was filled, and filled\r\nwith a splendid assemblage. I do not know that the women were very beautiful,\r\nbut their dresses were so perfect; and foreigners, even such as are ungraceful\r\nin domestic privacy, seem to possess the art of appearing graceful in public:\r\nhowever blunt and boisterous those every-day and home movements connected with\r\npeignoir and papillotes, there is a slide, a bend, a carriage of the head and\r\narms, a mien of the mouth and eyes, kept nicely in reserve for gala use\u2014always\r\nbrought out with the grande toilette, and duly put on with the \u201cparure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSome fine forms there were here and there, models of a peculiar style of\r\nbeauty; a style, I think, never seen in England; a solid, firm-set, sculptural\r\nstyle. These shapes have no angles: a caryatid in marble is almost as flexible;\r\na Phidian goddess is not more perfect in a certain still and stately sort. They\r\nhave such features as the Dutch painters give to their madonnas: low-country\r\nclassic features, regular but round, straight but stolid; and for their depth\r\nof expressionless calm, of passionless peace, a polar snow-field could alone\r\noffer a type. Women of this order need no ornament, and they seldom wear any;\r\nthe smooth hair, closely braided, supplies a sufficient contrast to the\r\nsmoother cheek and brow; the dress cannot be too simple; the rounded arm and\r\nperfect neck require neither bracelet nor chain.\r\n\n\r\nWith one of these beauties I once had the honour and rapture to be perfectly\r\nacquainted: the inert force of the deep, settled love she bore herself, was\r\nwonderful; it could only be surpassed by her proud impotency to care for any\r\nother living thing. Of blood, her cool veins conducted no flow; placid lymph\r\nfilled and almost obstructed her arteries.\r\n\n\r\nSuch a Juno as I have described sat full in our view\u2014a sort of mark for all\r\neyes, and quite conscious that so she was, but proof to the magnetic influence\r\nof gaze or glance: cold, rounded, blonde, and beauteous as the white column,\r\ncapitalled with gilding, which rose at her side.\r\n\n\r\nObserving that Dr. John\u2019s attention was much drawn towards her, I entreated him\r\nin a low voice \u201cfor the love of heaven to shield well his heart. You need not\r\nfall in love with that lady,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause, I tell you beforehand,\r\nyou might die at her feet, and she would not love you again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said he, \u201cand how do you know that the spectacle of her grand\r\ninsensibility might not with me be the strongest stimulus to homage? The sting\r\nof desperation is, I think, a wonderful irritant to my emotions: but\u201d\r\n(shrugging his shoulders) \u201cyou know nothing about these things; I\u2019ll address\r\nmyself to my mother. Mamma, I\u2019m in a dangerous way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if that interested me!\u201d said Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlas! the cruelty of my lot!\u201d responded her son. \u201cNever man had a more\r\nunsentimental mother than mine: she never seems to think that such a calamity\r\ncan befall her as a daughter-in-law.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t, it is not for want of having that same calamity held over my head:\r\nyou have threatened me with it for the last ten years. \u2018Mamma, I am going to be\r\nmarried soon!\u2019 was the cry before you were well out of jackets.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, mother, one of these days it will be realized. All of a sudden, when you\r\nthink you are most secure, I shall go forth like Jacob or Esau, or any other\r\npatriarch, and take me a wife: perhaps of these which are of the daughters of\r\nthe land.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt your peril, John Graham! that is all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis mother of mine means me to be an old bachelor. What a jealous old lady it\r\nis! But now just look at that splendid creature in the pale blue satin dress,\r\nand hair of paler brown, with \u2018reflets satin\u00e9s\u2019 as those of her robe. Would you\r\nnot feel proud, mamma, if I were to bring that goddess home some day, and\r\nintroduce her to you as Mrs. Bretton, junior?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will bring no goddess to La Terrasse: that little ch\u00e2teau will not contain\r\ntwo mistresses; especially if the second be of the height, bulk, and\r\ncircumference of that mighty doll in wood and wax, and kid and satin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma, she would fill your blue chair so admirably!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFill my chair? I defy the foreign usurper! a rueful chair should it be for\r\nher: but hush, John Graham! Hold your tongue, and use your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDuring the above skirmish, the hall, which, I had thought, seemed full at the\r\nentrance, continued to admit party after party, until the semicircle before the\r\nstage presented one dense mass of heads, sloping from floor to ceiling. The\r\nstage, too, or rather the wide temporary platform, larger than any stage,\r\ndesert half an hour since, was now overflowing with life; round two grand\r\npianos, placed about the centre, a white flock of young girls, the pupils of\r\nthe Conservatoire, had noiselessly poured. I had noticed their gathering, while\r\nGraham and his mother were engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin, and\r\nhad watched with interest the process of arraying and marshalling them. Two\r\ngentlemen, in each of whom I recognised an acquaintance, officered this virgin\r\ntroop. One, an artistic-looking man, bearded, and with long hair, was a noted\r\npianiste, and also the first music-teacher in Villette; he attended twice a\r\nweek at Madame Beck\u2019s pensionnat, to give lessons to the few pupils whose\r\nparents were rich enough to allow their daughters the privilege of his\r\ninstructions; his name was M. Josef Emanuel, and he was half-brother to M.\r\nPaul: which potent personage was now visible in the person of the second\r\ngentleman.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul amused me; I smiled to myself as I watched him, he seemed so thoroughly\r\nin his element\u2014standing conspicuous in presence of a wide and grand assemblage,\r\narranging, restraining, over-aweing about one hundred young ladies. He was,\r\ntoo, so perfectly in earnest\u2014so energetic, so intent, and, above all, so\r\nabsolute: and yet what business had he there? What had he to do with music or\r\nthe Conservatoire\u2014he who could hardly distinguish one note from another? I knew\r\nthat it was his love of display and authority which had brought him there\u2014a\r\nlove not offensive, only because so naive. It presently became obvious that his\r\nbrother, M. Josef, was as much under his control as were the girls themselves.\r\nNever was such a little hawk of a man as that M. Paul! Ere long, some noted\r\nsingers and musicians dawned upon the platform: as these stars rose, the\r\ncomet-like professor set. Insufferable to him were all notorieties and\r\ncelebrities: where he could not outshine, he fled.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now all was prepared: but one compartment of the hall waited to be filled\u2014a\r\ncompartment covered with crimson, like the grand staircase and doors, furnished\r\nwith stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged on each side of two regal chairs,\r\nplaced solemnly under a canopy.\r\n\n\r\nA signal was given, the doors rolled back, the assembly stood up, the orchestra\r\nburst out, and, to the welcome of a choral burst, enter the King, the Queen,\r\nthe Court of Labassecour.\r\n\n\r\nTill then, I had never set eyes on living king or queen; it may consequently be\r\nconjectured how I strained my powers of vision to take in these specimens of\r\nEuropean royalty. By whomsoever majesty is beheld for the first time, there\r\nwill always be experienced a vague surprise bordering on disappointment, that\r\nthe same does not appear seated, en permanence, on a throne, bonneted with a\r\ncrown, and furnished, as to the hand, with a sceptre. Looking out for a king\r\nand queen, and seeing only a middle-aged soldier and a rather young lady, I\r\nfelt half cheated, half pleased.\r\n\n\r\nWell do I recall that King\u2014a man of fifty, a little bowed, a little grey: there\r\nwas no face in all that assembly which resembled his. I had never read, never\r\nbeen told anything of his nature or his habits; and at first the strong\r\nhieroglyphics graven as with iron stylet on his brow, round his eyes, beside\r\nhis mouth, puzzled and baffled instinct. Ere long, however, if I did not know,\r\nat least I felt, the meaning of those characters written without hand. There\r\nsat a silent sufferer\u2014a nervous, melancholy man. Those eyes had looked on the\r\nvisits of a certain ghost\u2014had long waited the comings and goings of that\r\nstrangest spectre, Hypochondria. Perhaps he saw her now on that stage, over\r\nagainst him, amidst all that brilliant throng. Hypochondria has that wont, to\r\nrise in the midst of thousands\u2014dark as Doom, pale as Malady, and well-nigh\r\nstrong as Death. Her comrade and victim thinks to be happy one moment\u2014\u201cNot so,\u201d\r\nsays she; \u201cI come.\u201d And she freezes the blood in his heart, and beclouds the\r\nlight in his eye.\r\n\n\r\nSome might say it was the foreign crown pressing the King\u2019s brows which bent\r\nthem to that peculiar and painful fold; some might quote the effects of early\r\nbereavement. Something there might be of both these; but these are embittered\r\nby that darkest foe of humanity\u2014constitutional melancholy. The Queen, his wife,\r\nknew this: it seemed to me, the reflection of her husband\u2019s grief lay, a\r\nsubduing shadow, on her own benignant face. A mild, thoughtful, graceful woman\r\nthat princess seemed; not beautiful, not at all like the women of solid charms\r\nand marble feelings described a page or two since. Hers was a somewhat slender\r\nshape; her features, though distinguished enough, were too suggestive of\r\nreigning dynasties and royal lines to give unqualified pleasure. The expression\r\nclothing that profile was agreeable in the present instance; but you could not\r\navoid connecting it with remembered effigies, where similar lines appeared,\r\nunder phase ignoble; feeble, or sensual, or cunning, as the case might be. The\r\nQueen\u2019s eye, however, was her own; and pity, goodness, sweet sympathy, blessed\r\nit with divinest light. She moved no sovereign, but a lady\u2014kind, loving,\r\nelegant. Her little son, the Prince of Labassecour, and young Duc de\r\nDindonneau, accompanied her: he leaned on his mother\u2019s knee; and, ever and\r\nanon, in the course of that evening, I saw her observant of the monarch at her\r\nside, conscious of his beclouded abstraction, and desirous to rouse him from it\r\nby drawing his attention to their son. She often bent her head to listen to the\r\nboy\u2019s remarks, and would then smilingly repeat them to his sire. The moody King\r\nstarted, listened, smiled, but invariably relapsed as soon as his good angel\r\nceased speaking. Full mournful and significant was that spectacle! Not the less\r\nso because, both for the aristocracy and the honest bourgeoisie of Labassecour,\r\nits peculiarity seemed to be wholly invisible: I could not discover that one\r\nsoul present was either struck or touched.\r\n\n\r\nWith the King and Queen had entered their court, comprising two or three\r\nforeign ambassadors; and with them came the elite of the foreigners then\r\nresident in Villette. These took possession of the crimson benches; the ladies\r\nwere seated; most of the men remained standing: their sable rank, lining the\r\nbackground, looked like a dark foil to the splendour displayed in front. Nor\r\nwas this splendour without varying light and shade and gradation: the middle\r\ndistance was filled with matrons in velvets and satins, in plumes and gems; the\r\nbenches in the foreground, to the Queen\u2019s right hand, seemed devoted\r\nexclusively to young girls, the flower\u2014perhaps, I should rather say, the bud\u2014of\r\nVillette aristocracy. Here were no jewels, no head-dresses, no velvet pile or\r\nsilken sheen: purity, simplicity, and a\u00ebrial grace reigned in that virgin band.\r\nYoung heads simply braided, and fair forms (I was going to write sylph\r\nforms, but that would have been quite untrue: several of these \u201cjeunes filles,\u201d\r\nwho had not numbered more than sixteen or seventeen years, boasted contours as\r\nrobust and solid as those of a stout Englishwoman of five-and-twenty)\u2014fair\r\nforms robed in white, or pale rose, or placid blue, suggested thoughts of\r\nheaven and angels. I knew a couple, at least, of these \u201crose et blanche\u201d\r\nspecimens of humanity. Here was a pair of Madame Beck\u2019s late\r\npupils\u2014Mesdemoiselles Mathilde and Ang\u00e9lique: pupils who, during their last\r\nyear at school, ought to have been in the first class, but whose brains never\r\ngot them beyond the second division. In English, they had been under my own\r\ncharge, and hard work it was to get them to translate rationally a page of\r\nThe Vicar of Wakefield. Also during three months I had one of them for\r\nmy vis-\u00e0-vis at table, and the quantity of household bread, butter, and stewed\r\nfruit, she would habitually consume at \u201csecond d\u00e9jeuner\u201d was a real world\u2019s\r\nwonder\u2014to be exceeded only by the fact of her actually pocketing slices she\r\ncould not eat. Here be truths\u2014wholesome truths, too.\r\n\n\r\nI knew another of these seraphs\u2014the prettiest, or, at any rate, the least\r\ndemure and hypocritical looking of the lot: she was seated by the daughter of\r\nan English peer, also an honest, though haughty-looking girl: both had entered\r\nin the suite of the British embassy. She (i.e. my acquaintance) had a\r\nslight, pliant figure, not at all like the forms of the foreign damsels: her\r\nhair, too, was not close-braided, like a shell or a skull-cap of satin; it\r\nlooked like hair, and waved from her head, long, curled, and flowing.\r\nShe chatted away volubly, and seemed full of a light-headed sort of\r\nsatisfaction with herself and her position. I did not look at Dr. Bretton; but\r\nI knew that he, too, saw Ginevra Fanshawe: he had become so quiet, he answered\r\nso briefly his mother\u2019s remarks, he so often suppressed a sigh. Why should he\r\nsigh? He had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under difficulties; here\r\nwas full gratification for that taste. His lady-love beamed upon him from a\r\nsphere above his own: he could not come near her; he was not certain that he\r\ncould win from her a look. I watched to see if she would so far favour him. Our\r\nseat was not far from the crimson benches; we must inevitably be seen thence,\r\nby eyes so quick and roving as Miss Fanshawe\u2019s, and very soon those optics of\r\nhers were upon us: at least, upon Dr. and Mrs. Bretton. I kept rather in the\r\nshade and out of sight, not wishing to be immediately recognised: she looked\r\nquite steadily at Dr. John, and then she raised a glass to examine his mother;\r\na minute or two afterwards she laughingly whispered her neighbour; upon the\r\nperformance commencing, her rambling attention was attracted to the platform.\r\n\n\r\nOn the concert I need not dwell; the reader would not care to have my\r\nimpressions thereanent: and, indeed, it would not be worth while to record\r\nthem, as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse. The young ladies of\r\nthe Conservatoire, being very much frightened, made rather a tremulous\r\nexhibition on the two grand pianos. M. Josef Emanuel stood by them while they\r\nplayed; but he had not the tact or influence of his kinsman, who, under similar\r\ncircumstances, would certainly have compelled pupils of his to demean\r\nthemselves with heroism and self-possession. M. Paul would have placed the\r\nhysteric d\u00e9butantes between two fires\u2014terror of the audience, and terror of\r\nhimself\u2014and would have inspired them with the courage of desperation, by making\r\nthe latter terror incomparably the greater: M. Josef could not do this.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing the white muslin pianistes, came a fine, full-grown, sulky lady in\r\nwhite satin. She sang. Her singing just affected me like the tricks of a\r\nconjuror: I wondered how she did it\u2014how she made her voice run up and down, and\r\ncut such marvellous capers; but a simple Scotch melody, played by a rude street\r\nminstrel, has often moved me more deeply.\r\n\n\r\nAfterwards stepped forth a gentleman, who, bending his body a good deal in the\r\ndirection of the King and Queen, and frequently approaching his white-gloved\r\nhand to the region of his heart, vented a bitter outcry against a certain\r\n\u201cfausse Isabelle.\u201d I thought he seemed especially to solicit the Queen\u2019s\r\nsympathy; but, unless I am egregiously mistaken, her Majesty lent her attention\r\nrather with the calm of courtesy than the earnestness of interest. This\r\ngentleman\u2019s state of mind was very harrowing, and I was glad when he wound up\r\nhis musical exposition of the same.\r\n\n\r\nSome rousing choruses struck me as the best part of the evening\u2019s\r\nentertainment. There were present deputies from all the best provincial choral\r\nsocieties; genuine, barrel-shaped, native Labassecouriens. These worthies gave\r\nvoice without mincing the matter their hearty exertions had at least this good\r\nresult\u2014the ear drank thence a satisfying sense of power.\r\n\n\r\nThrough the whole performance\u2014timid instrumental duets, conceited vocal solos,\r\nsonorous, brass-lunged choruses\u2014my attention gave but one eye and one ear to\r\nthe stage, the other being permanently retained in the service of Dr. Bretton:\r\nI could not forget him, nor cease to question how he was feeling, what he was\r\nthinking, whether he was amused or the contrary. At last he spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you like it all, Lucy? You are very quiet,\u201d he said, in his own\r\ncheerful tone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am quiet,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I am so very, very much interested: not\r\nmerely with the music, but with everything about me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then proceeded to make some further remarks, with so much equanimity and\r\ncomposure that I began to think he had really not seen what I had seen, and I\r\nwhispered\u2014\u201cMiss Fanshawe is here: have you noticed her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! and I observed that you noticed her too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she come with Mrs. Cholmondeley, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Cholmondeley is there with a very grand party. Yes; Ginevra was in\r\nher train; and Mrs. Cholmondeley was in Lady \u2014\u2014\u2019s train, who was in the\r\nQueen\u2019s train. If this were not one of the compact little minor European\r\ncourts, whose very formalities are little more imposing than familiarities, and\r\nwhose gala grandeur is but homeliness in Sunday array, it would sound all very\r\nfine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra saw you, I think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo do I think so. I have had my eye on her several times since you withdrew\r\nyours; and I have had the honour of witnessing a little spectacle which you\r\nwere spared.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not ask what; I waited voluntary information, which was presently given.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Fanshawe,\u201d he said, \u201chas a companion with her\u2014a lady of rank. I happen to\r\nknow Lady Sara by sight; her noble mother has called me in professionally. She\r\nis a proud girl, but not in the least insolent, and I doubt whether Ginevra\r\nwill have gained ground in her estimation by making a butt of her neighbours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat neighbours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerely myself and my mother. As to me it is all very natural: nothing, I\r\nsuppose, can be fairer game than the young bourgeois doctor; but my mother! I\r\nnever saw her ridiculed before. Do you know, the curling lip, and sarcastically\r\nlevelled glass thus directed, gave me a most curious sensation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Dr. John: it is not worth while. If Ginevra were in a\r\ngiddy mood, as she is eminently to-night, she would make no scruple of laughing\r\nat that mild, pensive Queen, or that melancholy King. She is not actuated by\r\nmalevolence, but sheer, heedless folly. To a feather-brained school-girl\r\nnothing is sacred.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you forget: I have not been accustomed to look on Miss Fanshawe in the\r\nlight of a feather-brained school-girl. Was she not my divinity\u2014the angel of my\r\ncareer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHem! There was your mistake.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo speak the honest truth, without any false rant or assumed romance, there\r\nactually was a moment, six months ago, when I thought her divine. Do you\r\nremember our conversation about the presents? I was not quite open with you in\r\ndiscussing that subject: the warmth with which you took it up amused me. By way\r\nof having the full benefit of your lights, I allowed you to think me more in\r\nthe dark than I really was. It was that test of the presents which first proved\r\nGinevra mortal. Still her beauty retained its fascination: three days\u2014three\r\nhours ago, I was very much her slave. As she passed me to-night, triumphant in\r\nbeauty, my emotions did her homage; but for one luckless sneer, I should yet be\r\nthe humblest of her servants. She might have scoffed at me, and, while\r\nwounding, she would not soon have alienated me: through myself, she could not\r\nin ten years have done what, in a moment, she has done through my mother.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held his peace awhile. Never before had I seen so much fire, and so little\r\nsunshine in Dr. John\u2019s blue eye as just now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d he recommenced, \u201clook well at my mother, and say, without fear or\r\nfavour, in what light she now appears to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs she always does\u2014an English, middle-class gentlewoman; well, though gravely\r\ndressed, habitually independent of pretence, constitutionally composed and\r\ncheerful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo she seems to me\u2014bless her! The merry may laugh with mamma, but the\r\nweak only will laugh at her. She shall not be ridiculed, with my\r\nconsent, at least; nor without my\u2014my scorn\u2014my antipathy\u2014my\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped: and it was time\u2014for he was getting excited\u2014more it seemed than the\r\noccasion warranted. I did not then know that he had witnessed double cause for\r\ndissatisfaction with Miss Fanshawe. The glow of his complexion, the expansion\r\nof his nostril, the bold curve which disdain gave his well-cut under lip,\r\nshowed him in a new and striking phase. Yet the rare passion of the\r\nconstitutionally suave and serene, is not a pleasant spectacle; nor did I like\r\nthe sort of vindictive thrill which passed through his strong young frame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo I frighten you, Lucy?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell why you are so very angry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor this reason,\u201d he muttered in my ear. \u201cGinevra is neither a pure angel, nor\r\na pure-minded woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! you exaggerate: she has no great harm in her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cToo much for me. I can see where you are blind. Now dismiss the\r\nsubject. Let me amuse myself by teasing mamma: I will assert that she is\r\nflagging. Mamma, pray rouse yourself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJohn, I will certainly rouse you if you are not better conducted. Will you and\r\nLucy be silent, that I may hear the singing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey were then thundering in a chorus, under cover of which all the previous\r\ndialogue had taken place.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou hear the singing, mamma! Now, I will wager my studs, which are\r\ngenuine, against your paste brooch\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy paste brooch, Graham? Profane boy! you know that it is a stone of value.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! that is one of your superstitions: you were cheated in the business.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am cheated in fewer things than you imagine. How do you happen to be\r\nacquainted with young ladies of the court, John? I have observed two of them\r\npay you no small attention during the last half-hour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would not observe them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not? Because one of them satirically levels her eyeglass at me? She is a\r\npretty, silly girl: but are you apprehensive that her titter will discomfit the\r\nold lady?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sensible, admirable old lady! Mother, you are better to me than ten wives\r\nyet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be demonstrative, John, or I shall faint, and you will have to carry me\r\nout; and if that burden were laid upon you, you would reverse your last speech,\r\nand exclaim, \u2018Mother, ten wives could hardly be worse to me than you are!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe concert over, the Lottery \u201cau b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pauvres\u201d came next: the interval\r\nbetween was one of general relaxation, and the pleasantest imaginable stir and\r\ncommotion. The white flock was cleared from the platform; a busy throng of\r\ngentlemen crowded it instead, making arrangements for the drawing; and amongst\r\nthese\u2014the busiest of all\u2014re-appeared that certain well-known form, not tall but\r\nactive, alive with the energy and movement of three tall men. How M. Paul did\r\nwork! How he issued directions, and, at the same time, set his own shoulder to\r\nthe wheel! Half-a-dozen assistants were at his beck to remove the pianos,\r\n&c.; no matter, he must add to their strength his own. The redundancy of\r\nhis alertness was half-vexing, half-ludicrous: in my mind I both disapproved\r\nand derided most of this fuss. Yet, in the midst of prejudice and annoyance, I\r\ncould not, while watching, avoid perceiving a certain not disagreeable na\u00efvet\u00e9\r\nin all he did and said; nor could I be blind to certain vigorous\r\ncharacteristics of his physiognomy, rendered conspicuous now by the contrast\r\nwith a throng of tamer faces: the deep, intent keenness of his eye, the power\r\nof his forehead, pale, broad, and full\u2014the mobility of his most flexible mouth.\r\nHe lacked the calm of force, but its movement and its fire he signally\r\npossessed.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime the whole hall was in a stir; most people rose and remained standing,\r\nfor a change; some walked about, all talked and laughed. The crimson\r\ncompartment presented a peculiarly animated scene. The long cloud of gentlemen,\r\nbreaking into fragments, mixed with the rainbow line of ladies; two or three\r\nofficer-like men approached the King and conversed with him. The Queen, leaving\r\nher chair, glided along the rank of young ladies, who all stood up as she\r\npassed; and to each in turn I saw her vouchsafe some token of kindness\u2014a\r\ngracious word, look or smile. To the two pretty English girls, Lady Sara and\r\nGinevra Fanshawe, she addressed several sentences; as she left them, both, and\r\nespecially the latter, seemed to glow all over with gratification. They were\r\nafterwards accosted by several ladies, and a little circle of gentlemen\r\ngathered round them; amongst these\u2014the nearest to Ginevra\u2014stood the Count de\r\nHamal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis room is stiflingly hot,\u201d said Dr. Bretton, rising with sudden impatience.\r\n\u201cLucy\u2014mother\u2014will you come a moment to the fresh air?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo with him, Lucy,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton. \u201cI would rather keep my seat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWillingly would I have kept mine also, but Graham\u2019s desire must take precedence\r\nof my own; I accompanied him.\r\n\n\r\nWe found the night-air keen; or at least I did: he did not seem to feel it; but\r\nit was very still, and the star-sown sky spread cloudless. I was wrapped in a\r\nfur shawl. We took some turns on the pavement; in passing under a lamp, Graham\r\nencountered my eye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look pensive, Lucy: is it on my account?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was only fearing that you were grieved.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all: so be of good cheer\u2014as I am. Whenever I die, Lucy, my persuasion\r\nis that it will not be of heart-complaint. I may be stung, I may seem to droop\r\nfor a time, but no pain or malady of sentiment has yet gone through my whole\r\nsystem. You have always seen me cheerful at home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGenerally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad she laughed at my mother. I would not give the old lady for a dozen\r\nbeauties. That sneer did me all the good in the world. Thank you, Miss\r\nFanshawe!\u201d And he lifted his hat from his waved locks, and made a mock\r\nreverence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI thank her. She has made me feel that nine parts in ten of my\r\nheart have always been sound as a bell, and the tenth bled from a mere\r\npuncture: a lancet-prick that will heal in a trice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are angry just now, heated and indignant; you will think and feel\r\ndifferently to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI heated and indignant! You don\u2019t know me. On the contrary, the heat is\r\ngone: I am as cool as the night\u2014which, by the way, may be too cool for you. We\r\nwill go back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John, this is a sudden change.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot it: or if it be, there are good reasons for it\u2014two good reasons: I have\r\ntold you one. But now let us re-enter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe did not easily regain our seats; the lottery was begun, and all was excited\r\nconfusion; crowds blocked the sort of corridor along which we had to pass: it\r\nwas necessary to pause for a time. Happening to glance round\u2014indeed I half\r\nfancied I heard my name pronounced\u2014I saw quite near, the ubiquitous, the\r\ninevitable M. Paul. He was looking at me gravely and intently: at me, or rather\r\nat my pink dress\u2014sardonic comment on which gleamed in his eye. Now it was his\r\nhabit to indulge in strictures on the dress, both of the teachers and pupils,\r\nat Madame Beck\u2019s\u2014a habit which the former, at least, held to be an offensive\r\nimpertinence: as yet I had not suffered from it\u2014my sombre daily attire not\r\nbeing calculated to attract notice. I was in no mood to permit any new\r\nencroachment to-night: rather than accept his banter, I would ignore his\r\npresence, and accordingly steadily turned my face to the sleeve of Dr. John\u2019s\r\ncoat; finding in that same black sleeve a prospect more redolent of pleasure\r\nand comfort, more genial, more friendly, I thought, than was offered by the\r\ndark little Professor\u2019s unlovely visage. Dr. John seemed unconsciously to\r\nsanction the preference by looking down and saying in his kind voice, \u201cAy, keep\r\nclose to my side, Lucy: these crowding burghers are no respecters of persons.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not, however, be true to myself. Yielding to some influence, mesmeric\r\nor otherwise\u2014an influence unwelcome, displeasing, but effective\u2014I again glanced\r\nround to see if M. Paul was gone. No, there he stood on the same spot, looking\r\nstill, but with a changed eye; he had penetrated my thought, and read my wish\r\nto shun him. The mocking but not ill-humoured gaze was turned to a swarthy\r\nfrown, and when I bowed, with a view to conciliation, I got only the stiffest\r\nand sternest of nods in return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhom have you made angry, Lucy?\u201d whispered Dr. Bretton, smiling. \u201cWho is that\r\nsavage-looking friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne of the professors at Madame Beck\u2019s: a very cross little man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe looks mighty cross just now: what have you done to him? What is it all\r\nabout? Ah, Lucy, Lucy! tell me the meaning of this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo mystery, I assure you. M. Emanuel is very exigeant, and because I looked at\r\nyour coat-sleeve, instead of curtseying and dipping to him, he thinks I have\r\nfailed in respect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe little\u2014\u201d began Dr. John: I know not what more he would have added, for at\r\nthat moment I was nearly thrown down amongst the feet of the crowd. M. Paul had\r\nrudely pushed past, and was elbowing his way with such utter disregard to the\r\nconvenience and security of all around, that a very uncomfortable pressure was\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think he is what he himself would call \u2018m\u00e9chant,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Bretton. I\r\nthought so, too.\r\n\n\r\nSlowly and with difficulty we made our way along the passage, and at last\r\nregained our seats. The drawing of the lottery lasted nearly an hour; it was an\r\nanimating and amusing scene; and as we each held tickets, we shared in the\r\nalternations of hope and fear raised by each turn of the wheel. Two little\r\ngirls, of five and six years old, drew the numbers: and the prizes were duly\r\nproclaimed from the platform. These prizes were numerous, though of small\r\nvalue. It so fell out that Dr. John and I each gained one: mine was a\r\ncigar-case, his a lady\u2019s head-dress\u2014a most airy sort of blue and silver turban,\r\nwith a streamer of plumage on one side, like a snowy cloud. He was excessively\r\nanxious to make an exchange; but I could not be brought to hear reason, and to\r\nthis day I keep my cigar-case: it serves, when I look at it, to remind me of\r\nold times, and one happy evening.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John, for his part, held his turban at arm\u2019s length between his finger and\r\nthumb, and looked at it with a mixture of reverence and embarrassment highly\r\nprovocative of laughter. The contemplation over, he was about coolly to deposit\r\nthe delicate fabric on the ground between his feet; he seemed to have no shadow\r\nof an idea of the treatment or stowage it ought to receive: if his mother had\r\nnot come to the rescue, I think he would finally have crushed it under his arm\r\nlike an opera-hat; she restored it to the band-box whence it had issued.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was quite cheerful all the evening, and his cheerfulness seemed natural\r\nand unforced. His demeanour, his look, is not easily described; there was\r\nsomething in it peculiar, and, in its way, original. I read in it no common\r\nmastery of the passions, and a fund of deep and healthy strength which, without\r\nany exhausting effort, bore down Disappointment and extracted her fang. His\r\nmanner, now, reminded me of qualities I had noticed in him when professionally\r\nengaged amongst the poor, the guilty, and the suffering, in the Basse-Ville: he\r\nlooked at once determined, enduring, and sweet-tempered. Who could help liking\r\nhim? He betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with\r\nconsiderations as to how its faltering must be propped; from him broke\r\nno irritability which startled calm and quenched mirth; his lips let\r\nfall no caustic that burned to the bone; his eye shot no morose shafts\r\nthat went cold, and rusty, and venomed through your heart: beside him was rest\r\nand refuge\u2014around him, fostering sunshine.\r\n\n\r\nAnd yet he had neither forgiven nor forgotten Miss Fanshawe. Once angered, I\r\ndoubt if Dr. Bretton were to be soon propitiated\u2014once alienated, whether he\r\nwere ever to be reclaimed. He looked at her more than once; not stealthily or\r\nhumbly, but with a movement of hardy, open observation. De Hamal was now a\r\nfixture beside her; Mrs. Cholmondeley sat near, and they and she were wholly\r\nabsorbed in the discourse, mirth, and excitement, with which the crimson seats\r\nwere as much astir as any plebeian part of the hall. In the course of some\r\napparently animated discussion, Ginevra once or twice lifted her hand and arm;\r\na handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter. I saw that its gleam flickered in\r\nDr. John\u2019s eye\u2014quickening therein a derisive, ireful sparkle; he laughed:\u2014\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cI will lay my turban on my wonted altar of offerings;\r\nthere, at any rate, it would be certain to find favour: no grisette has a more\r\nfacile faculty of acceptance. Strange! for after all, I know she is a girl of\r\nfamily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know her education, Dr. John,\u201d said I. \u201cTossed about all her\r\nlife from one foreign school to another, she may justly proffer the plea of\r\nignorance in extenuation of most of her faults. And then, from what she says, I\r\nbelieve her father and mother were brought up much as she has been brought up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI always understood she had no fortune; and once I had pleasure in the\r\nthought,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe tells me,\u201d I answered, \u201cthat they are poor at home; she always speaks\r\nquite candidly on such points: you never find her lying, as these foreigners\r\nwill often lie. Her parents have a large family: they occupy such a station and\r\npossess such connections as, in their opinion, demand display; stringent\r\nnecessity of circumstances and inherent thoughtlessness of disposition\r\ncombined, have engendered reckless unscrupulousness as to how they obtain the\r\nmeans of sustaining a good appearance. This is the state of things, and the\r\nonly state of things, she has seen from childhood upwards.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe it\u2014and I thought to mould her to something better: but, Lucy, to\r\nspeak the plain truth, I have felt a new thing to-night, in looking at her and\r\nde Hamal. I felt it before noticing the impertinence directed at my mother. I\r\nsaw a look interchanged between them immediately after their entrance, which\r\nthrew a most unwelcome light on my mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you mean? You have been long aware of the flirtation they keep up?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, flirtation! That might be an innocent girlish wile to lure on the true\r\nlover; but what I refer to was not flirtation: it was a look marking mutual and\r\nsecret understanding\u2014it was neither girlish nor innocent. No woman, were she as\r\nbeautiful as Aphrodite, who could give or receive such a glance, shall ever be\r\nsought in marriage by me: I would rather wed a paysanne in a short petticoat\r\nand high cap\u2014and be sure that she was honest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help smiling. I felt sure he now exaggerated the case: Ginevra, I\r\nwas certain, was honest enough, with all her giddiness. I told him so. He shook\r\nhis head, and said he would not be the man to trust her with his honour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe only thing,\u201d said I, \u201cwith which you may safely trust her. She would\r\nunscrupulously damage a husband\u2019s purse and property, recklessly try his\r\npatience and temper: I don\u2019t think she would breathe, or let another breathe,\r\non his honour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are becoming her advocate,\u201d said he. \u201cDo you wish me to resume my old\r\nchains?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I am glad to see you free, and trust that free you will long remain. Yet\r\nbe, at the same time, just.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so: just as Rhadamanthus, Lucy. When once I am thoroughly estranged, I\r\ncannot help being severe. But look! the King and Queen are rising. I like that\r\nQueen: she has a sweet countenance. Mamma, too, is excessively tired; we shall\r\nnever get the old lady home if we stay longer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tired, John?\u201d cried Mrs. Bretton, looking at least as animated and as\r\nwide-awake as her son. \u201cI would undertake to sit you out yet: leave us both\r\nhere till morning, and we should see which would look the most jaded by\r\nsunrise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should not like to try the experiment; for, in truth, mamma, you are the\r\nmost unfading of evergreens and the freshest of matrons. It must then be on the\r\nplea of your son\u2019s delicate nerves and fragile constitution that I found a\r\npetition for our speedy adjournment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndolent young man! You wish you were in bed, no doubt; and I suppose you must\r\nbe humoured. There is Lucy, too, looking quite done up. For shame, Lucy! At\r\nyour age, a week of evenings-out would not have made me a shade paler. Come\r\naway, both of you; and you may laugh at the old lady as much as you please,\r\nbut, for my part, I shall take charge of the bandbox and turban.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich she did accordingly. I offered to relieve her, but was shaken off with\r\nkindly contempt: my godmother opined that I had enough to do to take care of\r\nmyself. Not standing on ceremony now, in the midst of the gay \u201cconfusion worse\r\nconfounded\u201d succeeding to the King and Queen\u2019s departure, Mrs. Bretton preceded\r\nus, and promptly made us a lane through the crowd. Graham followed,\r\napostrophizing his mother as the most flourishing grisette it had ever been his\r\ngood fortune to see charged with carriage of a bandbox; he also desired me to\r\nmark her affection for the sky-blue turban, and announced his conviction that\r\nshe intended one day to wear it.\r\n\n\r\nThe night was now very cold and very dark, but with little delay we found the\r\ncarriage. Soon we were packed in it, as warm and as snug as at a fire-side; and\r\nthe drive home was, I think, still pleasanter than the drive to the concert.\r\nPleasant it was, even though the coachman\u2014having spent in the shop of a\r\n\u201cmarchand de vin\u201d a portion of the time we passed at the concert\u2014drove us along\r\nthe dark and solitary chauss\u00e9e far past the turn leading down to La Terrasse;\r\nwe, who were occupied in talking and laughing, not noticing the aberration\r\ntill, at last, Mrs. Bretton intimated that, though she had always thought the\r\nch\u00e2teau a retired spot, she did not know it was situated at the world\u2019s end, as\r\nshe declared seemed now to be the case, for she believed we had been an hour\r\nand a half en route, and had not yet taken the turn down the avenue.\r\n\n\r\nThen Graham looked out, and perceiving only dim-spread fields, with unfamiliar\r\nrows of pollards and limes ranged along their else invisible sunk-fences, began\r\nto conjecture how matters were, and calling a halt and descending, he mounted\r\nthe box and took the reins himself. Thanks to him, we arrived safe at home\r\nabout an hour and a half beyond our time.\r\n\n\r\nMartha had not forgotten us; a cheerful fire was burning, and a neat supper\r\nspread in the dining-room: we were glad of both. The winter dawn was actually\r\nbreaking before we gained our chambers. I took off my pink dress and lace\r\nmantle with happier feelings than I had experienced in putting them on. Not\r\nall, perhaps, who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say the\r\nsame; for not all had been satisfied with friendship\u2014with its calm comfort and\r\nmodest hope.\r\n\n"}
{"22": "\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nREACTION.\n\r\nYet three days, and then I must go back to the pensionnat. I almost\r\nnumbered the moments of these days upon the clock; fain would I have retarded\r\ntheir flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they were already gone\r\nwhile I yet feared their departure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy will not leave us to-day,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, coaxingly at breakfast;\r\n\u201cshe knows we can procure a second respite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would not ask for one if I might have it for a word,\u201d said I. \u201cI long to get\r\nthe good-by over, and to be settled in the Rue Fossette again. I must go this\r\nmorning: I must go directly; my trunk is packed and corded.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt appeared; however, that my going depended upon Graham; he had said he would\r\naccompany me, and it so fell out that he was engaged all day, and only\r\nreturned home at dusk. Then ensued a little combat of words. Mrs. Bretton and\r\nher son pressed me to remain one night more. I could have cried, so irritated\r\nand eager was I to be gone. I longed to leave them as the criminal on the\r\nscaffold longs for the axe to descend: that is, I wished the pang over. How\r\nmuch I wished it, they could not tell. On these points, mine was a state of\r\nmind out of their experience.\r\n\n\r\nIt was dark when Dr. John handed me from the carriage at Madame Beck\u2019s door.\r\nThe lamp above was lit; it rained a November drizzle, as it had rained all day:\r\nthe lamplight gleamed on the wet pavement. Just such a night was it as that on\r\nwhich, not a year ago, I had first stopped at this very threshold; just similar\r\nwas the scene. I remembered the very shapes of the paving-stones which I had\r\nnoted with idle eye, while, with a thick-beating heart, I waited the unclosing\r\nof that door at which I stood\u2014a solitary and a suppliant. On that night, too, I\r\nhad briefly met him who now stood with me. Had I ever reminded him of that\r\nrencontre, or explained it? I had not, nor ever felt the inclination to do so:\r\nit was a pleasant thought, laid by in my own mind, and best kept there.\r\n\n\r\nGraham rung the bell. The door was instantly opened, for it was just that\r\nperiod of the evening when the half-boarders took their departure\u2014consequently,\r\nRosine was on the alert.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in,\u201d said I to him; but he stepped a moment into the well-lighted\r\nvestibule. I had not wished him to see that \u201cthe water stood in my eyes,\u201d for\r\nhis was too kind a nature ever to be needlessly shown such signs of sorrow. He\r\nalways wished to heal\u2014to relieve\u2014when, physician as he was, neither cure nor\r\nalleviation were, perhaps, in his power.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep up your courage, Lucy. Think of my mother and myself as true friends. We\r\nwill not forget you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor will I forget you, Dr. John.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy trunk was now brought in. We had shaken hands; he had turned to go, but he\r\nwas not satisfied: he had not done or said enough to content his generous\r\nimpulses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d\u2014stepping after me\u2014\u201cshall you feel very solitary here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt first I shall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, my mother will soon call to see you; and, meantime, I\u2019ll tell you what\r\nI\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll write\u2014just any cheerful nonsense that comes into my head\u2014shall\r\nI?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood, gallant heart!\u201d thought I to myself; but I shook my head, smiling, and\r\nsaid, \u201cNever think of it: impose on yourself no such task. You write to\r\nme!\u2014you\u2019ll not have time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I will find or make time. Good-by!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was gone. The heavy door crashed to: the axe had fallen\u2014the pang was\r\nexperienced.\r\n\n\r\nAllowing myself no time to think or feel\u2014swallowing tears as if they had been\r\nwine\u2014I passed to Madame\u2019s sitting-room to pay the necessary visit of ceremony\r\nand respect. She received me with perfectly well-acted cordiality\u2014was even\r\ndemonstrative, though brief, in her welcome. In ten minutes I was dismissed.\r\nFrom the salle-\u00e0-manger I proceeded to the refectory, where pupils and teachers\r\nwere now assembled for evening study: again I had a welcome, and one not, I\r\nthink, quite hollow. That over, I was free to repair to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd will Graham really write?\u201d I questioned, as I sank tired on the edge of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\n\r\nReason, coming stealthily up to me through the twilight of that long, dim\r\nchamber, whispered sedately\u2014\u201cHe may write once. So kind is his nature, it may\r\nstimulate him for once to make the effort. But it cannot be continued\u2014it\r\nmay not be repeated. Great were that folly which should build on such a\r\npromise\u2014insane that credulity which should mistake the transitory rain-pool,\r\nholding in its hollow one draught, for the perennial spring yielding the supply\r\nof seasons.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI bent my head: I sat thinking an hour longer. Reason still whispered me,\r\nlaying on my shoulder a withered hand, and frostily touching my ear with the\r\nchill blue lips of eld.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf,\u201d muttered she, \u201cif he should write, what then? Do you meditate\r\npleasure in replying? Ah, fool! I warn you! Brief be your answer. Hope no\r\ndelight of heart\u2014no indulgence of intellect: grant no expansion to feeling\u2014give\r\nholiday to no single faculty: dally with no friendly exchange: foster no genial\r\nintercommunion\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I have talked to Graham and you did not chide,\u201d I pleaded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said she, \u201cI needed not. Talk for you is good discipline. You converse\r\nimperfectly. While you speak, there can be no oblivion of inferiority\u2014no\r\nencouragement to delusion: pain, privation, penury stamp your language\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I again broke in, \u201cwhere the bodily presence is weak and the speech\r\ncontemptible, surely there cannot be error in making written language the\r\nmedium of better utterance than faltering lips can achieve?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReason only answered, \u201cAt your peril you cherish that idea, or suffer its\r\ninfluence to animate any writing of yours!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if I feel, may I never express?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d declared Reason.\r\n\n\r\nI groaned under her bitter sternness. Never\u2014never\u2014oh, hard word! This hag, this\r\nReason, would not let me look up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless\r\nI were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her,\r\nI was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and\r\nsteadily through all life to despond. Reason might be right; yet no wonder we\r\nare glad at times to defy her, to rush from under her rod and give a truant\r\nhour to Imagination\u2014her soft, bright foe, our sweet Help, our\r\ndivine Hope. We shall and must break bounds at intervals, despite the terrible\r\nrevenge that awaits our return. Reason is vindictive as a devil: for me she was\r\nalways envenomed as a step-mother. If I have obeyed her it has chiefly been\r\nwith the obedience of fear, not of love. Long ago I should have died of her\r\nill-usage her stint, her chill, her barren board, her icy bed, her savage,\r\nceaseless blows; but for that kinder Power who holds my secret and sworn\r\nallegiance. Often has Reason turned me out by night, in mid-winter, on cold\r\nsnow, flinging for sustenance the gnawed bone dogs had forsaken: sternly has\r\nshe vowed her stores held nothing more for me\u2014harshly denied my right to ask\r\nbetter things\u2026. Then, looking up, have I seen in the sky a head amidst circling\r\nstars, of which the midmost and the brightest lent a ray sympathetic and\r\nattent. A spirit, softer and better than Human Reason, has descended with quiet\r\nflight to the waste\u2014bringing all round her a sphere of air borrowed of eternal\r\nsummer; bringing perfume of flowers which cannot fade\u2014fragrance of trees whose\r\nfruit is life; bringing breezes pure from a world whose day needs no sun to\r\nlighten it. My hunger has this good angel appeased with food, sweet and\r\nstrange, gathered amongst gleaning angels, garnering their dew-white harvest in\r\nthe first fresh hour of a heavenly day; tenderly has she assuaged the\r\ninsufferable fears which weep away life itself\u2014kindly given rest to deadly\r\nweariness\u2014generously lent hope and impulse to paralyzed despair. Divine,\r\ncompassionate, succourable influence! When I bend the knee to other than God,\r\nit shall be at thy white and winged feet, beautiful on mountain or on plain.\r\nTemples have been reared to the Sun\u2014altars dedicated to the Moon. Oh, greater\r\nglory! To thee neither hands build, nor lips consecrate: but hearts, through\r\nages, are faithful to thy worship. A dwelling thou hast, too wide for walls,\r\ntoo high for dome\u2014a temple whose floors are space\u2014rites whose mysteries\r\ntranspire in presence, to the kindling, the harmony of worlds!\r\n\n\r\nSovereign complete! thou hadst, for endurance, thy great army of martyrs; for\r\nachievement, thy chosen band of worthies. Deity unquestioned, thine essence\r\nfoils decay!\r\n\n\r\nThis daughter of Heaven remembered me to-night; she saw me weep, and she came\r\nwith comfort: \u201cSleep,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep, sweetly\u2014I gild thy dreams!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe kept her word, and watched me through a night\u2019s rest; but at dawn Reason\r\nrelieved the guard. I awoke with a sort of start; the rain was dashing against\r\nthe panes, and the wind uttering a peevish cry at intervals; the night-lamp was\r\ndying on the black circular stand in the middle of the dormitory: day had\r\nalready broken. How I pity those whom mental pain stuns instead of rousing!\r\nThis morning the pang of waking snatched me out of bed like a hand with a\r\ngiant\u2019s gripe. How quickly I dressed in the cold of the raw dawn! How deeply I\r\ndrank of the ice-cold water in my carafe! This was always my cordial, to which,\r\nlike other dram-drinkers, I had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin.\r\n\n\r\nEre long the bell rang its r\u00e9veill\u00e9e to the whole school. Being dressed,\r\nI descended alone to the refectory, where the stove was lit and the air was\r\nwarm; through the rest of the house it was cold, with the nipping severity of a\r\ncontinental winter: though now but the beginning of November, a north wind had\r\nthus early brought a wintry blight over Europe: I remember the black stoves\r\npleased me little when I first came; but now I began to associate with them a\r\nsense of comfort, and liked them, as in England we like a fireside.\r\n\n\r\nSitting down before this dark comforter, I presently fell into a deep argument\r\nwith myself on life and its chances, on destiny and her decrees. My mind,\r\ncalmer and stronger now than last night, made for itself some imperious rules,\r\nprohibiting under deadly penalties all weak retrospect of happiness past;\r\ncommanding a patient journeying through the wilderness of the present,\r\nenjoining a reliance on faith\u2014a watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue\r\nwhile they guide, and awe while they illumine\u2014hushing the impulse to fond\r\nidolatry, checking the longing out-look for a far-off promised land whose\r\nrivers are, perhaps, never to be reached save in dying dreams, whose sweet\r\npastures are to be viewed but from the desolate and sepulchral summit of a\r\nNebo.\r\n\n\r\nBy degrees, a composite feeling of blended strength and pain wound itself\r\nwirily round my heart, sustained, or at least restrained, its throbbings, and\r\nmade me fit for the day\u2019s work. I lifted my head.\r\n\n\r\nAs I said before, I was sitting near the stove, let into the wall beneath the\r\nrefectory and the carr\u00e9, and thus sufficing to heat both apartments. Piercing\r\nthe same wall, and close beside the stove, was a window, looking also into the\r\ncarr\u00e9; as I looked up a cap-tassel, a brow, two eyes, filled a pane of that\r\nwindow; the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit right against my own glance: they\r\nwere watching me. I had not till that moment known that tears were on my cheek,\r\nbut I felt them now.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a strange house, where no corner was sacred from intrusion, where not\r\na tear could be shed, nor a thought pondered, but a spy was at hand to note and\r\nto divine. And this new, this out-door, this male spy, what business had\r\nbrought him to the premises at this unwonted hour? What possible right had he\r\nto intrude on me thus? No other professor would have dared to cross the carr\u00e9\r\nbefore the class-bell rang. M. Emanuel took no account of hours nor of claims:\r\nthere was some book of reference in the first-class library which he had\r\noccasion to consult; he had come to seek it: on his way he passed the\r\nrefectory. It was very much his habit to wear eyes before, behind, and on each\r\nside of him: he had seen me through the little window\u2014he now opened the\r\nrefectory door, and there he stood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, vous \u00eates triste.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, j\u2019en ai bien le droit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous \u00eates malade de c\u0153ur et d\u2019humeur,\u201d he pursued. \u201cYou are at once mournful\r\nand mutinous. I see on your cheek two tears which I know are hot as two sparks,\r\nand salt as two crystals of the sea. While I speak you eye me strangely. Shall\r\nI tell you of what I am reminded while watching you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I shall be called away to prayers shortly; my time for conversation\r\nis very scant and brief at this hour\u2014excuse\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI excuse everything,\u201d he interrupted; \u201cmy mood is so meek, neither rebuff nor,\r\nperhaps, insult could ruffle it. You remind me, then, of a young she wild\r\ncreature, new caught, untamed, viewing with a mixture of fire and fear the\r\nfirst entrance of the breaker-in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUnwarrantable accost!\u2014rash and rude if addressed to a pupil; to a teacher\r\ninadmissible. He thought to provoke a warm reply; I had seen him vex the\r\npassionate to explosion before now. In me his malice should find no\r\ngratification; I sat silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look,\u201d said he, \u201clike one who would snatch at a draught of sweet poison,\r\nand spurn wholesome bitters with disgust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I never liked bitters; nor do I believe them wholesome. And to\r\nwhatever is sweet, be it poison or food, you cannot, at least, deny its own\r\ndelicious quality\u2014sweetness. Better, perhaps, to die quickly a pleasant death,\r\nthan drag on long a charmless life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d said he, \u201cyou should take your bitter dose duly and daily, if I had the\r\npower to administer it; and, as to the well-beloved poison, I would, perhaps,\r\nbreak the very cup which held it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sharply turned my head away, partly because his presence utterly displeased\r\nme, and partly because I wished to shun questions: lest, in my present mood,\r\nthe effort of answering should overmaster self-command.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said he, more softly, \u201ctell me the truth\u2014you grieve at being parted\r\nfrom friends\u2014is it not so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe insinuating softness was not more acceptable than the inquisitorial\r\ncuriosity. I was silent. He came into the room, sat down on the bench about two\r\nyards from me, and persevered long, and, for him, patiently, in attempts to\r\ndraw me into conversation\u2014attempts necessarily unavailing, because I\r\ncould not talk. At last I entreated to be let alone. In uttering the\r\nrequest, my voice faltered, my head sank on my arms and the table. I wept\r\nbitterly, though quietly. He sat a while longer. I did not look up nor speak,\r\ntill the closing door and his retreating step told me that he was gone. These\r\ntears proved a relief.\r\n\n\r\nI had time to bathe my eyes before breakfast, and I suppose I appeared at that\r\nmeal as serene as any other person: not, however, quite as jocund-looking as\r\nthe young lady who placed herself in the seat opposite mine, fixed on me a pair\r\nof somewhat small eyes twinkling gleefully, and frankly stretched across the\r\ntable a white hand to be shaken. Miss Fanshawe\u2019s travels, gaieties, and\r\nflirtations agreed with her mightily; she had become quite plump, her cheeks\r\nlooked as round as apples. I had seen her last in elegant evening attire. I\r\ndon\u2019t know that she looked less charming now in her school-dress, a kind of\r\ncareless peignoir of a dark-blue material, dimly and dingily plaided with\r\nblack. I even think this dusky wrapper gave her charms a triumph; enhancing by\r\ncontrast the fairness of her skin, the freshness of her bloom, the golden\r\nbeauty of her tresses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you are come back, Timon,\u201d said she. Timon was one of her dozen\r\nnames for me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how often I have wanted you in this dismal hole.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, have you? Then, of course, if you wanted me, you have something for me to\r\ndo: stockings to mend, perhaps.\u201d I never gave Ginevra a minute\u2019s or a\r\nfarthing\u2019s credit for disinterestedness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCrabbed and crusty as ever!\u201d said she. \u201cI expected as much: it would not be\r\nyou if you did not snub one. But now, come, grand-mother, I hope you like\r\ncoffee as much, and pistolets as little as ever: are you disposed to barter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake your own way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis way consisted in a habit she had of making me convenient. She did not like\r\nthe morning cup of coffee; its school brewage not being strong or sweet enough\r\nto suit her palate; and she had an excellent appetite, like any other healthy\r\nschool-girl, for the morning pistolets or rolls, which were new-baked and very\r\ngood, and of which a certain allowance was served to each. This allowance being\r\nmore than I needed, I gave half to Ginevra; never varying in my preference,\r\nthough many others used to covet the superfluity; and she in return would\r\nsometimes give me a portion of her coffee. This morning I was glad of the\r\ndraught; hunger I had none, and with thirst I was parched. I don\u2019t know why I\r\nchose to give my bread rather to Ginevra than to another; nor why, if two had\r\nto share the convenience of one drinking-vessel, as sometimes happened\u2014for\r\ninstance, when we took a long walk into the country, and halted for refreshment\r\nat a farm\u2014I always contrived that she should be my convive, and rather liked to\r\nlet her take the lion\u2019s share, whether of the white beer, the sweet wine, or\r\nthe new milk: so it was, however, and she knew it; and, therefore, while we\r\nwrangled daily, we were never alienated.\r\n\n\r\nAfter breakfast my custom was to withdraw to the first classe, and sit and\r\nread, or think (oftenest the latter) there alone, till the nine-o\u2019clock bell\r\nthrew open all doors, admitted the gathered rush of externes and\r\ndemi-pensionnaires, and gave the signal for entrance on that bustle and\r\nbusiness to which, till five P.M., there was no relax.\r\n\n\r\nI was just seated this morning, when a tap came to the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon, Mademoiselle,\u201d said a pensionnaire, entering gently; and having taken\r\nfrom her desk some necessary book or paper, she withdrew on tip-toe, murmuring\r\nas she passed me, \u201cQue mademoiselle est appliqu\u00e9e!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAppliqu\u00e9e, indeed! The means of application were spread before me, but I was\r\ndoing nothing; and had done nothing, and meant to do nothing. Thus does the\r\nworld give us credit for merits we have not. Madame Beck herself deemed me a\r\nregular bas-bleu, and often and solemnly used to warn me not to study too much,\r\nlest \u201cthe blood should all go to my head.\u201d Indeed, everybody in the Rue\r\nFossette held a superstition that \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d was learned; with the notable\r\nexception of M. Emanuel, who, by means peculiar to himself, and quite\r\ninscrutable to me, had obtained a not inaccurate inkling of my real\r\nqualifications, and used to take quiet opportunities of chuckling in my ear his\r\nmalign glee over their scant measure. For my part, I never troubled myself\r\nabout this penury. I dearly like to think my own thoughts; I had great pleasure\r\nin reading a few books, but not many: preferring always those on whose style or\r\nsentiment the writer\u2019s individual nature was plainly stamped; flagging\r\ninevitably over characterless books, however clever and meritorious: perceiving\r\nwell that, as far as my own mind was concerned, God had limited its powers and,\r\nits action\u2014thankful, I trust, for the gift bestowed, but unambitious of higher\r\nendowments, not restlessly eager after higher culture.\r\n\n\r\nThe polite pupil was scarcely gone, when, unceremoniously, without tap, in\r\nburst a second intruder. Had I been blind I should have known who this was. A\r\nconstitutional reserve of manner had by this time told with wholesome and, for\r\nme, commodious effect, on the manners of my co-inmates; rarely did I now suffer\r\nfrom rude or intrusive treatment. When I first came, it would happen once and\r\nagain that a blunt German would clap me on the shoulder, and ask me to run a\r\nrace; or a riotous Labassecourienne seize me by the arm and drag me towards the\r\nplayground: urgent proposals to take a swing at the \u201cPas de G\u00e9ant,\u201d or to join\r\nin a certain romping hide-and-seek game called \u201cUn, deux, trois,\u201d were formerly\r\nalso of hourly occurrence; but all these little attentions had ceased some time\r\nago\u2014ceased, too, without my finding it necessary to be at the trouble of\r\npoint-blank cutting them short. I had now no familiar demonstration to dread or\r\nendure, save from one quarter; and as that was English I could bear it. Ginevra\r\nFanshawe made no scruple of\u2014at times\u2014catching me as I was crossing the carr\u00e9,\r\nwhirling me round in a compulsory waltz, and heartily enjoying the mental and\r\nphysical discomfiture her proceeding induced. Ginevra Fanshawe it was who now\r\nbroke in upon \u201cmy learned leisure.\u201d She carried a huge music-book under her\r\narm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo to your practising,\u201d said I to her at once: \u201caway with you to the little\r\nsalon!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot till I have had a talk with you, ch\u00e8re amie. I know where you have been\r\nspending your vacation, and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces,\r\nand enjoying life like any other belle. I saw you at the concert the other\r\nnight, dressed, actually, like anybody else. Who is your tailleuse?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTittle-tattle: how prettily it begins! My tailleuse!\u2014a fiddlestick! Come,\r\nsheer off, Ginevra. I really don\u2019t want your company.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut when I want yours so much, ange farouche, what does a little reluctance on\r\nyour part signify? Dieu merci! we know how to man\u0153uvre with our gifted\r\ncompatriote\u2014the learned \u2018ourse Britannique.\u2019 And so, Ourson, you know Isidore?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know John Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush!\u201d (putting her fingers in her ears) \u201cyou crack my tympanums with your\r\nrude Anglicisms. But, how is our well-beloved John? Do tell me about him. The\r\npoor man must be in a sad way. What did he say to my behaviour the other night?\r\nWasn\u2019t I cruel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you think I noticed you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was a delightful evening. Oh, that divine de Hamal! And then to watch the\r\nother sulking and dying in the distance; and the old lady\u2014my future\r\nmamma-in-law! But I am afraid I and Lady Sara were a little rude in quizzing\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLady Sara never quizzed her at all; and for what you did, don\u2019t make\r\nyourself in the least uneasy: Mrs. Bretton will survive your sneer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe may: old ladies are tough; but that poor son of hers! Do tell me what he\r\nsaid: I saw he was terribly cut up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe said you looked as if at heart you were already Madame de Hamal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he?\u201d she cried with delight. \u201cHe noticed that? How charming! I thought he\r\nwould be mad with jealousy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra, have you seriously done with Dr. Bretton? Do you want him to give you\r\nup?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! you know he can\u2019t do that: but wasn\u2019t he mad?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite mad,\u201d I assented; \u201cas mad as a March hare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and how ever did you get him home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow ever, indeed! Have you no pity on his poor mother and me? Fancy us\r\nholding him tight down in the carriage, and he raving between us, fit to drive\r\neverybody delirious. The very coachman went wrong, somehow, and we lost our\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so? You are laughing at me. Now, Lucy Snowe\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI assure you it is fact\u2014and fact, also, that Dr. Bretton would not stay\r\nin the carriage: he broke from us, and would ride outside.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfterwards\u2014when he did reach home\u2014the scene transcends description.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, but describe it\u2014you know it is such fun!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFun for you, Miss Fanshawe? but\u201d (with stern gravity) \u201cyou know the\r\nproverb\u2014\u2018What is sport to one may be death to another.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo on, there\u2019s a darling Timon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConscientiously, I cannot, unless you assure me you have some heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have\u2014such an immensity, you don\u2019t know!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood! In that case, you will be able to conceive Dr. Graham Bretton rejecting\r\nhis supper in the first instance\u2014the chicken, the sweetbread prepared for his\r\nrefreshment, left on the table untouched. Then\u2014\u2014but it is of no use dwelling at\r\nlength on the harrowing details. Suffice it to say, that never, in the most\r\nstormy fits and moments of his infancy, had his mother such work to tuck the\r\nsheets about him as she had that night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t lie still?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t lie still: there it was. The sheets might be tucked in, but the\r\nthing was to keep them tucked in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay! Can\u2019t you imagine him demanding his divine Ginevra, anathematizing that\r\ndemon, de Hamal\u2014raving about golden locks, blue eyes, white arms, glittering\r\nbracelets?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, did he? He saw the bracelet?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSaw the bracelet? Yes, as plain as I saw it: and, perhaps, for the first time,\r\nhe saw also the brand-mark with which its pressure has encircled your arm.\r\nGinevra\u201d (rising, and changing my tone), \u201ccome, we will have an end of this. Go\r\naway to your practising.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I opened the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you have not told me all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had better not wait until I do tell you all. Such extra\r\ncommunicativeness could give you no pleasure. March!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCross thing!\u201d said she; but she obeyed: and, indeed, the first classe was my\r\nterritory, and she could not there legally resist a notice of quittance from\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\nYet, to speak the truth, never had I been less dissatisfied with her than I was\r\nthen. There was pleasure in thinking of the contrast between the reality and my\r\ndescription\u2014to remember Dr. John enjoying the drive home, eating his supper\r\nwith relish, and retiring to rest with Christian composure. It was only when I\r\nsaw him really unhappy that I felt really vexed with the fair, frail cause of\r\nhis suffering.\r\n\n\r\nA fortnight passed; I was getting once more inured to the harness of school,\r\nand lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of custom. One\r\nafternoon, in crossing the carr\u00e9, on my way to the first classe, where I was\r\nexpected to assist at a lesson of \u201cstyle and literature,\u201d I saw, standing by\r\none of the long and large windows, Rosine, the portress. Her attitude, as\r\nusual, was quite nonchalante. She always \u201cstood at ease;\u201d one of her hands\r\nrested in her apron-pocket, the other at this moment held to her eyes a letter,\r\nwhereof Mademoiselle coolly perused the address, and deliberately studied the\r\nseal.\r\n\n\r\nA letter! The shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in its\r\nvery core for seven days past. I had dreamed of a letter last night. Strong\r\nmagnetism drew me to that letter now; yet, whether I should have ventured to\r\ndemand of Rosine so much as a glance at that white envelope, with the spot of\r\nred wax in the middle, I know not. No; I think I should have sneaked past in\r\nterror of a rebuff from Disappointment: my heart throbbed now as if I already\r\nheard the tramp of her approach. Nervous mistake! It was the rapid step of the\r\nProfessor of Literature measuring the corridor. I fled before him. Could I but\r\nbe seated quietly at my desk before his arrival, with the class under my orders\r\nall in disciplined readiness, he would, perhaps, exempt me from notice; but, if\r\ncaught lingering in the carr\u00e9, I should be sure to come in for a special\r\nharangue. I had time to get seated, to enforce perfect silence, to take out my\r\nwork, and to commence it amidst the profoundest and best trained hush, ere M.\r\nEmanuel entered with his vehement burst of latch and panel, and his deep,\r\nredundant bow, prophetic of choler.\r\n\n\r\nAs usual he broke upon us like a clap of thunder; but instead of flashing\r\nlightning-wise from the door to the estrade, his career halted midway at my\r\ndesk. Setting his face towards me and the window, his back to the pupils and\r\nthe room, he gave me a look\u2014such a look as might have licensed me to stand\r\nstraight up and demand what he meant\u2014a look of scowling distrust.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0! pour vous,\u201d said he, drawing his hand from his waist-coat, and placing\r\non my desk a letter\u2014the very letter I had seen in Rosine\u2019s hand\u2014the letter\r\nwhose face of enamelled white and single Cyclop\u2019s-eye of vermilion-red had\r\nprinted themselves so clear and perfect on the retina of an inward vision. I\r\nknew it, I felt it to be the letter of my hope, the fruition of my wish, the\r\nrelease from my doubt, the ransom from my terror. This letter M. Paul, with his\r\nunwarrantably interfering habits, had taken from the portress, and now\r\ndelivered it himself.\r\n\n\r\nI might have been angry, but had not a second for the sensation. Yes: I held in\r\nmy hand not a slight note, but an envelope, which must, at least, contain a\r\nsheet: it felt not flimsy, but firm, substantial, satisfying. And here was the\r\ndirection, \u201cMiss Lucy Snowe,\u201d in a clean, clear, equal, decided hand; and here\r\nwas the seal, round, full, deftly dropped by untremulous fingers, stamped with\r\nthe well-cut impress of initials, \u201cJ. G. B.\u201d I experienced a happy feeling\u2014a\r\nglad emotion which went warm to my heart, and ran lively through all my veins.\r\nFor once a hope was realized. I held in my hand a morsel of real solid joy: not\r\na dream, not an image of the brain, not one of those shadowy chances\r\nimagination pictures, and on which humanity starves but cannot live; not a mess\r\nof that manna I drearily eulogized awhile ago\u2014which, indeed, at first melts on\r\nthe lips with an unspeakable and preternatural sweetness, but which, in the\r\nend, our souls full surely loathe; longing deliriously for natural and\r\nearth-grown food, wildly praying Heaven\u2019s Spirits to reclaim their own\r\nspirit-dew and essence\u2014an aliment divine, but for mortals deadly. It was\r\nneither sweet hail nor small coriander-seed\u2014neither slight wafer, nor luscious\r\nhoney, I had lighted on; it was the wild, savoury mess of the hunter,\r\nnourishing and salubrious meat, forest-fed or desert-reared, fresh, healthful,\r\nand life-sustaining. It was what the old dying patriarch demanded of his son\r\nEsau, promising in requital the blessing of his last breath. It was a godsend;\r\nand I inwardly thanked the God who had vouchsafed it. Outwardly I only thanked\r\nman, crying, \u201cThank you, thank you, Monsieur!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMonsieur curled his lip, gave me a vicious glance of the eye, and strode to his\r\nestrade. M. Paul was not at all a good little man, though he had good points.\r\n\n\r\nDid I read my letter there and then? Did I consume the venison at once and with\r\nhaste, as if Esau\u2019s shaft flew every day?\r\n\n\r\nI knew better. The cover with its address\u2014the seal, with its three clear\r\nletters\u2014was bounty and abundance for the present. I stole from the room, I\r\nprocured the key of the great dormitory, which was kept locked by day. I went\r\nto my bureau; with a sort of haste and trembling lest Madame should creep\r\nup-stairs and spy me, I opened a drawer, unlocked a box, and took out a case,\r\nand\u2014having feasted my eyes with one more look, and approached the seal with a\r\nmixture of awe and shame and delight, to my lips\u2014I folded the untasted\r\ntreasure, yet all fair and inviolate, in silver paper, committed it to the\r\ncase, shut up box and drawer, reclosed, relocked the dormitory, and returned to\r\nclass, feeling as if fairy tales were true, and fairy gifts no dream. Strange,\r\nsweet insanity! And this letter, the source of my joy, I had not yet read: did\r\nnot yet know the number of its lines.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I re-entered the schoolroom, behold M. Paul raging like a pestilence! Some\r\npupil had not spoken audibly or distinctly enough to suit his ear and taste,\r\nand now she and others were weeping, and he was raving from his estrade, almost\r\nlivid. Curious to mention, as I appeared, he fell on me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas I the mistress of these girls? Did I profess to teach them the conduct\r\nbefitting ladies?\u2014and did I permit and, he doubted not, encourage them to\r\nstrangle their mother-tongue in their throats, to mince and mash it between\r\ntheir teeth, as if they had some base cause to be ashamed of the words they\r\nuttered? Was this modesty? He knew better. It was a vile pseudo sentiment\u2014the\r\noffspring or the forerunner of evil. Rather than submit to this mopping and\r\nmowing, this mincing and grimacing, this, grinding of a noble tongue, this\r\ngeneral affectation and sickening stubbornness of the pupils of the first\r\nclass, he would throw them up for a set of insupportable petites ma\u00eetresses,\r\nand confine himself to teaching the ABC to the babies of the third division.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat could I say to all this? Really nothing; and I hoped he would allow me to\r\nbe silent. The storm recommenced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEvery answer to his queries was then refused? It seemed to be considered in\r\nthat place\u2014that conceited boudoir of a first classe, with its\r\npretentious book-cases, its green-baized desks, its rubbish of flower-stands,\r\nits trash of framed pictures and maps, and its foreign surveillante,\r\nforsooth!\u2014it seemed to be the fashion to think there that the Professor\r\nof Literature was not worthy of a reply! These were new ideas; imported, he did\r\nnot doubt, straight from \u2018la Grande Bretagne:\u2019 they savoured of island\r\ninsolence and arrogance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nLull the second\u2014the girls, not one of whom was ever known to weep a tear for\r\nthe rebukes of any other master, now all melting like snow-statues before the\r\nintemperate heat of M. Emanuel: I not yet much shaken, sitting down, and\r\nventuring to resume my work.\r\n\n\r\nSomething\u2014either in my continued silence or in the movement of my hand,\r\nstitching\u2014transported M. Emanuel beyond the last boundary of patience; he\r\nactually sprang from his estrade. The stove stood near my desk, he attacked it;\r\nthe little iron door was nearly dashed from its hinges, the fuel was made to\r\nfly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce que vous avez l\u2019intention de m\u2019insulter?\u201d said he to me, in a low,\r\nfurious voice, as he thus outraged, under pretence of arranging the fire.\r\n\n\r\nIt was time to soothe him a little if possible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur,\u201d said I, \u201cI would not insult you for the world. I remember too\r\nwell that you once said we should be friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not intend my voice to falter, but it did: more, I think, through the\r\nagitation of late delight than in any spasm of present fear. Still there\r\ncertainly was something in M. Paul\u2019s anger\u2014a kind of passion of emotion\u2014that\r\nspecially tended to draw tears. I was not unhappy, nor much afraid, yet I wept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAllons, allons!\u201d said he presently, looking round and seeing the deluge\r\nuniversal. \u201cDecidedly I am a monster and a ruffian. I have only one\r\npocket-handkerchief,\u201d he added, \u201cbut if I had twenty, I would offer you each\r\none. Your teacher shall be your representative. Here, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he took forth and held out to me a clean silk handkerchief. Now a person\r\nwho did not know M. Paul, who was unused to him and his impulses, would\r\nnaturally have bungled at this offer\u2014declined accepting the same\u2014et cetera. But\r\nI too plainly felt this would never do: the slightest hesitation would have\r\nbeen fatal to the incipient treaty of peace. I rose and met the handkerchief\r\nhalf-way, received it with decorum, wiped therewith my eyes, and, resuming my\r\nseat, and retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on my lap, took especial\r\ncare during the remainder of the lesson to touch neither needle nor thimble,\r\nscissors nor muslin. Many a jealous glance did M. Paul cast at these\r\nimplements; he hated them mortally, considering sewing a source of distraction\r\nfrom the attention due to himself. A very eloquent lesson he gave, and very\r\nkind and friendly was he to the close. Ere he had done, the clouds were\r\ndispersed and the sun shining out\u2014tears were exchanged for smiles.\r\n\n\r\nIn quitting the room he paused once more at my desk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your letter?\u201d said he, this time not quite fiercely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not yet read it, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! it is too good to read at once; you save it, as, when I was a boy, I used\r\nto save a peach whose bloom was very ripe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe guess came so near the truth, I could not prevent a suddenly-rising warmth\r\nin my face from revealing as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou promise yourself a pleasant moment,\u201d said he, \u201cin reading that letter; you\r\nwill open it when alone\u2014n\u2019est-ce pas? Ah! a smile answers. Well, well! one\r\nshould not be too harsh; \u2018la jeunesse n\u2019a qu\u2019un temps.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, Monsieur!\u201d I cried, or rather whispered after him, as he turned to\r\ngo, \u201cdo not leave me under a mistake. This is merely a friend\u2019s letter. Without\r\nreading it, I can vouch for that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe con\u00e7ois, je con\u00e7ois: on sait ce que c\u2019est qu\u2019un ami. Bonjour,\r\nMademoiselle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Monsieur, here is your handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep it, keep it, till the letter is read, then bring it me; I shall read the\r\nbillet\u2019s tenor in your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen he was gone, the pupils having already poured out of the schoolroom into\r\nthe berceau, and thence into the garden and court to take their customary\r\nrecreation before the five-o\u2019clock dinner, I stood a moment thinking, and\r\nabsently twisting the handkerchief round my arm. For some reason\u2014gladdened, I\r\nthink, by a sudden return of the golden glimmer of childhood, roused by an\r\nunwonted renewal of its buoyancy, made merry by the liberty of the closing\r\nhour, and, above all, solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that\r\ntreasure in the case, box, drawer up-stairs,\u2014I fell to playing with the\r\nhandkerchief as if it were a ball, casting it into the air and catching it\u2014as\r\nit fell. The game was stopped by another hand than mine\u2014a hand emerging from a\r\npalet\u00f4t-sleeve and stretched over my shoulder; it caught the extemporised\r\nplaything and bore it away with these sullen words:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes effets.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReally that little man was dreadful: a mere sprite of caprice and, ubiquity:\r\none never knew either his whim or his whereabout.\r\n\n"}
{"23": "\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE LETTER.\n\r\nWhen all was still in the house; when dinner was over and the noisy\r\nrecreation-hour past; when darkness had set in, and the quiet lamp of study was\r\nlit in the refectory; when the externes were gone home, the clashing door and\r\nclamorous bell hushed for the evening; when Madame was safely settled in the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger in company with her mother and some friends; I then glided to\r\nthe kitchen, begged a bougie for one half-hour for a particular occasion, found\r\nacceptance of my petition at the hands of my friend Goton, who answered, \u201cMais\r\ncertainement, chou-chou, vous en aurez deux, si vous voulez;\u201d and, light in\r\nhand, I mounted noiseless to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\nGreat was my chagrin to find in that apartment a pupil gone to bed\r\nindisposed,\u2014greater when I recognised, amid the muslin nightcap borders, the\r\n\u201cfigure chiffonn\u00e9e\u201d of Mistress Ginevra Fanshawe; supine at this moment, it is\r\ntrue\u2014but certain to wake and overwhelm me with chatter when the interruption\r\nwould be least acceptable: indeed, as I watched her, a slight twinkling of the\r\neyelids warned me that the present appearance of repose might be but a ruse,\r\nassumed to cover sly vigilance over \u201cTimon\u2019s\u201d movements; she was not to be\r\ntrusted. And I had so wished to be alone, just to read my precious letter in\r\npeace.\r\n\n\r\nWell, I must go to the classes. Having sought and found my prize in its casket,\r\nI descended. Ill-luck pursued me. The classes were undergoing sweeping and\r\npurification by candle-light, according to hebdomadal custom: benches were\r\npiled on desks, the air was dim with dust, damp coffee-grounds (used by\r\nLabassecourien housemaids instead of tea-leaves) darkened the floor; all was\r\nhopeless confusion. Baffled, but not beaten, I withdrew, bent as resolutely as\r\never on finding solitude somewhere.\r\n\n\r\nTaking a key whereof I knew the repository, I mounted three staircases in\r\nsuccession, reached a dark, narrow, silent landing, opened a worm-eaten door,\r\nand dived into the deep, black, cold garret. Here none would follow me\u2014none\r\ninterrupt\u2014not Madame herself. I shut the garret-door; I placed my light on a\r\ndoddered and mouldy chest of drawers; I put on a shawl, for the air was\r\nice-cold; I took my letter; trembling with sweet impatience, I broke its seal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill it be long\u2014will it be short?\u201d thought I, passing my hand across my eyes\r\nto dissipate the silvery dimness of a suave, south-wind shower.\r\n\n\r\nIt was long.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill it be cool?\u2014will it be kind?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was kind.\r\n\n\r\nTo my checked, bridled, disciplined expectation, it seemed very kind: to my\r\nlonging and famished thought it seemed, perhaps, kinder than it was.\r\n\n\r\nSo little had I hoped, so much had I feared; there was a fulness of delight in\r\nthis taste of fruition\u2014such, perhaps, as many a human being passes through life\r\nwithout ever knowing. The poor English teacher in the frosty garret, reading by\r\na dim candle guttering in the wintry air, a letter simply good-natured\u2014nothing\r\nmore; though that good-nature then seemed to me godlike\u2014was happier than most\r\nqueens in palaces.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, happiness of such shallow origin could be but brief; yet, while it\r\nlasted it was genuine and exquisite: a bubble\u2014but a sweet bubble\u2014of real\r\nhoney-dew. Dr. John had written to me at length; he had written to me with\r\npleasure; he had written with benignant mood, dwelling with sunny satisfaction\r\non scenes that had passed before his eyes and mine,\u2014on places we had visited\r\ntogether\u2014on conversations we had held\u2014on all the little subject-matter, in\r\nshort, of the last few halcyon weeks. But the cordial core of the delight was,\r\na conviction the blithe, genial language generously imparted, that it had been\r\npoured out not merely to content me\u2014but to gratify himself. A\r\ngratification he might never more desire, never more seek\u2014an hypothesis in\r\nevery point of view approaching the certain; but that concerned the\r\nfuture. This present moment had no pain, no blot, no want; full, pure, perfect,\r\nit deeply blessed me. A passing seraph seemed to have rested beside me, leaned\r\ntowards my heart, and reposed on its throb a softening, cooling, healing,\r\nhallowing wing. Dr. John, you pained me afterwards: forgiven be every\r\nill\u2014freely forgiven\u2014for the sake of that one dear remembered good!\r\n\n\r\nAre there wicked things, not human, which envy human bliss? Are there evil\r\ninfluences haunting the air, and poisoning it for man? What was near me?\r\n\n\r\nSomething in that vast solitary garret sounded strangely. Most surely and\r\ncertainly I heard, as it seemed, a stealthy foot on that floor: a sort of\r\ngliding out from the direction of the black recess haunted by the malefactor\r\ncloaks. I turned: my light was dim; the room was long\u2014but as I live! I saw in\r\nthe middle of that ghostly chamber a figure all black and white; the skirts\r\nstraight, narrow, black; the head bandaged, veiled, white.\r\n\n\r\nSay what you will, reader\u2014tell me I was nervous or mad; affirm that I was\r\nunsettled by the excitement of that letter; declare that I dreamed; this I\r\nvow\u2014I saw there\u2014in that room\u2014on that night\u2014an image like\u2014a NUN.\r\n\n\r\nI cried out; I sickened. Had the shape approached me I might have swooned. It\r\nreceded: I made for the door. How I descended all the stairs I know not. By\r\ninstinct I shunned the refectory, and shaped my course to Madame\u2019s\r\nsitting-room: I burst in. I said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in the grenier; I have been there: I saw something. Go and\r\nlook at it, all of you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, \u201cAll of you;\u201d for the room seemed to me full of people, though in truth\r\nthere were but four present: Madame Beck; her mother, Madame Kint, who was out\r\nof health, and now staying with her on a visit; her brother, M. Victor Kint,\r\nand another gentleman, who, when I entered the room, was conversing with the\r\nold lady, and had his back towards the door.\r\n\n\r\nMy mortal fear and faintness must have made me deadly pale. I felt cold and\r\nshaking. They all rose in consternation; they surrounded me. I urged them to go\r\nto the grenier; the sight of the gentlemen did me good and gave me courage: it\r\nseemed as if there were some help and hope, with men at hand. I turned to the\r\ndoor, beckoning them to follow. They wanted to stop me, but I said they must\r\ncome this way: they must see what I had seen\u2014something strange, standing in the\r\nmiddle of the garret. And, now, I remembered my letter, left on the drawers\r\nwith the light. This precious letter! Flesh or spirit must be defied for its\r\nsake. I flew up-stairs, hastening the faster as I knew I was followed: they\r\nwere obliged to come.\r\n\n\r\nLo! when I reached the garret-door, all within was dark as a pit: the light was\r\nout. Happily some one\u2014Madame, I think, with her usual calm sense\u2014had brought a\r\nlamp from the room; speedily, therefore, as they came up, a ray pierced the\r\nopaque blackness. There stood the bougie quenched on the drawers; but where was\r\nthe letter? And I looked for that now, and not for the nun.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy letter! my letter!\u201d I panted and plained, almost beside myself. I groped on\r\nthe floor, wringing my hands wildly. Cruel, cruel doom! To have my bit of\r\ncomfort preternaturally snatched from me, ere I had well tasted its virtue!\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what the others were doing; I could not watch them: they asked me\r\nquestions I did not answer; they ransacked all corners; they prattled about\r\nthis and that disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or crack in the sky-light\u2014I\r\nknow not what. \u201cSomething or somebody has been here,\u201d was sagely averred.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! they have taken my letter!\u201d cried the grovelling, groping, monomaniac.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?\u201d asked a known voice in my ear.\r\nCould I believe that ear? No: and I looked up. Could I trust my eyes? Had I\r\nrecognised the tone? Did I now look on the face of the writer of that very\r\nletter? Was this gentleman near me in this dim garret, John Graham\u2014Dr. Bretton\r\nhimself?\r\n\n\r\nYes: it was. He had been called in that very evening to prescribe for some\r\naccess of illness in old Madame Kint; he was the second gentleman present in\r\nthe salle-\u00e0-manger when I entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it my letter, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour own: yours\u2014the letter you wrote to me. I had come here to read it\r\nquietly. I could not find another spot where it was possible to have it to\r\nmyself. I had saved it all day\u2014never opened it till this evening: it was\r\nscarcely glanced over: I cannot bear to lose it. Oh, my letter!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush! don\u2019t cry and distress yourself so cruelly. What is it worth? Hush! Come\r\nout of this cold room; they are going to send for the police now to examine\r\nfurther: we need not stay here\u2014come, we will go down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA warm hand, taking my cold fingers, led me down to a room where there was a\r\nfire. Dr. John and I sat before the stove. He talked to me and soothed me with\r\nunutterable goodness, promising me twenty letters for the one lost. If there\r\nare words and wrongs like knives, whose deep-inflicted lacerations never\r\nheal\u2014cutting injuries and insults of serrated and poison-dripping edge\u2014so, too,\r\nthere are consolations of tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever to\r\nretain their echo: caressing kindnesses\u2014loved, lingered over through a whole\r\nlife, recalled with unfaded tenderness, and answering the call with undimmed\r\nshine, out of that raven cloud foreshadowing Death himself. I have been told\r\nsince that Dr. Bretton was not nearly so perfect as I thought him: that his\r\nactual character lacked the depth, height, compass, and endurance it possessed\r\nin my creed. I don\u2019t know: he was as good to me as the well is to the parched\r\nwayfarer\u2014as the sun to the shivering jailbird. I remember him heroic. Heroic at\r\nthis moment will I hold him to be.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked me, smiling, why I cared for his letter so very much. I thought, but\r\ndid not say, that I prized it like the blood in my veins. I only answered that\r\nI had so few letters to care for.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure you did not read it,\u201d said he; \u201cor you would think nothing of it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read it, but only once. I want to read it again. I am sorry it is lost.\u201d And\r\nI could not help weeping afresh.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, Lucy, my poor little god-sister (if there be such a relationship),\r\nhere\u2014here is your letter. Why is it not better worth such tears, and\r\nsuch tenderly exaggerating faith?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nCurious, characteristic man\u0153uvre! His quick eye had seen the letter on the\r\nfloor where I sought it; his hand, as quick, had snatched it up. He had hidden\r\nit in his waistcoat pocket. If my trouble had wrought with a whit less stress\r\nand reality, I doubt whether he would ever have acknowledged or restored it.\r\nTears of temperature one degree cooler than those I shed would only have amused\r\nDr. John.\r\n\n\r\nPleasure at regaining made me forget merited reproach for the teasing torment;\r\nmy joy was great; it could not be concealed: yet I think it broke out more in\r\ncountenance than language. I said little.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d asked Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I was\u2014satisfied and happy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d he proceeded, \u201chow do you feel physically? Are you growing calmer?\r\nNot much: for you tremble like a leaf still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed to me, however, that I was sufficiently calm: at least I felt no\r\nlonger terrified. I expressed myself composed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are able, consequently, to tell me what you saw? Your account was quite\r\nvague, do you know? You looked white as the wall; but you only spoke of\r\n\u2018something,\u2019 not defining what. Was it a man? Was it an animal? What was\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never will tell exactly what I saw,\u201d said I, \u201cunless some one else sees it\r\ntoo, and then I will give corroborative testimony; but otherwise, I shall be\r\ndiscredited and accused of dreaming.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said Dr. Bretton; \u201cI will hear it in my professional character: I\r\nlook on you now from a professional point of view, and I read, perhaps, all you\r\nwould conceal\u2014in your eye, which is curiously vivid and restless: in your\r\ncheek, which the blood has forsaken; in your hand, which you cannot steady.\r\nCome, Lucy, speak and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would laugh\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me you shall have no more letters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are laughing now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will again take away that single epistle: being mine, I think I have a right\r\nto reclaim it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt raillery in his words: it made me grave and quiet; but I folded up the\r\nletter and covered it from sight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may hide it, but I can possess it any moment I choose. You don\u2019t know my\r\nskill in sleight of hand; I might practise as a conjuror if I liked. Mamma says\r\nsometimes, too, that I have a harmonizing property of tongue and eye; but you\r\nnever saw that in me\u2014did you, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed\u2014indeed\u2014when you were a mere boy I used to see both: far more then than\r\nnow\u2014for now you are strong, and strength dispenses with subtlety. But\r\nstill,\u2014Dr. John, you have what they call in this country \u2018un air fin,\u2019 that\r\nnobody can mistake. Madame Beck saw it, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd liked it,\u201d said he, laughing, \u201cbecause she has it herself. But, Lucy, give\r\nme that letter\u2014you don\u2019t really care for it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo this provocative speech I made no answer. Graham in mirthful mood must not\r\nbe humoured too far. Just now there was a new sort of smile playing about his\r\nlips\u2014very sweet, but it grieved me somehow\u2014a new sort of light sparkling in his\r\neyes: not hostile, but not reassuring. I rose to go\u2014I bid him good-night a\r\nlittle sadly.\r\n\n\r\nHis sensitiveness\u2014that peculiar, apprehensive, detective faculty of his\u2014felt in\r\na moment the unspoken complaint\u2014the scarce-thought reproach. He asked quietly\r\nif I was offended. I shook my head as implying a negative.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me, then, to speak a little seriously to you before you go. You are in\r\na highly nervous state. I feel sure from what is apparent in your look and\r\nmanner, however well controlled, that whilst alone this evening in that dismal,\r\nperishing sepulchral garret\u2014that dungeon under the leads, smelling of damp and\r\nmould, rank with phthisis and catarrh: a place you never ought to enter\u2014that\r\nyou saw, or thought you saw, some appearance peculiarly calculated to\r\nimpress the imagination. I know that you are not, nor ever were, subject\r\nto material terrors, fears of robbers, &c.\u2014I am not so sure that a\r\nvisitation, bearing a spectral character, would not shake your very mind. Be\r\ncalm now. This is all a matter of the nerves, I see: but just specify the\r\nvision.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell nobody?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNobody\u2014most certainly. You may trust me as implicitly as you did P\u00e8re Silas.\r\nIndeed, the doctor is perhaps the safer confessor of the two, though he has not\r\ngrey hair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not laugh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I may, to do you good: but not in scorn. Lucy, I feel as a friend\r\ntowards you, though your timid nature is slow to trust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now looked like a friend: that indescribable smile and sparkle were gone;\r\nthose formidable arched curves of lip, nostril, eyebrow, were depressed; repose\r\nmarked his attitude\u2014attention sobered his aspect. Won to confidence, I told him\r\nexactly what I had seen: ere now I had narrated to him the legend of the\r\nhouse\u2014whiling away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild October\r\nafternoon, when he and I rode through Bois l\u2019Etang.\r\n\n\r\nHe sat and thought, and while he thought, we heard them all coming down-stairs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre they going to interrupt?\u201d said he, glancing at the door with an annoyed\r\nexpression.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey will not come here,\u201d I answered; for we were in the little salon where\r\nMadame never sat in the evening, and where it was by mere chance that heat was\r\nstill lingering in the stove. They passed the door and went on to the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he pursued, \u201cthey will talk about thieves, burglars, and so on: let them\r\ndo so\u2014mind you say nothing, and keep your resolution of describing your nun to\r\nnobody. She may appear to you again: don\u2019t start.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think then,\u201d I said, with secret horror, \u201cshe came out of my brain, and is\r\nnow gone in there, and may glide out again at an hour and a day when I look not\r\nfor her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think it a case of spectral illusion: I fear, following on and resulting\r\nfrom long-continued mental conflict.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Doctor John\u2014I shudder at the thought of being liable to such an illusion!\r\nIt seemed so real. Is there no cure?\u2014no preventive?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHappiness is the cure\u2014a cheerful mind the preventive: cultivate both.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to\r\ncultivate happiness. What does such advice mean? Happiness is not a\r\npotato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory\r\nshining far down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on\r\ncertain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom\r\nand golden fruitage of Paradise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCultivate happiness!\u201d I said briefly to the doctor: \u201cdo you cultivate\r\nhappiness? How do you manage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a cheerful fellow by nature: and then ill-luck has never dogged me.\r\nAdversity gave me and my mother one passing scowl and brush, but we defied her,\r\nor rather laughed at her, and she went by.\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no cultivation in all this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not give way to melancholy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: I have seen you subdued by that feeling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout Ginevra Fanshawe\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid she not sometimes make you miserable?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh! stuff! nonsense! You see I am better now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIf a laughing eye with a lively light, and a face bright with beaming and\r\nhealthy energy, could attest that he was better, better he certainly was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not look much amiss, or greatly out of condition,\u201d I allowed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why, Lucy, can\u2019t you look and feel as I do\u2014buoyant, courageous, and fit to\r\ndefy all the nuns and flirts in Christendom? I would give gold on the spot just\r\nto see you snap your fingers. Try the man\u0153uvre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to bring Miss Fanshawe into your presence just now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI vow, Lucy, she should not move me: or, she should move me but by one\r\nthing\u2014true, yes, and passionate love. I would accord forgiveness at no less a\r\nprice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! a smile of hers would have been a fortune to you a while since.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTransformed, Lucy: transformed! Remember, you once called me a slave! but I am\r\na free man now!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stood up: in the port of his head, the carriage of his figure, in his\r\nbeaming eye and mien, there revealed itself a liberty which was more than\r\nease\u2014a mood which was disdain of his past bondage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Fanshawe,\u201d he pursued, \u201chas led me through a phase of feeling which is\r\nover: I have entered another condition, and am now much disposed to exact love\r\nfor love\u2014passion for passion\u2014and good measure of it, too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, Doctor! Doctor! you said it was your nature to pursue Love under\r\ndifficulties\u2014to be charmed by a proud insensibility!\u201d.\r\n\n\r\nHe laughed, and answered, \u201cMy nature varies: the mood of one hour is sometimes\r\nthe mockery of the next. Well, Lucy\u201d (drawing on his gloves), \u201cwill the Nun\r\ncome again to-night, think you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive her my compliments, if she does\u2014Dr. John\u2019s compliments\u2014and entreat her to\r\nhave the goodness to wait a visit from him. Lucy, was she a pretty nun? Had she\r\na pretty face? You have not told me that yet; and that is the really\r\nimportant point.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe had a white cloth over her face,\u201d said I, \u201cbut her eyes glittered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConfusion to her goblin trappings!\u201d cried he, irreverently: \u201cbut at least she\r\nhad handsome eyes\u2014bright and soft.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCold and fixed,\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, we\u2019ll none of her: she shall not haunt you, Lucy. Give her that shake\r\nof the hand, if she comes again. Will she stand that, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought it too kind and cordial for a ghost to stand: and so was the smile\r\nwhich matched it, and accompanied his \u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd had there been anything in the garret? What did they discover? I believe,\r\non the closest examination, their discoveries amounted to very little. They\r\ntalked, at first, of the cloaks being disturbed; but Madame Beck told me\r\nafterwards she thought they hung much as usual: and as for the broken pane in\r\nthe skylight, she affirmed that aperture was rarely without one or more panes\r\nbroken or cracked: and besides, a heavy hail-storm had fallen a few days ago.\r\nMadame questioned me very closely as to what I had seen, but I only described\r\nan obscure figure clothed in black: I took care not to breathe the word \u201cnun,\u201d\r\ncertain that this word would at once suggest to her mind an idea of romance and\r\nunreality. She charged me to say nothing on the subject to any servant, pupil,\r\nor teacher, and highly commended my discretion in coming to her private\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger, instead of carrying the tale of horror to the school refectory.\r\nThus the subject dropped. I was left secretly and sadly to wonder, in my own\r\nmind, whether that strange thing was of this world, or of a realm beyond the\r\ngrave; or whether indeed it was only the child of malady, and I of that malady\r\nthe prey.\r\n\n"}
{"24": "\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nVASHTI.\n\r\nTo wonder sadly, did I say? No: a new influence began to act upon my life, and\r\nsadness, for a certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a dell, deep-hollowed\r\nin forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its turf is dank, its herbage\r\npale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a wide gap amongst the oak-trees; the\r\nbreeze sweeps in; the sun looks down; the sad, cold dell becomes a deep cup of\r\nlustre; high summer pours her blue glory and her golden light out of that\r\nbeauteous sky, which till now the starved hollow never saw.\r\n\n\r\nA new creed became mine\u2014a belief in happiness.\r\n\n\r\nIt was three weeks since the adventure of the garret, and I possessed in that\r\ncase, box, drawer up-stairs, casketed with that first letter, four companions\r\nlike to it, traced by the same firm pen, sealed with the same clear seal, full\r\nof the same vital comfort. Vital comfort it seemed to me then: I read them in\r\nafter years; they were kind letters enough\u2014pleasing letters, because composed\r\nby one well pleased; in the two last there were three or four closing lines\r\nhalf-gay, half-tender, \u201cby feeling touched, but not subdued.\u201d Time, dear\r\nreader, mellowed them to a beverage of this mild quality; but when I first\r\ntasted their elixir, fresh from the fount so honoured, it seemed juice of a\r\ndivine vintage: a draught which Hebe might fill, and the very gods approve.\r\n\n\r\nDoes the reader, remembering what was said some pages back, care to ask how I\r\nanswered these letters: whether under the dry, stinting check of Reason, or\r\naccording to the full, liberal impulse of Feeling?\r\n\n\r\nTo speak truth, I compromised matters; I served two masters: I bowed down in\r\nthe houses of Rimmon, and lifted the heart at another shrine. I wrote to these\r\nletters two answers\u2014one for my own relief, the other for Graham\u2019s perusal.\r\n\n\r\nTo begin with: Feeling and I turned Reason out of doors, drew against her bar\r\nand bolt, then we sat down, spread our paper, dipped in the ink an eager pen,\r\nand, with deep enjoyment, poured out our sincere heart. When we had done\u2014when\r\ntwo sheets were covered with the language of a strongly-adherent affection, a\r\nrooted and active gratitude\u2014(once, for all, in this parenthesis, I disclaim,\r\nwith the utmost scorn, every sneaking suspicion of what are called \u201cwarmer\r\nfeelings:\u201d women do not entertain these \u201cwarmer feelings\u201d where, from the\r\ncommencement, through the whole progress of an acquaintance, they have never\r\nonce been cheated of the conviction that, to do so would be to commit a mortal\r\nabsurdity: nobody ever launches into Love unless he has seen or dreamed the\r\nrising of Hope\u2019s star over Love\u2019s troubled waters)\u2014when, then, I had given\r\nexpression to a closely-clinging and deeply-honouring attachment\u2014an attachment\r\nthat wanted to attract to itself and take to its own lot all that was painful\r\nin the destiny of its object; that would, if it could, have absorbed and\r\nconducted away all storms and lightnings from an existence viewed with a\r\npassion of solicitude\u2014then, just at that moment, the doors of my heart would\r\nshake, bolt and bar would yield, Reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful,\r\nsnatch the full sheets, read, sneer, erase, tear up, re-write, fold, seal,\r\ndirect, and send a terse, curt missive of a page. She did right.\r\n\n\r\nI did not live on letters only: I was visited, I was looked after; once a week\r\nI was taken out to La Terrasse; always I was made much of. Dr. Bretton failed\r\nnot to tell me why he was so kind: \u201cTo keep away the nun,\u201d he said; \u201che\r\nwas determined to dispute with her her prey. He had taken,\u201d he declared, \u201ca\r\nthorough dislike to her, chiefly on account of that white face-cloth, and those\r\ncold grey eyes: the moment he heard of those odious particulars,\u201d he affirmed,\r\n\u201cconsummate disgust had incited him to oppose her; he was determined to try\r\nwhether he or she was the cleverest, and he only wished she would once more\r\nlook in upon me when he was present:\u201d but that she never did. In short,\r\nhe regarded me scientifically in the light of a patient, and at once exercised\r\nhis professional skill, and gratified his natural benevolence, by a course of\r\ncordial and attentive treatment.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, the first in December, I was walking by myself in the carr\u00e9; it\r\nwas six o\u2019clock; the classe-doors were closed; but within, the pupils, rampant\r\nin the licence of evening recreation, were counterfeiting a miniature chaos.\r\nThe carr\u00e9 was quite dark, except a red light shining under and about the stove;\r\nthe wide glass-doors and the long windows were frosted over; a crystal sparkle\r\nof starlight, here and there spangling this blanched winter veil, and breaking\r\nwith scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery, proved it a clear\r\nnight, though moonless. That I should dare to remain thus alone in darkness,\r\nshowed that my nerves were regaining a healthy tone: I thought of the nun, but\r\nhardly feared her; though the staircase was behind me, leading up, through\r\nblind, black night, from landing to landing, to the haunted grenier. Yet I own\r\nmy heart quaked, my pulse leaped, when I suddenly heard breathing and rustling,\r\nand turning, saw in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper shadow still\u2014a shape\r\nthat moved and descended. It paused a while at the classe-door, and then it\r\nglided before me. Simultaneously came a clangor of the distant door-bell.\r\nLife-like sounds bring life-like feelings: this shape was too round and low for\r\nmy gaunt nun: it was only Madame Beck on duty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle Lucy!\u201d cried Rosine, bursting in, lamp in hand, from the\r\ncorridor, \u201con est l\u00e0 pour vous au salon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame saw me, I saw Madame, Rosine saw us both: there was no mutual\r\nrecognition. I made straight for the salon. There I found what I own I\r\nanticipated I should find\u2014Dr. Bretton; but he was in evening-dress.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe carriage is at the door,\u201d said he; \u201cmy mother has sent it to take you to\r\nthe theatre; she was going herself, but an arrival has prevented her: she\r\nimmediately said, \u2018Take Lucy in my place.\u2019 Will you go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust now? I am not dressed,\u201d cried I, glancing despairingly at my dark merino.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have half an hour to dress. I should have given you notice, but I only\r\ndetermined on going since five o\u2019clock, when I heard there was to be a genuine\r\nregale in the presence of a great actress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he mentioned a name that thrilled me\u2014a name that, in those days, could\r\nthrill Europe. It is hushed now: its once restless echoes are all still; she\r\nwho bore it went years ago to her rest: night and oblivion long since closed\r\nabove her; but then her day\u2014a day of Sirius\u2014stood at its full height,\r\nlight and fervour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go; I will be ready in ten minutes,\u201d I vowed. And away I flew, never once\r\nchecked, reader, by the thought which perhaps at this moment checks you:\r\nnamely, that to go anywhere with Graham and without Mrs. Bretton could be\r\nobjectionable. I could not have conceived, much less have expressed to Graham,\r\nsuch thought\u2014such scruple\u2014without risk of exciting a tyrannous self-contempt:\r\nof kindling an inward fire of shame so quenchless, and so devouring, that I\r\nthink it would soon have licked up the very life in my veins. Besides, my\r\ngodmother, knowing her son, and knowing me, would as soon have thought of\r\nchaperoning a sister with a brother, as of keeping anxious guard over our\r\nincomings and outgoings.\r\n\n\r\nThe present was no occasion for showy array; my dun mist crape would suffice,\r\nand I sought the same in the great oak-wardrobe in the dormitory, where hung no\r\nless than forty dresses. But there had been changes and reforms, and some\r\ninnovating hand had pruned this same crowded wardrobe, and carried divers\r\ngarments to the grenier\u2014my crape amongst the rest. I must fetch it. I got the\r\nkey, and went aloft fearless, almost thoughtless. I unlocked the door, I\r\nplunged in. The reader may believe it or not, but when I thus suddenly entered,\r\nthat garret was not wholly dark as it should have been: from one point there\r\nshone a solemn light, like a star, but broader. So plainly it shone, that it\r\nrevealed the deep alcove with a portion of the tarnished scarlet curtain drawn\r\nover it. Instantly, silently, before my eyes, it vanished; so did the curtain\r\nand alcove: all that end of the garret became black as night. I ventured no\r\nresearch; I had not time nor will; snatching my dress, which hung on the wall,\r\nhappily near the door, I rushed out, relocked the door with convulsed haste,\r\nand darted downwards to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\nBut I trembled too much to dress myself: impossible to arrange hair or fasten\r\nhooks-and-eyes with such fingers, so I called Rosine and bribed her to help me.\r\nRosine liked a bribe, so she did her best, smoothed and plaited my hair as well\r\nas a coiffeur would have done, placed the lace collar mathematically straight,\r\ntied the neck-ribbon accurately\u2014in short, did her work like the neat-handed\r\nPhillis she could be when she chose. Having given me my handkerchief and\r\ngloves, she took the candle and lighted me down-stairs. After all, I had\r\nforgotten my shawl; she ran back to fetch it; and I stood with Dr. John in the\r\nvestibule, waiting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this, Lucy?\u201d said he, looking down at me narrowly. \u201cHere is the old\r\nexcitement. Ha! the nun again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I utterly denied the charge: I was vexed to be suspected of a second\r\nillusion. He was sceptical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has been, as sure as I live,\u201d said he; \u201cher figure crossing your eyes\r\nleaves on them a peculiar gleam and expression not to be mistaken.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has not been,\u201d I persisted: for, indeed, I could deny her\r\napparition with truth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe old symptoms are there,\u201d he affirmed: \u201ca particular pale, and what the\r\nScotch call a \u2018raised\u2019 look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was so obstinate, I thought it better to tell him what I really had\r\nseen. Of course with him it was held to be another effect of the same cause: it\r\nwas all optical illusion\u2014nervous malady, and so on. Not one bit did I believe\r\nhim; but I dared not contradict: doctors are so self-opinionated, so immovable\r\nin their dry, materialist views.\r\n\n\r\nRosine brought the shawl, and I was bundled into the carriage.\r\n\n\r\nThe theatre was full\u2014crammed to its roof: royal and noble were there: palace\r\nand hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed.\r\nDeeply did I feel myself privileged in having a place before that stage; I\r\nlonged to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which made me\r\nconceive peculiar anticipations. I wondered if she would justify her renown:\r\nwith strange curiosity, with feelings severe and austere, yet of riveted\r\ninterest, I waited. She was a study of such nature as had not encountered my\r\neyes yet: a great and new planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her\r\nrising.\r\n\n\r\nShe rose at nine that December night: above the horizon I saw her come. She\r\ncould shine yet with pale grandeur and steady might; but that star verged\r\nalready on its judgment-day. Seen near, it was a chaos\u2014hollow, half-consumed:\r\nan orb perished or perishing\u2014half lava, half glow.\r\n\n\r\nI had heard this woman termed \u201cplain,\u201d and I expected bony harshness and\r\ngrimness\u2014something large, angular, sallow. What I saw was the shadow of a royal\r\nVashti: a queen, fair as the day once, turned pale now like twilight, and\r\nwasted like wax in flame.\r\n\n\r\nFor a while\u2014a long while\u2014I thought it was only a woman, though an unique woman,\r\nwho moved in might and grace before this multitude. By-and-by I recognised my\r\nmistake. Behold! I found upon her something neither of woman nor of man: in\r\neach of her eyes sat a devil. These evil forces bore her through the tragedy,\r\nkept up her feeble strength\u2014for she was but a frail creature; and as the action\r\nrose and the stir deepened, how wildly they shook her with their passions of\r\nthe pit! They wrote HELL on her straight, haughty brow. They\r\ntuned her voice to the note of torment. They writhed her regal face to a\r\ndemoniac mask. Hate and Murder and Madness incarnate she stood.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a marvellous sight: a mighty revelation.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a spectacle low, horrible, immoral.\r\n\n\r\nSwordsmen thrust through, and dying in their blood on the arena sand; bulls\r\ngoring horses disembowelled, made a meeker vision for the public\u2014a milder\r\ncondiment for a people\u2019s palate\u2014than Vashti torn by seven devils: devils which\r\ncried sore and rent the tenement they haunted, but still refused to be\r\nexorcised.\r\n\n\r\nSuffering had struck that stage empress; and she stood before her audience\r\nneither yielding to, nor enduring, nor, in finite measure, resenting it: she\r\nstood locked in struggle, rigid in resistance. She stood, not dressed, but\r\ndraped in pale antique folds, long and regular like sculpture. A background and\r\nentourage and flooring of deepest crimson threw her out, white like\r\nalabaster\u2014like silver: rather, be it said, like Death.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was the artist of the Cleopatra? Let him come and sit down and study this\r\ndifferent vision. Let him seek here the mighty brawn, the muscle, the abounding\r\nblood, the full-fed flesh he worshipped: let all materialists draw nigh and\r\nlook on.\r\n\n\r\nI have said that she does not resent her grief. No; the weakness of that\r\nword would make it a lie. To her, what hurts becomes immediately embodied: she\r\nlooks on it as a thing that can be attacked, worried down, torn in shreds.\r\nScarcely a substance herself, she grapples to conflict with abstractions.\r\nBefore calamity she is a tigress; she rends her woes, shivers them in convulsed\r\nabhorrence. Pain, for her, has no result in good: tears water no harvest of\r\nwisdom: on sickness, on death itself, she looks with the eye of a rebel.\r\nWicked, perhaps, she is, but also she is strong; and her strength has conquered\r\nBeauty, has overcome Grace, and bound both at her side, captives peerlessly\r\nfair, and docile as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad\r\nmovement royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her hair, flying loose in\r\nrevel or war, is still an angel\u2019s hair, and glorious under a halo. Fallen,\r\ninsurgent, banished, she remembers the heaven where she rebelled. Heaven\u2019s\r\nlight, following her exile, pierces its confines, and discloses their forlorn\r\nremoteness.\r\n\n\r\nPlace now the Cleopatra, or any other slug, before her as an obstacle, and see\r\nher cut through the pulpy mass as the scimitar of Saladin clove the down\r\ncushion. Let Paul Peter Rubens wake from the dead, let him rise out of his\r\ncerements, and bring into this presence all the army of his fat women; the\r\nmagian power or prophet-virtue gifting that slight rod of Moses, could, at one\r\nwaft, release and re-mingle a sea spell-parted, whelming the heavy host with\r\nthe down-rush of overthrown sea-ramparts.\r\n\n\r\nVashti was not good, I was told; and I have said she did not look good: though\r\na spirit, she was a spirit out of Tophet. Well, if so much of unholy force can\r\narise from below, may not an equal efflux of sacred essence descend one day\r\nfrom above?\r\n\n\r\nWhat thought Dr. Graham of this being?\r\n\n\r\nFor long intervals I forgot to look how he demeaned himself, or to question\r\nwhat he thought. The strong magnetism of genius drew my heart out of its wonted\r\norbit; the sunflower turned from the south to a fierce light, not solar\u2014a\r\nrushing, red, cometary light\u2014hot on vision and to sensation. I had seen acting\r\nbefore, but never anything like this: never anything which astonished Hope and\r\nhushed Desire; which outstripped Impulse and paled Conception; which, instead\r\nof merely irritating imagination with the thought of what might be done,\r\nat the same time fevering the nerves because it was not done, disclosed\r\npower like a deep, swollen winter river, thundering in cataract, and bearing\r\nthe soul, like a leaf, on the steep and steelly sweep of its descent.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Fanshawe, with her usual ripeness of judgment, pronounced Dr. Bretton a\r\nserious, impassioned man, too grave and too impressible. Not in such light did\r\nI ever see him: no such faults could I lay to his charge. His natural attitude\r\nwas not the meditative, nor his natural mood the sentimental;\r\nimpressionable he was as dimpling water, but, almost as water,\r\nunimpressible: the breeze, the sun, moved him\u2014metal could not grave, nor\r\nfire brand.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John could think and think well, but he was rather a man of action\r\nthan of thought; he could feel, and feel vividly in his way, but his\r\nheart had no chord for enthusiasm: to bright, soft, sweet influences his eyes\r\nand lips gave bright, soft, sweet welcome, beautiful to see as dyes of rose and\r\nsilver, pearl and purple, imbuing summer clouds; for what belonged to storm,\r\nwhat was wild and intense, dangerous, sudden, and flaming, he had no sympathy,\r\nand held with it no communion. When I took time and regained inclination to\r\nglance at him, it amused and enlightened me to discover that he was watching\r\nthat sinister and sovereign Vashti, not with wonder, nor worship, nor yet\r\ndismay, but simply with intense curiosity. Her agony did not pain him, her wild\r\nmoan\u2014worse than a shriek\u2014did not much move him; her fury revolted him somewhat,\r\nbut not to the point of horror. Cool young Briton! The pale cliffs of his own\r\nEngland do not look down on the tides of the Channel more calmly than he\r\nwatched the Pythian inspiration of that night.\r\n\n\r\nLooking at his face, I longed to know his exact opinions, and at last I put a\r\nquestion tending to elicit them. At the sound of my voice he awoke as if out of\r\na dream; for he had been thinking, and very intently thinking, his own\r\nthoughts, after his own manner. \u201cHow did he like Vashti?\u201d I wished to know.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHm-m-m,\u201d was the first scarce articulate but expressive answer; and then such\r\na strange smile went wandering round his lips, a smile so critical, so almost\r\ncallous! I suppose that for natures of that order his sympathies were\r\ncallous. In a few terse phrases he told me his opinion of, and feeling towards,\r\nthe actress: he judged her as a woman, not an artist: it was a branding\r\njudgment.\r\n\n\r\nThat night was already marked in my book of life, not with white, but with a\r\ndeep-red cross. But I had not done with it yet; and other memoranda were\r\ndestined to be set down in characters of tint indelible.\r\n\n\r\nTowards midnight, when the deepening tragedy blackened to the death-scene, and\r\nall held their breath, and even Graham bit his under-lip, and knit his brow,\r\nand sat still and struck\u2014when the whole theatre was hushed, when the vision of\r\nall eyes centred in one point, when all ears listened towards one\r\nquarter\u2014nothing being seen but the white form sunk on a seat, quivering in\r\nconflict with her last, her worst-hated, her visibly-conquering foe\u2014nothing\r\nheard but her throes, her gaspings, breathing yet of mutiny, panting still\r\ndefiance; when, as it seemed, an inordinate will, convulsing a perishing mortal\r\nframe, bent it to battle with doom and death, fought every inch of ground, sold\r\nevery drop of blood, resisted to the latest the rape of every faculty,\r\nwould see, would hear, would breathe, would live,\r\nup to, within, well-nigh beyond the moment when death says to all sense\r\nand all being\u2014\u201cThus far and no farther!\u201d\u2014\r\n\n\r\nJust then a stir, pregnant with omen, rustled behind the scenes\u2014feet ran,\r\nvoices spoke. What was it? demanded the whole house. A flame, a smell of smoke\r\nreplied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d rang through the gallery. \u201cFire!\u201d was repeated, re-echoed, yelled\r\nforth: and then, and faster than pen can set it down, came panic, rushing,\r\ncrushing\u2014a blind, selfish, cruel chaos.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Dr. John? Reader, I see him yet, with his look of comely courage and\r\ncordial calm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy will sit still, I know,\u201d said he, glancing down at me with the same\r\nserene goodness, the same repose of firmness that I have seen in him when\r\nsitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mother\u2019s hearth. Yes, thus\r\nadjured, I think I would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to\r\nsit still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and at the price of my very\r\nlife, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart his will, or make\r\ndemands on his attention. We were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there\r\nwas a most terrible, ruthless pressure about us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow terrified are the women!\u201d said he; \u201cbut if the men were not almost equally\r\nso, order might be maintained. This is a sorry scene: I see fifty selfish\r\nbrutes at this moment, each of whom, if I were near, I could conscientiously\r\nknock down. I see some women braver than some men. There is one yonder\u2014Good\r\nGod!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile Graham was speaking, a young girl who had been very quietly and steadily\r\nclinging to a gentleman before us, was suddenly struck from her protector\u2019s\r\narms by a big, butcherly intruder, and hurled under the feet of the crowd.\r\nScarce two seconds lasted her disappearance. Graham rushed forwards; he and the\r\ngentleman, a powerful man though grey-haired, united their strength to thrust\r\nback the throng; her head and long hair fell back over his shoulder: she seemed\r\nunconscious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrust her with me; I am a medical man,\u201d said Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you have no lady with you, be it so,\u201d was the answer. \u201cHold her, and I will\r\nforce a passage: we must get her to the air.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a lady,\u201d said Graham; \u201cbut she will be neither hindrance nor\r\nincumbrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe summoned me with his eye: we were separated. Resolute, however, to rejoin\r\nhim, I penetrated the living barrier, creeping under where I could not get\r\nbetween or over.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFasten on me, and don\u2019t leave go,\u201d he said; and I obeyed him.\r\n\n\r\nOur pioneer proved strong and adroit; he opened the dense mass like a wedge;\r\nwith patience and toil he at last bored through the flesh-and-blood rock\u2014so\r\nsolid, hot, and suffocating\u2014and brought us to the fresh, freezing night.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are an Englishman!\u201d said he, turning shortly on Dr. Bretton, when we got\r\ninto the street.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn Englishman. And I speak to a countryman?\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight. Be good enough to stand here two minutes, whilst I find my carriage.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I am not hurt,\u201d said a girlish voice; \u201cam I with papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are with a friend, and your father is close at hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him I am not hurt, except just in my shoulder. Oh, my shoulder! They trod\r\njust here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDislocation, perhaps!\u201d muttered the Doctor: \u201clet us hope there is no worse\r\ninjury done. Lucy, lend a hand one instant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I assisted while he made some arrangement of drapery and position for the\r\nease of his suffering burden. She suppressed a moan, and lay in his arms\r\nquietly and patiently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is very light,\u201d said Graham, \u201clike a child!\u201d and he asked in my ear, \u201cIs\r\nshe a child, Lucy? Did you notice her age?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not a child\u2014I am a person of seventeen,\u201d responded the patient, demurely\r\nand with dignity. Then, directly after: \u201cTell papa to come; I get anxious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe carriage drove up; her father relieved Graham; but in the exchange from one\r\nbearer to another she was hurt, and moaned again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy darling!\u201d said the father, tenderly; then turning to Graham, \u201cYou said,\r\nsir, you are a medical man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am: Dr. Bretton, of La Terrasse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood. Will you step into my carriage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy own carriage is here: I will seek it, and accompany you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe pleased, then, to follow us.\u201d And he named his address: \u201cThe H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy,\r\nin the Rue Cr\u00e9cy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe followed; the carriage drove fast; myself and Graham were silent. This\r\nseemed like an adventure.\r\n\n\r\nSome little time being lost in seeking our own equipage, we reached the hotel\r\nperhaps about ten minutes after these strangers. It was an hotel in the foreign\r\nsense: a collection of dwelling-houses, not an inn\u2014a vast, lofty pile, with a\r\nhuge arch to its street-door, leading through a vaulted covered way, into a\r\nsquare all built round.\r\n\n\r\nWe alighted, passed up a wide, handsome public staircase, and stopped at Num\u00e9ro\r\n2 on the second landing; the first floor comprising the abode of I know not\r\nwhat \u201cprince Russe,\u201d as Graham informed me. On ringing the bell at a second\r\ngreat door, we were admitted to a suite of very handsome apartments. Announced\r\nby a servant in livery, we entered a drawing-room whose hearth glowed with an\r\nEnglish fire, and whose walls gleamed with foreign mirrors. Near the hearth\r\nappeared a little group: a slight form sunk in a deep arm-chair, one or two\r\nwomen busy about it, the iron-grey gentleman anxiously looking on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Harriet? I wish Harriet would come to me,\u201d said the girlish voice,\r\nfaintly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Mrs. Hurst?\u201d demanded the gentleman impatiently and somewhat sternly\r\nof the man-servant who had admitted us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to say she is gone out of town, sir; my young lady gave her leave\r\ntill to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014I did\u2014I did. She is gone to see her sister; I said she might go: I\r\nremember now,\u201d interposed the young lady; \u201cbut I am so sorry, for Manon and\r\nLouison cannot understand a word I say, and they hurt me without meaning to do\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDr. John and the gentleman now interchanged greetings; and while they passed a\r\nfew minutes in consultation, I approached the easy-chair, and seeing what the\r\nfaint and sinking girl wished to have done, I did it for her.\r\n\n\r\nI was still occupied in the arrangement, when Graham drew near; he was no less\r\nskilled in surgery than medicine, and, on examination, found that no further\r\nadvice than his own was necessary to the treatment of the present case. He\r\nordered her to be carried to her chamber, and whispered to me:\u2014\u201cGo with the\r\nwomen, Lucy; they seem but dull; you can at least direct their movements, and\r\nthus spare her some pain. She must be touched very tenderly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe chamber was a room shadowy with pale-blue hangings, vaporous with\r\ncurtainings and veilings of muslin; the bed seemed to me like snow-drift and\r\nmist\u2014spotless, soft, and gauzy. Making the women stand apart, I undressed their\r\nmistress, without their well-meaning but clumsy aid. I was not in a\r\nsufficiently collected mood to note with separate distinctness every detail of\r\nthe attire I removed, but I received a general impression of refinement,\r\ndelicacy, and perfect personal cultivation; which, in a period of\r\nafter-thought, offered in my reflections a singular contrast to notes retained\r\nof Miss Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s appointments.\r\n\n\r\nThe girl was herself a small, delicate creature, but made like a model. As I\r\nfolded back her plentiful yet fine hair, so shining and soft, and so\r\nexquisitely tended, I had under my observation a young, pale, weary, but\r\nhigh-bred face. The brow was smooth and clear; the eyebrows were distinct, but\r\nsoft, and melting to a mere trace at the temples; the eyes were a rich gift of\r\nnature\u2014fine and full, large, deep, seeming to hold dominion over the slighter\r\nsubordinate features\u2014capable, probably, of much significance at another hour\r\nand under other circumstances than the present, but now languid and suffering.\r\nHer skin was perfectly fair, the neck and hands veined finely like the petals\r\nof a flower; a thin glazing of the ice of pride polished this delicate\r\nexterior, and her lip wore a curl\u2014I doubt not inherent and unconscious, but\r\nwhich, if I had seen it first with the accompaniments of health and state,\r\nwould have struck me as unwarranted, and proving in the little lady a quite\r\nmistaken view of life and her own consequence.\r\n\n\r\nHer demeanour under the Doctor\u2019s hands at first excited a smile; it was not\r\npuerile\u2014rather, on the whole, patient and firm\u2014but yet, once or twice she\r\naddressed him with suddenness and sharpness, saying that he hurt her, and must\r\ncontrive to give her less pain; I saw her large eyes, too, settle on his face\r\nlike the solemn eyes of some pretty, wondering child. I know not whether Graham\r\nfelt this examination: if he did, he was cautious not to check or discomfort it\r\nby any retaliatory look. I think he performed his work with extreme care and\r\ngentleness, sparing her what pain he could; and she acknowledged as much, when\r\nhe had done, by the words:\u2014\u201cThank you, Doctor, and good-night,\u201d very gratefully\r\npronounced as she uttered them, however, it was with a repetition of the\r\nserious, direct gaze, I thought, peculiar in its gravity and intentness.\r\n\n\r\nThe injuries, it seems, were not dangerous: an assurance which her father\r\nreceived with a smile that almost made one his friend\u2014it was so glad and\r\ngratified. He now expressed his obligations to Graham with as much earnestness\r\nas was befitting an Englishman addressing one who has served him, but is yet a\r\nstranger; he also begged him to call the next day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa,\u201d said a voice from the veiled couch, \u201cthank the lady, too; is she\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI opened the curtain with a smile, and looked in at her. She lay now at\r\ncomparative ease; she looked pretty, though pale; her face was delicately\r\ndesigned, and if at first sight it appeared proud, I believe custom might prove\r\nit to be soft.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thank the lady very sincerely,\u201d said her father: \u201cI fancy she has been very\r\ngood to my child. I think we scarcely dare tell Mrs. Hurst who has been her\r\nsubstitute and done her work; she will feel at once ashamed and jealous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, in the most friendly spirit, parting greetings were interchanged; and\r\nrefreshment having been hospitably offered, but by us, as it was late, refused,\r\nwe withdrew from the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy.\r\n\n\r\nOn our way back we repassed the theatre. All was silence and darkness: the\r\nroaring, rushing crowd all vanished and gone\u2014the damps, as well as the\r\nincipient fire, extinct and forgotten. Next morning\u2019s papers explained that it\r\nwas but some loose drapery on which a spark had fallen, and which had blazed up\r\nand been quenched in a moment.\r\n\n"}
{"25": "\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nM. DE BASSOMPIERRE.\n\r\nThose who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of\r\nschools or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly\r\nand for a long while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens\r\nof a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of\r\nunusually frequent intercourse\u2014some congeries of rather exciting little\r\ncircumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem to be the quickening than\r\nthe suspension of communication\u2014there falls a stilly pause, a wordless silence,\r\na long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire and\r\nunexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit,\r\nformerly periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other token that\r\nindicated remembrance, comes no more.\r\n\n\r\nAlways there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but knew\r\nthem. Though he is stagnant in his cell, his connections without are whirling\r\nin the very vortex of life. That void interval which passes for him so slowly\r\nthat the very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours plod by in the\r\nlikeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestones\u2014that same interval,\r\nperhaps, teems with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.\r\n\n\r\nThe hermit\u2014if he be a sensible hermit\u2014will swallow his own thoughts, and lock\r\nup his own emotions during these weeks of inward winter. He will know that\r\nDestiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the dormouse, and he will be\r\nconformable: make a tidy ball of himself, creep into a hole of life\u2019s wall, and\r\nsubmit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving\r\nhim in ice for the season.\r\n\n\r\nLet him say, \u201cIt is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.\u201d And,\r\nperhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will open, spring\u2019s softness will return,\r\nthe sun and south-wind will reach him; the budding of hedges, and carolling of\r\nbirds, and singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.\r\nPerhaps this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get into his\r\nheart and never thaw more; when spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of\r\nthe wall only his dormouse-bones. Well, even in that case, all will be right:\r\nit is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal, and must one day go\r\nthe way of all flesh, \u201cAs well soon as syne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFollowing that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks as bare\r\nas seven sheets of blank paper: no word was written on one of them; not a\r\nvisit, not a token.\r\n\n\r\nAbout the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had happened\r\nto my friends at La Terrasse. The mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the\r\nsolitary: his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy; the doubts\r\nhitherto repelled gather now to a mass and\u2014strong in accumulation\u2014roll back\r\nupon him with a force which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an\r\nunkindly time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree: strange starts and\r\nstruggles harass his couch: the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of\r\ncalamity, and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league\r\nagainst him. Poor wretch! He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor,\r\npallid, wasting wretch, despite that best.\r\n\n\r\nTowards the last of these long seven weeks I admitted, what through the other\r\nsix I had jealously excluded\u2014the conviction that these blanks were inevitable:\r\nthe result of circumstances, the fiat of fate, a part of my life\u2019s lot\r\nand\u2014above all\u2014a matter about whose origin no question must ever be asked, for\r\nwhose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered. Of course I did not blame myself\r\nfor suffering: I thank God I had a truer sense of justice than to fall into any\r\nimbecile extravagance of self-accusation; and as to blaming others for silence,\r\nin my reason I well knew them blameless, and in my heart acknowledged them so:\r\nbut it was a rough and heavy road to travel, and I longed for better days.\r\n\n\r\nI tried different expedients to sustain and fill existence: I commenced an\r\nelaborate piece of lace-work, I studied German pretty hard, I undertook a\r\ncourse of regular reading of the driest and thickest books in the library; in\r\nall my efforts I was as orthodox as I knew how to be. Was there error\r\nsomewhere? Very likely. I only know the result was as if I had gnawed a file to\r\nsatisfy hunger, or drank brine to quench thirst.\r\n\n\r\nMy hour of torment was the post-hour. Unfortunately, I knew it too well, and\r\ntried as vainly as assiduously to cheat myself of that knowledge; dreading the\r\nrack of expectation, and the sick collapse of disappointment which daily\r\npreceded and followed upon that well-recognised ring.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose animals kept in cages, and so scantily fed as to be always upon the\r\nverge of famine, await their food as I awaited a letter. Oh!\u2014to speak truth,\r\nand drop that tone of a false calm which long to sustain, outwears nature\u2019s\r\nendurance\u2014I underwent in those seven weeks bitter fears and pains, strange\r\ninward trials, miserable defections of hope, intolerable encroachments of\r\ndespair. This last came so near me sometimes that her breath went right through\r\nme. I used to feel it like a baleful air or sigh, penetrate deep, and make\r\nmotion pause at my heart, or proceed only under unspeakable oppression. The\r\nletter\u2014the well-beloved letter\u2014would not come; and it was all of sweetness in\r\nlife I had to look for.\r\n\n\r\nIn the very extremity of want, I had recourse again, and yet again, to the\r\nlittle packet in the case\u2014the five letters. How splendid that month seemed\r\nwhose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars! It was always at night I\r\nvisited them, and not daring to ask every evening for a candle in the kitchen,\r\nI bought a wax taper and matches to light it, and at the study-hour stole up to\r\nthe dormitory and feasted on my crust from the Barmecide\u2019s loaf. It did not\r\nnourish me: I pined on it, and got as thin as a shadow: otherwise I was not\r\nill.\r\n\n\r\nReading there somewhat late one evening, and feeling that the power to read was\r\nleaving me\u2014for the letters from incessant perusal were losing all sap and\r\nsignificance: my gold was withering to leaves before my eyes, and I was\r\nsorrowing over the disillusion\u2014suddenly a quick tripping foot ran up the\r\nstairs. I knew Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s step: she had dined in town that afternoon;\r\nshe was now returned, and would come here to replace her shawl, &c. in the\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\n\r\nYes: in she came, dressed in bright silk, with her shawl falling from her\r\nshoulders, and her curls, half-uncurled in the damp of night, drooping careless\r\nand heavy upon her neck. I had hardly time to recasket my treasures and lock\r\nthem up when she was at my side her humour seemed none of the best.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a stupid evening: they are stupid people,\u201d she began.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho? Mrs. Cholmondeley? I thought you always found her house charming?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not been to Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Have you made new acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle de Bassompierre is come.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour uncle de Bassompierre! Are you not glad?\u2014I thought he was a favourite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought wrong: the man is odious; I hate him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is a foreigner? or for what other reason of equal weight?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is not a foreigner. The man is English enough, goodness knows; and had an\r\nEnglish name till three or four years ago; but his mother was a foreigner, a de\r\nBassompierre, and some of her family are dead and have left him estates, a\r\ntitle, and this name: he is quite a great man now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you hate him for that reason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know what mamma says about him? He is not my own uncle, but married\r\nmamma\u2019s sister. Mamma detests him; she says he killed aunt Ginevra with\r\nunkindness: he looks like a bear. Such a dismal evening!\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019ll go\r\nno more to his big hotel. Fancy me walking into a room alone, and a great man\r\nfifty years old coming forwards, and after a few minutes\u2019 conversation actually\r\nturning his back upon me, and then abruptly going out of the room. Such odd\r\nways! I daresay his conscience smote him, for they all say at home I am the\r\npicture of aunt Ginevra. Mamma often declares the likeness is quite\r\nridiculous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere you the only visitor?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe only visitor? Yes; then there was missy, my cousin: little spoiled,\r\npampered thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. de Bassompierre has a daughter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes: don\u2019t tease one with questions. Oh, dear! I am so tired.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe yawned. Throwing herself without ceremony on my bed she added, \u201cIt seems\r\nMademoiselle was nearly crushed to a jelly in a hubbub at the theatre some\r\nweeks ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! indeed. And they live at a large hotel in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustement. How do you know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have been there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you have? Really! You go everywhere in these days. I suppose Mother\r\nBretton took you. She and Esculapius have the entr\u00e9e of the de\r\nBassompierre apartments: it seems \u2018my son John\u2019 attended missy on the occasion\r\nof her accident\u2014Accident? Bah! All affectation! I don\u2019t think she was squeezed\r\nmore than she richly deserves for her airs. And now there is quite an intimacy\r\nstruck up: I heard something about \u2018auld lang syne,\u2019 and what not. Oh, how\r\nstupid they all were!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll! You said you were the only visitor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I? You see one forgets to particularize an old woman and her boy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. and Mrs. Bretton were at M. de Bassompierre\u2019s this evening?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay! as large as life; and missy played the hostess. What a conceited doll\r\nit is!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoured and listless, Miss Fanshawe was beginning to disclose the causes of her\r\nprostrate condition. There had been a retrenchment of incense, a diversion or a\r\ntotal withholding of homage and attention coquetry had failed of effect, vanity\r\nhad undergone mortification. She lay fuming in the vapours.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Miss de Bassompierre quite well now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs well as you or I, no doubt; but she is an affected little thing, and gave\r\nherself invalid airs to attract medical notice. And to see the old dowager\r\nmaking her recline on a couch, and \u2018my son John\u2019 prohibiting excitement,\r\netcetera\u2014faugh! the scene was quite sickening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would not have been so if the object of attention had been changed: if you\r\nhad taken Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s place.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! I hate \u2018my son John!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My son John!\u2019\u2014whom do you indicate by that name? Dr. Bretton\u2019s mother never\r\ncalls him so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen she ought. A clownish, bearish John he is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou violate the truth in saying so; and as the whole of my patience is now\r\nspun off the distaff, I peremptorily desire you to rise from that bed, and\r\nvacate this room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPassionate thing! Your face is the colour of a coquelicot. I wonder what\r\nalways makes you so mighty testy \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du gros Jean? \u2018John Anderson, my\r\nJoe, John!\u2019 Oh, the distinguished name!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThrilling with exasperation, to which it would have been sheer folly to have\r\ngiven vent\u2014for there was no contending with that unsubstantial feather, that\r\nmealy-winged moth\u2014I extinguished my taper, locked my bureau, and left her,\r\nsince she would not leave me. Small-beer as she was, she had turned\r\ninsufferably acid.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow was Thursday and a half-holiday. Breakfast was over; I had withdrawn\r\nto the first classe. The dreaded hour, the post-hour, was nearing, and I sat\r\nwaiting it, much as a ghost-seer might wait his spectre. Less than ever was a\r\nletter probable; still, strive as I would, I could not forget that it was\r\npossible. As the moments lessened, a restlessness and fear almost beyond the\r\naverage assailed me. It was a day of winter east wind, and I had now for some\r\ntime entered into that dreary fellowship with the winds and their changes, so\r\nlittle known, so incomprehensible to the healthy. The north and east owned a\r\nterrific influence, making all pain more poignant, all sorrow sadder. The south\r\ncould calm, the west sometimes cheer: unless, indeed, they brought on their\r\nwings the burden of thunder-clouds, under the weight and warmth of which all\r\nenergy died.\r\n\n\r\nBitter and dark as was this January day, I remember leaving the classe, and\r\nrunning down without bonnet to the bottom of the long garden, and then\r\nlingering amongst the stripped shrubs, in the forlorn hope that the postman\u2019s\r\nring might occur while I was out of hearing, and I might thus be spared the\r\nthrill which some particular nerve or nerves, almost gnawed through with the\r\nunremitting tooth of a fixed idea, were becoming wholly unfit to support. I\r\nlingered as long as I dared without fear of attracting attention by my absence.\r\nI muffled my head in my apron, and stopped my ears in terror of the torturing\r\nclang, sure to be followed by such blank silence, such barren vacuum for me. At\r\nlast I ventured to re-enter the first classe, where, as it was not yet nine\r\no\u2019clock, no pupils had been admitted. The first thing seen was a white object\r\non my black desk, a white, flat object. The post had, indeed, arrived; by me\r\nunheard. Rosine had visited my cell, and, like some angel, had left behind her\r\na bright token of her presence. That shining thing on the desk was indeed a\r\nletter, a real letter; I saw so much at the distance of three yards, and as I\r\nhad but one correspondent on earth, from that one it must come. He remembered\r\nme yet. How deep a pulse of gratitude sent new life through my heart.\r\n\n\r\nDrawing near, bending and looking on the letter, in trembling but almost\r\ncertain hope of seeing a known hand, it was my lot to find, on the contrary, an\r\nautograph for the moment deemed unknown\u2014a pale female scrawl, instead of a\r\nfirm, masculine character. I then thought fate was too hard for me, and\r\nI said, audibly, \u201cThis is cruel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I got over that pain also. Life is still life, whatever its pangs: our eyes\r\nand ears and their use remain with us, though the prospect of what pleases be\r\nwholly withdrawn, and the sound of what consoles be quite silenced.\r\n\n\r\nI opened the billet: by this time I had recognised its handwriting as perfectly\r\nfamiliar. It was dated \u201cLa Terrasse,\u201d and it ran thus:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDEAR LUCY,\u2014It occurs to me to inquire what you have been doing with yourself\r\nfor the last month or two? Not that I suspect you would have the least\r\ndifficulty in giving an account of your proceedings. I daresay you have been\r\njust as busy and as happy as ourselves at La Terrasse. As to Graham, his\r\nprofessional connection extends daily: he is so much sought after, so much\r\nengaged, that I tell him he will grow quite conceited. Like a right good\r\nmother, as I am, I do my best to keep him down: no flattery does he get from\r\nme, as you know. And yet, Lucy, he is a fine fellow: his mother\u2019s heart dances\r\nat the sight of him. After being hurried here and there the whole day, and\r\npassing the ordeal of fifty sorts of tempers, and combating a hundred caprices,\r\nand sometimes witnessing cruel sufferings\u2014perhaps, occasionally, as I tell him,\r\ninflicting them\u2014at night he still comes home to me in such kindly, pleasant\r\nmood, that really, I seem to live in a sort of moral antipodes, and on these\r\nJanuary evenings my day rises when other people\u2019s night sets in.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStill he needs keeping in order, and correcting, and repressing, and I do\r\nhim that good service; but the boy is so elastic there is no such thing as\r\nvexing him thoroughly. When I think I have at last driven him to the sullens,\r\nhe turns on me with jokes for retaliation: but you know him and all his\r\niniquities, and I am but an elderly simpleton to make him the subject of this\r\nepistle.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs for me, I have had my old Bretton agent here on a visit, and have been\r\nplunged overhead and ears in business matters. I do so wish to regain for\r\nGraham at least some part of what his father left him. He laughs to scorn my\r\nanxiety on this point, bidding me look and see how he can provide for himself\r\nand me too, and asking what the old lady can possibly want that she has not;\r\nhinting about sky-blue turbans; accusing me of an ambition to wear diamonds,\r\nkeep livery servants, have an hotel, and lead the fashion amongst the English\r\nclan in Villette.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTalking of sky-blue turbans, I wish you had been with us the other\r\nevening. He had come in really tired, and after I had given him his tea, he\r\nthrew himself into my chair with his customary presumption. To my great\r\ndelight, he dropped asleep. (You know how he teases me about being drowsy; I,\r\nwho never, by any chance, close an eye by daylight.) While he slept, I thought\r\nhe looked very bonny, Lucy: fool as I am to be so proud of him; but who can\r\nhelp it? Show me his peer. Look where I will, I see nothing like him in\r\nVillette. Well, I took it into my head to play him a trick: so I brought out\r\nthe sky-blue turban, and handling it with gingerly precaution, I managed to\r\ninvest his brows with this grand adornment. I assure you it did not at all\r\nmisbecome him; he looked quite Eastern, except that he is so fair. Nobody,\r\nhowever, can accuse him of having red hair now\u2014it is genuine chestnut\u2014a\r\ndark, glossy chestnut; and when I put my large cashmere about him, there was as\r\nfine a young bey, dey, or pacha improvised as you would wish to see.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt was good entertainment; but only half-enjoyed, since I was alone: you\r\nshould have been there.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn due time my lord awoke: the looking-glass above the fireplace soon\r\nintimated to him his plight: as you may imagine, I now live under threat and\r\ndread of vengeance.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut to come to the gist of my letter. I know Thursday is a half-holiday in\r\nthe Rue Fossette: be ready, then, by five in the afternoon, at which hour I\r\nwill send the carriage to take you out to La Terrasse. Be sure to come: you may\r\nmeet some old acquaintance. Good-by, my wise, dear, grave little\r\ngod-daughter.\u2014Very truly yours,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLOUISA BRETTON.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, a letter like that sets one to rights! I might still be sad after reading\r\nthat letter, but I was more composed; not exactly cheered, perhaps, but\r\nrelieved. My friends, at least, were well and happy: no accident had occurred\r\nto Graham; no illness had seized his mother\u2014calamities that had so long been my\r\ndream and thought. Their feelings for me too were\u2014as they had been. Yet, how\r\nstrange it was to look on Mrs. Bretton\u2019s seven weeks and contrast them with my\r\nseven weeks! Also, how very wise it is in people placed in an exceptional\r\nposition to hold their tongues and not rashly declare how such position galls\r\nthem! The world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want of\r\nfood: perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of going mad from\r\nsolitary confinement. They see the long-buried prisoner disinterred, a maniac\r\nor an idiot!\u2014how his senses left him\u2014how his nerves, first inflamed, underwent\r\nnameless agony, and then sunk to palsy\u2014is a subject too intricate for\r\nexamination, too abstract for popular comprehension. Speak of it! you might\r\nalmost as well stand up in an European market-place, and propound dark sayings\r\nin that language and mood wherein Nebuchadnezzar, the imperial hypochondriac,\r\ncommuned with his baffled Chaldeans. And long, long may the minds to whom such\r\nthemes are no mystery\u2014by whom their bearings are sympathetically seized\u2014be few\r\nin number, and rare of rencounter. Long may it be generally thought that\r\nphysical privations alone merit compassion, and that the rest is a figment.\r\nWhen the world was younger and haler than now, moral trials were a deeper\r\nmystery still: perhaps in all the land of Israel there was but one\r\nSaul\u2014certainly but one David to soothe or comprehend him.\r\n\n\r\nThe keen, still cold of the morning was succeeded, later in the day, by a sharp\r\nbreathing from Russian wastes: the cold zone sighed over the temperate zone,\r\nand froze it fast. A heavy firmament, dull, and thick with snow, sailed up from\r\nthe north, and settled over expectant Europe. Towards afternoon began the\r\ndescent. I feared no carriage would come, the white tempest raged so dense and\r\nwild. But trust my godmother! Once having asked, she would have her guest.\r\nAbout six o\u2019clock I was lifted from the carriage over the already blocked-up\r\nfront steps of the ch\u00e2teau, and put in at the door of La Terrasse.\r\n\n\r\nRunning through the vestibule, and up-stairs to the drawing-room, there I found\r\nMrs. Bretton\u2014a summer-day in her own person. Had I been twice as cold as I was,\r\nher kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me. Inured now for so long a\r\ntime to rooms with bare boards, black benches, desks, and stoves, the blue\r\nsaloon seemed to me gorgeous. In its Christmas-like fire alone there was a\r\nclear and crimson splendour which quite dazzled me.\r\n\n\r\nWhen my godmother had held my hand for a little while, and chatted with me, and\r\nscolded me for having become thinner than when she last saw me, she professed\r\nto discover that the snow-wind had disordered my hair, and sent me up-stairs to\r\nmake it neat and remove my shawl.\r\n\n\r\nRepairing to my own little sea-green room, there also I found a bright fire,\r\nand candles too were lit: a tall waxlight stood on each side the great\r\nlooking-glass; but between the candles, and before the glass, appeared\r\nsomething dressing itself\u2014an airy, fairy thing\u2014small, slight, white\u2014a winter\r\nspirit.\r\n\n\r\nI declare, for one moment I thought of Graham and his spectral illusions. With\r\ndistrustful eye I noted the details of this new vision. It wore white,\r\nsprinkled slightly with drops of scarlet; its girdle was red; it had something\r\nin its hair leafy, yet shining\u2014a little wreath with an evergreen gloss.\r\nSpectral or not, here truly was nothing frightful, and I advanced.\r\n\n\r\nTurning quick upon me, a large eye, under long lashes, flashed over me, the\r\nintruder: the lashes were as dark as long, and they softened with their\r\npencilling the orb they guarded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you are come!\u201d she breathed out, in a soft, quiet voice, and she smiled\r\nslowly, and gazed intently.\r\n\n\r\nI knew her now. Having only once seen that sort of face, with that cast of fine\r\nand delicate featuring, I could not but know her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss de Bassompierre,\u201d I pronounced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d was the reply, \u201cnot Miss de Bassompierre for you!\u201d I did not\r\ninquire who then she might be, but waited voluntary information.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are changed, but still you are yourself,\u201d she said, approaching nearer. \u201cI\r\nremember you well\u2014your countenance, the colour of your hair, the outline of\r\nyour face\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had moved to the fire, and she stood opposite, and gazed into me; and as she\r\ngazed, her face became gradually more and more expressive of thought and\r\nfeeling, till at last a dimness quenched her clear vision.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt makes me almost cry to look so far back,\u201d said she: \u201cbut as to being sorry,\r\nor sentimental, don\u2019t think it: on the contrary, I am quite pleased and glad.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInterested, yet altogether at fault, I knew not what to say. At last I\r\nstammered, \u201cI think I never met you till that night, some weeks ago, when you\r\nwere hurt\u2026?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe smiled. \u201cYou have forgotten then that I have sat on your knee, been lifted\r\nin your arms, even shared your pillow? You no longer remember the night when I\r\ncame crying, like a naughty little child as I was, to your bedside, and you\r\ntook me in. You have no memory for the comfort and protection by which you\r\nsoothed an acute distress? Go back to Bretton. Remember Mr. Home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt last I saw it all. \u201cAnd you are little Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow time can change! Little Polly wore in her pale, small features, her fairy\r\nsymmetry, her varying expression, a certain promise of interest and grace; but\r\nPaulina Mary was become beautiful\u2014not with the beauty that strikes the eye like\r\na rose\u2014orbed, ruddy, and replete; not with the plump, and pink, and flaxen\r\nattributes of her blond cousin Ginevra; but her seventeen years had brought her\r\na refined and tender charm which did not lie in complexion, though hers was\r\nfair and clear; nor in outline, though her features were sweet, and her limbs\r\nperfectly turned; but, I think, rather in a subdued glow from the soul outward.\r\nThis was not an opaque vase, of material however costly, but a lamp chastely\r\nlucent, guarding from extinction, yet not hiding from worship, a flame vital\r\nand vestal. In speaking of her attractions, I would not exaggerate language;\r\nbut, indeed, they seemed to me very real and engaging. What though all was on a\r\nsmall scale, it was the perfume which gave this white violet distinction, and\r\nmade it superior to the broadest camelia\u2014the fullest dahlia that ever bloomed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! and you remember the old time at Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d said she, \u201cbetter, perhaps, than you. I remember it with minute\r\ndistinctness: not only the time, but the days of the time, and the hours of the\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must have forgotten some things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery little, I imagine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou were then a little creature of quick feelings: you must, long ere this,\r\nhave outgrown the impressions with which joy and grief, affection and\r\nbereavement, stamped your mind ten years ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think I have forgotten whom I liked, and in what degree I liked them when\r\na child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sharpness must be gone\u2014the point, the poignancy\u2014the deep imprint must be\r\nsoftened away and effaced?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a good memory for those days.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked as if she had. Her eyes were the eyes of one who can remember; one\r\nwhose childhood does not fade like a dream, nor whose youth vanish like a\r\nsunbeam. She would not take life, loosely and incoherently, in parts, and let\r\none season slip as she entered on another: she would retain and add; often\r\nreview from the commencement, and so grow in harmony and consistency as she\r\ngrew in years. Still I could not quite admit the conviction that all the\r\npictures which now crowded upon me were vivid and visible to her. Her fond\r\nattachments, her sports and contests with a well-loved playmate, the patient,\r\ntrue devotion of her child\u2019s heart, her fears, her delicate reserves, her\r\nlittle trials, the last piercing pain of separation\u2026. I retraced these things,\r\nand shook my head incredulous. She persisted. \u201cThe child of seven years lives\r\nyet in the girl of seventeen,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou used to be excessively fond of Mrs. Bretton,\u201d I remarked, intending to\r\ntest her. She set me right at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot excessively fond,\u201d said she; \u201cI liked her: I respected her as I\r\nshould do now: she seems to me very little altered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is not much changed,\u201d I assented.\r\n\n\r\nWe were silent a few minutes. Glancing round the room she said, \u201cThere are\r\nseveral things here that used to be at Bretton! I remember that pincushion and\r\nthat looking-glass.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEvidently she was not deceived in her estimate of her own memory; not, at\r\nleast, so far.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think, then, you would have known Mrs. Bretton?\u201d I went on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI perfectly remembered her; the turn of her features, her olive complexion,\r\nand black hair, her height, her walk, her voice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton, of course,\u201d I pursued, \u201cwould be out of the question: and,\r\nindeed, as I saw your first interview with him, I am aware that he appeared to\r\nyou as a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat first night I was puzzled,\u201d she answered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did the recognition between him and your father come about?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey exchanged cards. The names Graham Bretton and Home de Bassompierre gave\r\nrise to questions and explanations. That was on the second day; but before then\r\nI was beginning to know something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2014know something?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d she said, \u201chow strange it is that most people seem so slow to feel the\r\ntruth\u2014not to see, but feel! When Dr. Bretton had visited me a few times,\r\nand sat near and talked to me; when I had observed the look in his eyes, the\r\nexpression about his mouth, the form of his chin, the carriage of his head, and\r\nall that we do observe in persons who approach us\u2014how could I avoid\r\nbeing led by association to think of Graham Bretton? Graham was slighter than\r\nhe, and not grown so tall, and had a smoother face, and longer and lighter\r\nhair, and spoke\u2014not so deeply\u2014more like a girl; but yet he is Graham,\r\njust as I am little Polly, or you are Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought the same, but I wondered to find my thoughts hers: there are certain\r\nthings in which we so rarely meet with our double that it seems a miracle when\r\nthat chance befalls.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou and Graham were once playmates.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you remember that?\u201d she questioned in her turn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt he will remember it also,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not asked him: few things would surprise me so much as to find that he\r\ndid. I suppose his disposition is still gay and careless?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it so formerly? Did it so strike you? Do you thus remember him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI scarcely remember him in any other light. Sometimes he was studious;\r\nsometimes he was merry: but whether busy with his books or disposed for play,\r\nit was chiefly the books or game he thought of; not much heeding those with\r\nwhom he read or amused himself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet to you he was partial.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPartial to me? Oh, no! he had other playmates\u2014his school-fellows; I was of\r\nlittle consequence to him, except on Sundays: yes, he was kind on Sundays. I\r\nremember walking with him hand-in-hand to St. Mary\u2019s, and his finding the\r\nplaces in my prayer-book; and how good and still he was on Sunday evenings! So\r\nmild for such a proud, lively boy; so patient with all my blunders in reading;\r\nand so wonderfully to be depended on, for he never spent those evenings from\r\nhome: I had a constant fear that he would accept some invitation and forsake\r\nus; but he never did, nor seemed ever to wish to do it. Thus, of course, it can\r\nbe no more. I suppose Sunday will now be Dr. Bretton\u2019s dining-out day\u2026.?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChildren, come down!\u201d here called Mrs. Bretton from below. Paulina would still\r\nhave lingered, but I inclined to descend: we went down.\r\n\n"}
{"26": "\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE LITTLE COUNTESS.\n\r\nCheerful as my godmother naturally was, and entertaining as, for our sakes, she\r\nmade a point of being, there was no true enjoyment that evening at La Terrasse,\r\ntill, through the wild howl of the winter-night, were heard the signal sounds\r\nof arrival. How often, while women and girls sit warm at snug fire-sides, their\r\nhearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding\r\ntheir persons, forced out by night to wander through dark ways, to dare stress\r\nof weather, to contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely gates and stiles\r\nin wildest storms, watching and listening to see and hear the father, the son,\r\nthe husband coming home.\r\n\n\r\nFather and son came at last to the ch\u00e2teau: for the Count de Bassompierre that\r\nnight accompanied Dr. Bretton. I know not which of our trio heard the horses\r\nfirst; the asperity, the violence of the weather warranted our running down\r\ninto the hall to meet and greet the two riders as they came in; but they warned\r\nus to keep our distance: both were white\u2014two mountains of snow; and indeed Mrs.\r\nBretton, seeing their condition, ordered them instantly to the kitchen;\r\nprohibiting them, at their peril, from setting foot on her carpeted staircase\r\ntill they had severally put off that mask of Old Christmas they now affected.\r\nInto the kitchen, however, we could not help following them: it was a large old\r\nDutch kitchen, picturesque and pleasant. The little white Countess danced in a\r\ncircle about her equally white sire, clapping her hands and crying, \u201cPapa,\r\npapa, you look like an enormous Polar bear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe bear shook himself, and the little sprite fled far from the frozen shower.\r\nBack she came, however, laughing, and eager to aid in removing the arctic\r\ndisguise. The Count, at last issuing from his dreadnought, threatened to\r\noverwhelm her with it as with an avalanche.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, then,\u201d said she, bending to invite the fall, and when it was playfully\r\nadvanced above her head, bounding out of reach like some little chamois.\r\n\n\r\nHer movements had the supple softness, the velvet grace of a kitten; her laugh\r\nwas clearer than the ring of silver and crystal; as she took her sire\u2019s cold\r\nhands and rubbed them, and stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a kiss, there\r\nseemed to shine round her a halo of loving delight. The grave and reverend\r\nseignor looked down on her as men do look on what is the apple of their\r\neye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bretton,\u201d said he: \u201cwhat am I to do with this daughter or daughterling of\r\nmine? She neither grows in wisdom nor in stature. Don\u2019t you find her pretty\r\nnearly as much the child as she was ten years ago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe cannot be more the child than this great boy of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton,\r\nwho was in conflict with her son about some change of dress she deemed\r\nadvisable, and which he resisted. He stood leaning against the Dutch dresser,\r\nlaughing and keeping her at arm\u2019s length.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, mamma,\u201d said he, \u201cby way of compromise, and to secure for us inward as\r\nwell as outward warmth, let us have a Christmas wassail-cup, and toast Old\r\nEngland here, on the hearth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo, while the Count stood by the fire, and Paulina Mary still danced to and\r\nfro\u2014happy in the liberty of the wide hall-like kitchen\u2014Mrs. Bretton herself\r\ninstructed Martha to spice and heat the wassail-bowl, and, pouring the draught\r\ninto a Bretton flagon, it was served round, reaming hot, by means of a small\r\nsilver vessel, which I recognised as Graham\u2019s christening-cup.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s to Auld Lang Syne!\u201d said the Count; holding the glancing cup on high.\r\nThen, looking at Mrs. Bretton.\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe twa ha\u2019 paidlet i\u2019 the burn\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fra morning sun till dine,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0But seas between us braid ha\u2019 roared\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sin\u2019 auld lang syne.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd surely ye\u2019ll be your pint-stoup,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And surely I\u2019ll be mine;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0And we\u2019ll taste a cup o\u2019 kindness yet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For auld lang syne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScotch! Scotch!\u201d cried Paulina; \u201cpapa is talking Scotch; and Scotch he is,\r\npartly. We are Home and de Bassompierre, Caledonian and Gallic.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that a Scotch reel you are dancing, you Highland fairy?\u201d asked her\r\nfather. \u201cMrs. Bretton, there will be a green ring growing up in the middle of\r\nyour kitchen shortly. I would not answer for her being quite cannie: she is a\r\nstrange little mortal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell Lucy to dance with me, papa; there is Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home (there was still quite as much about him of plain Mr. Home as of proud\r\nCount de Bassompierre) held his hand out to me, saying kindly, \u201che remembered\r\nme well; and, even had his own memory been less trustworthy, my name was so\r\noften on his daughter\u2019s lips, and he had listened to so many long tales about\r\nme, I should seem like an old acquaintance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEvery one now had tasted the wassail-cup except Paulina, whose pas de f\u00e9e, ou\r\nde fantaisie, nobody thought of interrupting to offer so profanatory a draught;\r\nbut she was not to be overlooked, nor baulked of her mortal privileges.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me taste,\u201d said she to Graham, as he was putting the cup on the shelf of\r\nthe dresser out of her reach.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton and Mr. Home were now engaged in conversation. Dr. John had not\r\nbeen unobservant of the fairy\u2019s dance; he had watched it, and he had liked it.\r\nTo say nothing of the softness and beauty of the movements, eminently grateful\r\nto his grace-loving eye, that ease in his mother\u2019s house charmed him, for it\r\nset him at ease: again she seemed a child for him\u2014again, almost his\r\nplaymate. I wondered how he would speak to her; I had not yet seen him address\r\nher; his first words proved that the old days of \u201clittle Polly\u201d had been\r\nrecalled to his mind by this evening\u2019s child-like light-heartedness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour ladyship wishes for the tankard?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I said so. I think I intimated as much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t consent to a step of the kind on any account. Sorry for it, but\r\ncouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? I am quite well now: it can\u2019t break my collar-bone again, or dislocate my\r\nshoulder. Is it wine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; nor dew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want dew; I don\u2019t like dew: but what is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAle\u2014strong ale\u2014old October; brewed, perhaps, when I was born.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt must be curious: is it good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcessively good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he took it down, administered to himself a second dose of this mighty\r\nelixir, expressed in his mischievous eyes extreme contentment with the same,\r\nand solemnly replaced the cup on the shelf.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should like a little,\u201d said Paulina, looking up; \u201cI never had any \u2018old\r\nOctober:\u2019 is it sweet?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerilously sweet,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nShe continued to look up exactly with the countenance of a child that longs for\r\nsome prohibited dainty. At last the Doctor relented, took it down, and indulged\r\nhimself in the gratification of letting her taste from his hand; his eyes,\r\nalways expressive in the revelation of pleasurable feelings, luminously and\r\nsmilingly avowed that it was a gratification; and he prolonged it by so\r\nregulating the position of the cup that only a drop at a time could reach the\r\nrosy, sipping lips by which its brim was courted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little more\u2014a little more,\u201d said she, petulantly touching his hand with the\r\nforefinger, to make him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly. \u201cIt\r\nsmells of spice and sugar, but I can\u2019t taste it; your wrist is so stiff, and\r\nyou are so stingy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe indulged her, whispering, however, with gravity: \u201cDon\u2019t tell my mother or\r\nLucy; they wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor do I,\u201d said she, passing into another tone and manner as soon as she had\r\nfairly assayed the beverage, just as if it had acted upon her like some\r\ndisenchanting draught, undoing the work of a wizard: \u201cI find it anything but\r\nsweet; it is bitter and hot, and takes away my breath. Your old October was\r\nonly desirable while forbidden. Thank you, no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd, with a slight bend\u2014careless, but as graceful as her dance\u2014she glided from\r\nhim and rejoined her father.\r\n\n\r\nI think she had spoken truth: the child of seven was in the girl of seventeen.\r\n\n\r\nGraham looked after her a little baffled, a little puzzled; his eye was on her\r\na good deal during the rest of the evening, but she did not seem to notice him.\r\n\n\r\nAs we ascended to the drawing-room for tea, she took her father\u2019s arm: her\r\nnatural place seemed to be at his side; her eyes and her ears were dedicated to\r\nhim. He and Mrs. Bretton were the chief talkers of our little party, and\r\nPaulina was their best listener, attending closely to all that was said,\r\nprompting the repetition of this or that trait or adventure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where were you at such a time, papa? And what did you say then? And tell\r\nMrs. Bretton what happened on that occasion.\u201d Thus she drew him out.\r\n\n\r\nShe did not again yield to any effervescence of glee; the infantine sparkle was\r\nexhaled for the night: she was soft, thoughtful, and docile. It was pretty to\r\nsee her bid good-night; her manner to Graham was touched with dignity: in her\r\nvery slight smile and quiet bow spoke the Countess, and Graham could not but\r\nlook grave, and bend responsive. I saw he hardly knew how to blend together in\r\nhis ideas the dancing fairy and delicate dame.\r\n\n\r\nNext day, when we were all assembled round the breakfast-table, shivering and\r\nfresh from the morning\u2019s chill ablutions, Mrs. Bretton pronounced a decree that\r\nnobody, who was not forced by dire necessity, should quit her house that day.\r\n\n\r\nIndeed, egress seemed next to impossible; the drift darkened the lower panes of\r\nthe casement, and, on looking out, one saw the sky and air vexed and dim, the\r\nwind and snow in angry conflict. There was no fall now, but what had already\r\ndescended was torn up from the earth, whirled round by brief shrieking gusts,\r\nand cast into a hundred fantastic forms.\r\n\n\r\nThe Countess seconded Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa shall not go out,\u201d said she, placing a seat for herself beside her\r\nfather\u2019s arm-chair. \u201cI will look after him. You won\u2019t go into town, will you,\r\npapa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, and No,\u201d was the answer. \u201cIf you and Mrs. Bretton are very good to\r\nme, Polly\u2014kind, you know, and attentive; if you pet me in a very nice manner,\r\nand make much of me, I may possibly be induced to wait an hour after breakfast\r\nand see whether this razor-edged wind settles. But, you see, you give me no\r\nbreakfast; you offer me nothing: you let me starve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuick! please, Mrs. Bretton, and pour out the coffee,\u201d entreated Paulina,\r\n\u201cwhilst I take care of the Count de Bassompierre in other respects: since he\r\ngrew into a Count, he has needed so much attention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe separated and prepared a roll.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, papa, are your \u2018pistolets\u2019 charged,\u201d said she. \u201cAnd there is some\r\nmarmalade, just the same sort of marmalade we used to have at Bretton, and\r\nwhich you said was as good as if it had been conserved in Scotland\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd which your little ladyship used to beg for my boy\u2014do you remember that?\u201d\r\ninterposed Mrs. Bretton. \u201cHave you forgotten how you would come to my elbow and\r\ntouch my sleeve with the whisper, \u2018Please, ma\u2019am, something good for Graham\u2014a\r\nlittle marmalade, or honey, or jam?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, mamma,\u201d broke in Dr. John, laughing, yet reddening; \u201cit surely was not so:\r\nI could not have cared for these things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he or did he not, Paulina?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe liked them,\u201d asserted Paulina.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever blush for it, John,\u201d said Mr. Home, encouragingly. \u201cI like them myself\r\nyet, and always did. And Polly showed her sense in catering for a friend\u2019s\r\nmaterial comforts: it was I who put her into the way of such good manners\u2014nor\r\ndo I let her forget them. Polly, offer me a small slice of that tongue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, papa: but remember you are only waited upon with this assiduity; on\r\ncondition of being persuadable, and reconciling yourself to La Terrasse for the\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bretton,\u201d said the Count, \u201cI want to get rid of my daughter\u2014to send her\r\nto school. Do you know of any good school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is Lucy\u2019s place\u2014Madame Beck\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe is in a school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a teacher,\u201d I said, and was rather glad of the opportunity of saying\r\nthis. For a little while I had been feeling as if placed in a false position.\r\nMrs. Bretton and son knew my circumstances; but the Count and his daughter did\r\nnot. They might choose to vary by some shades their hitherto cordial manner\r\ntowards me, when aware of my grade in society. I spoke then readily: but a\r\nswarm of thoughts I had not anticipated nor invoked, rose dim at the words,\r\nmaking me sigh involuntarily. Mr. Home did not lift his eyes from his\r\nbreakfast-plate for about two minutes, nor did he speak; perhaps he had not\r\ncaught the words\u2014perhaps he thought that on a confession of that nature,\r\npoliteness would interdict comment: the Scotch are proverbially proud; and\r\nhomely as was Mr. Home in look, simple in habits and tastes, I have all along\r\nintimated that he was not without his share of the national quality. Was his a\r\npseudo pride? was it real dignity? I leave the question undecided in its wide\r\nsense. Where it concerned me individually I can only answer: then, and always,\r\nhe showed himself a true-hearted gentleman.\r\n\n\r\nBy nature he was a feeler and a thinker; over his emotions and his reflections\r\nspread a mellowing of melancholy; more than a mellowing: in trouble and\r\nbereavement it became a cloud. He did not know much about Lucy Snowe; what he\r\nknew, he did not very accurately comprehend: indeed his misconceptions of my\r\ncharacter often made me smile; but he saw my walk in life lay rather on the\r\nshady side of the hill: he gave me credit for doing my endeavour to keep the\r\ncourse honestly straight; he would have helped me if he could: having no\r\nopportunity of helping, he still wished me well. When he did look at me, his\r\neye was kind; when he did speak, his voice was benevolent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYours,\u201d said he, \u201cis an arduous calling. I wish you health and strength to win\r\nin it\u2014success.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis fair little daughter did not take the information quite so composedly: she\r\nfixed on me a pair of eyes wide with wonder\u2014almost with dismay.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you a teacher?\u201d cried she. Then, having paused on the unpalatable idea,\r\n\u201cWell, I never knew what you were, nor ever thought of asking: for me, you were\r\nalways Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what am I now?\u201d I could not forbear inquiring.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYourself, of course. But do you really teach here, in Villette?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI really do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you like it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why do you go on with it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer father looked at, and, I feared, was going to check her; but he only said,\r\n\u201cProceed, Polly, proceed with that catechism\u2014prove yourself the little wiseacre\r\nyou are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused, I should have to bid\r\nyou hold your tongue; and you and I would sit out the present meal in some\r\ndisgrace; but she only smiles, so push her hard, multiply the cross-questions.\r\nWell, Miss Snowe, why do you go on with it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChiefly, I fear, for the sake of the money I get.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot then from motives of pure philanthropy? Polly and I were clinging to that\r\nhypothesis as the most lenient way of accounting for your eccentricity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014no, sir. Rather for the roof of shelter I am thus enabled to keep over my\r\nhead; and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that while I can work\r\nfor myself, I am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, say what you will, I pity Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake up that pity, Miss de Bassompierre; take it up in both hands, as you\r\nmight a little callow gosling squattering out of bounds without leave; put it\r\nback in the warm nest of a heart whence it issued, and receive in your ear this\r\nwhisper. If my Polly ever came to know by experience the uncertain nature of\r\nthis world\u2019s goods, I should like her to act as Lucy acts: to work for herself,\r\nthat she might burden neither kith nor kin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, papa,\u201d said she, pensively and tractably. \u201cBut poor Lucy! I thought she\r\nwas a rich lady, and had rich friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought like a little simpleton. I never thought so. When I had\r\ntime to consider Lucy\u2019s manner and aspect, which was not often, I saw she was\r\none who had to guard and not be guarded; to act and not be served: and this lot\r\nhas, I imagine, helped her to an experience for which, if she live long enough\r\nto realize its full benefit, she may yet bless Providence. But this school,\u201d he\r\npursued, changing his tone from grave to gay: \u201cwould Madame Beck admit my\r\nPolly, do you think, Miss Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, there needed but to try Madame; it would soon be seen: she was fond of\r\nEnglish pupils. \u201cIf you, sir,\u201d I added, \u201cwill but take Miss de Bassompierre in\r\nyour carriage this very afternoon, I think I can answer for it that Rosine, the\r\nportress, will not be very slow in answering your ring; and Madame, I am sure,\r\nwill put on her best pair of gloves to come into the salon to receive you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d responded Mr. Home, \u201cI see no sort of necessity there is for\r\ndelay. Mrs. Hurst can send what she calls her young lady\u2019s \u2018things\u2019 after her;\r\nPolly can settle down to her horn-book before night; and you, Miss Lucy, I\r\ntrust, will not disdain to cast an occasional eye upon her, and let me know,\r\nfrom time to time, how she gets on. I hope you approve of the arrangement,\r\nCountess de Bassompierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe Countess hemmed and hesitated. \u201cI thought,\u201d said she, \u201cI thought I had\r\nfinished my education\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat only proves how much we may be mistaken in our thoughts. I hold a far\r\ndifferent opinion, as most of these will who have been auditors of your\r\nprofound knowledge of life this morning. Ah, my little girl, thou hast much to\r\nlearn; and papa ought to have taught thee more than he has done! Come, there is\r\nnothing for it but to try Madame Beck; and the weather seems settling, and I\r\nhave finished my breakfast\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, papa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see an obstacle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is enormous, papa; it can never be got over; it is as large as you in your\r\ngreatcoat, and the snowdrift on the top.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd, like that snowdrift, capable of melting?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! it is of too\u2014too solid flesh: it is just your own self. Miss Lucy, warn\r\nMadame Beck not to listen to any overtures about taking me, because, in the\r\nend, it would turn out that she would have to take papa too: as he is so\r\nteasing, I will just tell tales about him. Mrs. Bretton and all of you listen:\r\nAbout five years ago, when I was twelve years old, he took it into his head\r\nthat he was spoiling me; that I was growing unfitted for the world, and I don\u2019t\r\nknow what, and nothing would serve or satisfy him, but I must go to school. I\r\ncried, and so on; but M. de Bassompierre proved hard-hearted, quite firm and\r\nflinty, and to school I went. What was the result? In the most admirable\r\nmanner, papa came to school likewise: every other day he called to see me.\r\nMadame Aigredoux grumbled, but it was of no use; and so, at last, papa and I\r\nwere both, in a manner, expelled. Lucy can just tell Madame Beck this little\r\ntrait: it is only fair to let her know what she has to expect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton asked Mr. Home what he had to say in answer to this statement. As\r\nhe made no defence, judgment was given against him, and Paulina triumphed.\r\n\n\r\nBut she had other moods besides the arch and na\u00efve. After breakfast; when the\r\ntwo elders withdrew\u2014I suppose to talk over certain of Mrs. Bretton\u2019s business\r\nmatters\u2014and the Countess, Dr. Bretton, and I, were for a short time alone\r\ntogether\u2014all the child left her; with us, more nearly her companions in age,\r\nshe rose at once to the little lady: her very face seemed to alter; that play\r\nof feature, and candour of look, which, when she spoke to her father, made it\r\nquite dimpled and round, yielded to an aspect more thoughtful, and lines\r\ndistincter and less mobile.\r\n\n\r\nNo doubt Graham noted the change as well as I. He stood for some minutes near\r\nthe window, looking out at the snow; presently he approached the hearth, and\r\nentered into conversation, but not quite with his usual ease: fit topics did\r\nnot seem to rise to his lips; he chose them fastidiously, hesitatingly, and\r\nconsequently infelicitously: he spoke vaguely of Villette\u2014its inhabitants, its\r\nnotable sights and buildings. He was answered by Miss de Bassompierre in quite\r\nwomanly sort; with intelligence, with a manner not indeed wholly\r\ndisindividualized: a tone, a glance, a gesture, here and there, rather animated\r\nand quick than measured and stately, still recalled little Polly; but yet there\r\nwas so fine and even a polish, so calm and courteous a grace, gilding and\r\nsustaining these peculiarities, that a less sensitive man than Graham would not\r\nhave ventured to seize upon them as vantage points, leading to franker\r\nintimacy.\r\n\n\r\nYet while Dr. Bretton continued subdued, and, for him, sedate, he was still\r\nobservant. Not one of those petty impulses and natural breaks escaped him. He\r\ndid not miss one characteristic movement, one hesitation in language, or one\r\nlisp in utterance. At times, in speaking fast, she still lisped; but coloured\r\nwhenever such lapse occurred, and in a painstaking, conscientious manner, quite\r\nas amusing as the slight error, repeated the word more distinctly.\r\n\n\r\nWhenever she did this, Dr. Bretton smiled. Gradually, as they conversed, the\r\nrestraint on each side slackened: might the conference have but been prolonged,\r\nI believe it would soon have become genial: already to Paulina\u2019s lip and cheek\r\nreturned the wreathing, dimpling smile; she lisped once, and forgot to correct\r\nherself. And Dr. John, I know not how he changed, but change he did. He\r\ndid not grow gayer\u2014no raillery, no levity sparkled across his aspect\u2014but his\r\nposition seemed to become one of more pleasure to himself, and he spoke his\r\naugmented comfort in readier language, in tones more suave. Ten years ago this\r\npair had always found abundance to say to each other; the intervening decade\r\nhad not narrowed the experience or impoverished the intelligence of either:\r\nbesides, there are certain natures of which the mutual influence is such, that\r\nthe more they say, the more they have to say. For these out of association\r\ngrows adhesion, and out of adhesion, amalgamation.\r\n\n\r\nGraham, however, must go: his was a profession whose claims are neither to be\r\nignored nor deferred. He left the room; but before he could leave the house\r\nthere was a return. I am sure he came back\u2014not for the paper, or card in his\r\ndesk, which formed his ostensible errand\u2014but to assure himself, by one more\r\nglance, that Paulina\u2019s aspect was really such as memory was bearing away: that\r\nhe had not been viewing her somehow by a partial, artificial light, and making\r\na fond mistake. No! he found the impression true\u2014rather, indeed, he gained than\r\nlost by this return: he took away with him a parting look\u2014shy, but very soft\u2014as\r\nbeautiful, as innocent, as any little fawn could lift out of its cover of fern,\r\nor any lamb from its meadow-bed.\r\n\n\r\nBeing left alone, Paulina and I kept silence for some time: we both took out\r\nsome work, and plied a mute and diligent task. The white-wood workbox of old\r\ndays was now replaced by one inlaid with precious mosaic, and furnished with\r\nimplements of gold; the tiny and trembling fingers that could scarce guide the\r\nneedle, though tiny still, were now swift and skilful: but there was the same\r\nbusy knitting of the brow, the same little dainty mannerisms, the same quick\r\nturns and movements\u2014now to replace a stray tress, and anon to shake from the\r\nsilken skirt some imaginary atom of dust\u2014some clinging fibre of thread.\r\n\n\r\nThat morning I was disposed for silence: the austere fury of the winter-day had\r\non me an awing, hushing influence. That passion of January, so white and so\r\nbloodless, was not yet spent: the storm had raved itself hoarse, but seemed no\r\nnearer exhaustion. Had Ginevra Fanshawe been my companion in that drawing-room,\r\nshe would not have suffered me to muse and listen undisturbed. The presence\r\njust gone from us would have been her theme; and how she would have rung the\r\nchanges on one topic! how she would have pursued and pestered me with questions\r\nand surmises\u2014worried and oppressed me with comments and confidences I did not\r\nwant, and longed to avoid.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina Mary cast once or twice towards me a quiet but penetrating glance of\r\nher dark, full eye; her lips half opened, as if to the impulse of coming\r\nutterance: but she saw and delicately respected my inclination for silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis will not hold long,\u201d I thought to myself; for I was not accustomed to\r\nfind in women or girls any power of self-control, or strength of self-denial.\r\nAs far as I knew them, the chance of a gossip about their usually trivial\r\nsecrets, their often very washy and paltry feelings, was a treat not to be\r\nreadily foregone.\r\n\n\r\nThe little Countess promised an exception: she sewed till she was tired of\r\nsewing, and then she took a book.\r\n\n\r\nAs chance would have it, she had sought it in Dr. Bretton\u2019s own compartment of\r\nthe bookcase; and it proved to be an old Bretton book\u2014some illustrated work of\r\nnatural history. Often had I seen her standing at Graham\u2019s side, resting that\r\nvolume on his knee, and reading to his tuition; and, when the lesson was over,\r\nbegging, as a treat, that he would tell her all about the pictures. I watched\r\nher keenly: here was a true test of that memory she had boasted; would her\r\nrecollections now be faithful?\r\n\n\r\nFaithful? It could not be doubted. As she turned the leaves, over her face\r\npassed gleam after gleam of expression, the least intelligent of which was a\r\nfull greeting to the Past. And then she turned to the title-page, and looked at\r\nthe name written in the schoolboy hand. She looked at it long; nor was she\r\nsatisfied with merely looking: she gently passed over the characters the tips\r\nof her fingers, accompanying the action with an unconscious but tender smile,\r\nwhich converted the touch into a caress. Paulina loved the Past; but the\r\npeculiarity of this little scene was, that she said nothing: she could\r\nfeel without pouring out her feelings in a flux of words.\r\n\n\r\nShe now occupied herself at the bookcase for nearly an hour; taking down volume\r\nafter volume, and renewing her acquaintance with each. This done, she seated\r\nherself on a low stool, rested her cheek on her hand, and thought, and still\r\nwas mute.\r\n\n\r\nThe sound of the front door opened below, a rush of cold wind, and her father\u2019s\r\nvoice speaking to Mrs. Bretton in the hall, startled her at last. She sprang\r\nup: she was down-stairs in one second.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa! papa! you are not going out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy pet, I must go into town.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut it is too\u2014too cold, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then I heard M. de Bassompierre showing to her how he was well provided\r\nagainst the weather; and how he was going to have the carriage, and to be quite\r\nsnugly sheltered; and, in short, proving that she need not fear for his\r\ncomfort.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will promise to come back here this evening, before it is quite\r\ndark;\u2014you and Dr. Bretton, both, in the carriage? It is not fit to ride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, if I see the Doctor, I will tell him a lady has laid on him her commands\r\nto take care of his precious health and come home early under my escort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, you must say a lady; and he will think it is his mother, and be obedient.\r\nAnd, papa, mind to come soon, for I shall watch and listen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe door closed, and the carriage rolled softly through the snow; and back\r\nreturned the Countess, pensive and anxious.\r\n\n\r\nShe did listen, and watch, when evening closed; but it was in stillest\r\nsort: walking the drawing-room with quite noiseless step. She checked at\r\nintervals her velvet march; inclined her ear, and consulted the night sounds: I\r\nshould rather say, the night silence; for now, at last, the wind was fallen.\r\nThe sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay naked and pale: through the barren\r\nboughs of the avenue we could see it well, and note also the polar splendour of\r\nthe new-year moon\u2014an orb white as a world of ice. Nor was it late when we saw\r\nalso the return of the carriage.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina had no dance of welcome for this evening. It was with a sort of gravity\r\nthat she took immediate possession of her father, as he entered the room; but\r\nshe at once made him her entire property, led him to the seat of her choice,\r\nand, while softly showering round him honeyed words of commendation for being\r\nso good and coming home so soon, you would have thought it was entirely by the\r\npower of her little hands he was put into his chair, and settled and arranged;\r\nfor the strong man seemed to take pleasure in wholly yielding himself to this\r\ndominion-potent only by love.\r\n\n\r\nGraham did not appear till some minutes after the Count. Paulina half turned\r\nwhen his step was heard: they spoke, but only a word or two; their fingers met\r\na moment, but obviously with slight contact. Paulina remained beside her\r\nfather; Graham threw himself into a seat on the other side of the room.\r\n\n\r\nIt was well that Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home had a great deal to say to each\r\nother\u2014almost an inexhaustible fund of discourse in old recollections;\r\notherwise, I think, our party would have been but a still one that evening.\r\n\n\r\nAfter tea, Paulina\u2019s quick needle and pretty golden thimble were busily plied\r\nby the lamp-light, but her tongue rested, and her eyes seemed reluctant to\r\nraise often their lids, so smooth and so full-fringed. Graham, too, must have\r\nbeen tired with his day\u2019s work: he listened dutifully to his elders and\r\nbetters, said very little himself, and followed with his eye the gilded glance\r\nof Paulina\u2019s thimble; as if it had been some bright moth on the wing, or the\r\ngolden head of some darting little yellow serpent.\r\n\n"}
{"27": "\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA BURIAL.\n\r\nFrom this date my life did not want variety; I went out a good deal, with the\r\nentire consent of Madame Beck, who perfectly approved the grade of my\r\nacquaintance. That worthy directress had never from the first treated me\r\notherwise than with respect; and when she found that I was liable to frequent\r\ninvitations from a ch\u00e2teau and a great hotel, respect improved into\r\ndistinction.\r\n\n\r\nNot that she was fulsome about it: Madame, in all things worldly, was in\r\nnothing weak; there was measure and sense in her hottest pursuit of\r\nself-interest, calm and considerateness in her closest clutch of gain; without,\r\nthen, laying herself open to my contempt as a time-server and a toadie, she\r\nmarked with tact that she was pleased people connected with her establishment\r\nshould frequent such associates as must cultivate and elevate, rather than\r\nthose who might deteriorate and depress. She never praised either me or my\r\nfriends; only once when she was sitting in the sun in the garden, a cup of\r\ncoffee at her elbow and the Gazette in her hand, looking very comfortable, and\r\nI came up and asked leave of absence for the evening, she delivered herself in\r\nthis gracious sort:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOui, oui, ma bonne amie: je vous donne la permission de c\u0153ur et de gr\u00e9. Votre\r\ntravail dans ma maison a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 admirable, rempli de z\u00e8le et de\r\ndiscr\u00e9tion: vous avez bien le droit de vous amuser. Sortez donc tant que vous\r\nvoudrez. Quant \u00e0 votre choix de connaissances, j\u2019en suis contente; c\u2019est sage,\r\ndigne, laudable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe closed her lips and resumed the Gazette.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader will not too gravely regard the little circumstance that about this\r\ntime the triply-enclosed packet of five letters temporarily disappeared from my\r\nbureau. Blank dismay was naturally my first sensation on making the discovery;\r\nbut in a moment I took heart of grace.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPatience!\u201d whispered I to myself. \u201cLet me say nothing, but wait peaceably;\r\nthey will come back again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd they did come back: they had only been on a short visit to Madame\u2019s\r\nchamber; having passed their examination, they came back duly and truly: I\r\nfound them all right the next day.\r\n\n\r\nI wonder what she thought of my correspondence? What estimate did she form of\r\nDr. John Bretton\u2019s epistolary powers? In what light did the often very pithy\r\nthoughts, the generally sound, and sometimes original opinions, set, without\r\npretension, in an easily-flowing, spirited style, appear to her? How did she\r\nlike that genial, half humorous vein, which to me gave such delight? What did\r\nshe think of the few kind words scattered here and there\u2014not thickly, as the\r\ndiamonds were scattered in the valley of Sindbad, but sparely, as those gems\r\nlie in unfabled beds? Oh, Madame Beck! how seemed these things to you?\r\n\n\r\nI think in Madame Beck\u2019s eyes the five letters found a certain favour. One day\r\nafter she had borrowed them of me (in speaking of so suave a little\r\nwoman, one ought to use suave terms), I caught her examining me with a steady\r\ncontemplative gaze, a little puzzled, but not at all malevolent. It was during\r\nthat brief space between lessons, when the pupils turned out into the court for\r\na quarter of an hour\u2019s recreation; she and I remained in the first classe\r\nalone: when I met her eye, her thoughts forced themselves partially through her\r\nlips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIl y a,\u201d said she, \u201cquelquechose de bien remarquable dans le caract\u00e8re\r\nAnglais.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow, Madame?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh, repeating the word \u201chow\u201d in English.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe ne saurais vous dire \u2018how;\u2019 mais, enfin, les Anglais ont des id\u00e9es \u00e0 eux,\r\nen amiti\u00e9, en amour, en tout. Mais au moins il n\u2019est pas besoin de les\r\nsurveiller,\u201d she added, getting up and trotting away like the compact little\r\npony she was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I hope,\u201d murmured I to myself, \u201cyou will graciously let alone my letters\r\nfor the future.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAlas! something came rushing into my eyes, dimming utterly their vision,\r\nblotting from sight the schoolroom, the garden, the bright winter sun, as I\r\nremembered that never more would letters, such as she had read, come to me. I\r\nhad seen the last of them. That goodly river on whose banks I had sojourned, of\r\nwhose waves a few reviving drops had trickled to my lips, was bending to\r\nanother course: it was leaving my little hut and field forlorn and sand-dry,\r\npouring its wealth of waters far away. The change was right, just, natural; not\r\na word could be said: but I loved my Rhine, my Nile; I had almost worshipped my\r\nGanges, and I grieved that the grand tide should roll estranged, should vanish\r\nlike a false mirage. Though stoical, I was not quite a stoic; drops streamed\r\nfast on my hands, on my desk: I wept one sultry shower, heavy and brief.\r\n\n\r\nBut soon I said to myself, \u201cThe Hope I am bemoaning suffered and made me suffer\r\nmuch: it did not die till it was full time: following an agony so lingering,\r\ndeath ought to be welcome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWelcome I endeavoured to make it. Indeed, long pain had made patience a habit.\r\nIn the end I closed the eyes of my dead, covered its face, and composed its\r\nlimbs with great calm.\r\n\n\r\nThe letters, however, must be put away, out of sight: people who have undergone\r\nbereavement always jealously gather together and lock away mementos: it is not\r\nsupportable to be stabbed to the heart each moment by sharp revival of regret.\r\n\n\r\nOne vacant holiday afternoon (the Thursday) going to my treasure, with intent\r\nto consider its final disposal, I perceived\u2014and this time with a strong impulse\r\nof displeasure\u2014that it had been again tampered with: the packet was there,\r\nindeed, but the ribbon which secured it had been untied and retied; and by\r\nother symptoms I knew that my drawer had been visited.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a little too much. Madame Beck herself was the soul of discretion,\r\nbesides having as strong a brain and sound a judgment as ever furnished a human\r\nhead; that she should know the contents of my casket, was not pleasant, but\r\nmight be borne. Little Jesuit inquisitress as she was, she could see things in\r\na true light, and understand them in an unperverted sense; but the idea that\r\nshe had ventured to communicate information, thus gained, to others; that she\r\nhad, perhaps, amused herself with a companion over documents, in my eyes most\r\nsacred, shocked me cruelly. Yet, that such was the case I now saw reason to\r\nfear; I even guessed her confidant. Her kinsman, M. Paul Emanuel, had spent\r\nyesterday evening with her: she was much in the habit of consulting him, and of\r\ndiscussing with him matters she broached to no one else. This very morning, in\r\nclass, that gentleman had favoured me with a glance which he seemed to have\r\nborrowed from Vashti, the actress; I had not at the moment comprehended that\r\nblue, yet lurid, flash out of his angry eye; but I read its meaning now.\r\nHe, I believed, was not apt to regard what concerned me from a fair\r\npoint of view, nor to judge me with tolerance and candour: I had always found\r\nhim severe and suspicious: the thought that these letters, mere friendly\r\nletters as they were, had fallen once, and might fall again, into his hands,\r\njarred my very soul.\r\n\n\r\nWhat should I do to prevent this? In what corner of this strange house was it\r\npossible to find security or secresy? Where could a key be a safeguard, or a\r\npadlock a barrier?\r\n\n\r\nIn the grenier? No, I did not like the grenier. Besides, most of the boxes and\r\ndrawers there were mouldering, and did not lock. Rats, too, gnawed their way\r\nthrough the decayed wood; and mice made nests amongst the litter of their\r\ncontents: my dear letters (most dear still, though Ichabod was written on their\r\ncovers) might be consumed by vermin; certainly the writing would soon become\r\nobliterated by damp. No; the grenier would not do\u2014but where then?\r\n\n\r\nWhile pondering this problem, I sat in the dormitory window-seat. It was a fine\r\nfrosty afternoon; the winter sun, already setting, gleamed pale on the tops of\r\nthe garden-shrubs in the \u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue.\u201d One great old pear-tree\u2014the nun\u2019s\r\npear-tree\u2014stood up a tall dryad skeleton, grey, gaunt, and stripped. A thought\r\nstruck me\u2014one of those queer fantastic thoughts that will sometimes strike\r\nsolitary people. I put on my bonnet, cloak, and furs, and went out into the\r\ncity.\r\n\n\r\nBending my steps to the old historical quarter of the town, whose hoar and\r\novershadowed precincts I always sought by instinct in melancholy moods, I\r\nwandered on from street to street, till, having crossed a half deserted \u201cplace\u201d\r\nor square, I found myself before a sort of broker\u2019s shop; an ancient place,\r\nfull of ancient things. What I wanted was a metal box which might be soldered,\r\nor a thick glass jar or bottle which might be stoppered or sealed hermetically.\r\nAmongst miscellaneous heaps, I found and purchased the latter article.\r\n\n\r\nI then made a little roll of my letters, wrapped them in oiled silk, bound them\r\nwith twine, and, having put them in the bottle, got the old Jew broker to\r\nstopper, seal, and make it air-tight. While obeying my directions, he glanced\r\nat me now and then suspiciously from under his frost-white eyelashes. I believe\r\nhe thought there was some evil deed on hand. In all this I had a dreary\r\nsomething\u2014not pleasure\u2014but a sad, lonely satisfaction. The impulse under which\r\nI acted, the mood controlling me, were similar to the impulse and the mood\r\nwhich had induced me to visit the confessional. With quick walking I regained\r\nthe pensionnat just at dark, and in time for dinner.\r\n\n\r\nAt seven o\u2019clock the moon rose. At half-past seven, when the pupils and\r\nteachers were at study, and Madame Beck was with her mother and children in the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger, when the half-boarders were all gone home, and Rosine had left\r\nthe vestibule, and all was still\u2014I shawled myself, and, taking the sealed jar,\r\nstole out through the first-classe door, into the berceau and thence into the\r\n\u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMethusaleh, the pear-tree, stood at the further end of this walk, near my seat:\r\nhe rose up, dim and gray, above the lower shrubs round him. Now Methusaleh,\r\nthough so very old, was of sound timber still; only there was a hole, or rather\r\na deep hollow, near his root. I knew there was such a hollow, hidden partly by\r\nivy and creepers growing thick round; and there I meditated hiding my treasure.\r\nBut I was not only going to hide a treasure\u2014I meant also to bury a grief. That\r\ngrief over which I had lately been weeping, as I wrapped it in its\r\nwinding-sheet, must be interred.\r\n\n\r\nWell, I cleared away the ivy, and found the hole; it was large enough to\r\nreceive the jar, and I thrust it deep in. In a tool-shed at the bottom of the\r\ngarden, lay the relics of building-materials, left by masons lately employed to\r\nrepair a part of the premises. I fetched thence a slate and some mortar, put\r\nthe slate on the hollow, secured it with cement, covered the hole with black\r\nmould, and, finally, replaced the ivy. This done, I rested, leaning against the\r\ntree; lingering, like any other mourner, beside a newly-sodded grave.\r\n\n\r\nThe air of the night was very still, but dim with a peculiar mist, which\r\nchanged the moonlight into a luminous haze. In this air, or this mist, there\r\nwas some quality\u2014electrical, perhaps\u2014which acted in strange sort upon me. I\r\nfelt then as I had felt a year ago in England\u2014on a night when the aurora\r\nborealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven, when, belated in lonely\r\nfields, I had paused to watch that mustering of an army with banners\u2014that\r\nquivering of serried lances\u2014that swift ascent of messengers from below the\r\nnorth star to the dark, high keystone of heaven\u2019s arch. I felt, not happy, far\r\notherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.\r\n\n\r\nIf life be a war, it seemed my destiny to conduct it single-handed. I pondered\r\nnow how to break up my winter-quarters\u2014to leave an encampment where food and\r\nforage failed. Perhaps, to effect this change, another pitched battle must be\r\nfought with fortune; if so, I had a mind to the encounter: too poor to lose,\r\nGod might destine me to gain. But what road was open?\u2014what plan available?\r\n\n\r\nOn this question I was still pausing, when the moon, so dim hitherto, seemed to\r\nshine out somewhat brighter: a ray gleamed even white before me, and a shadow\r\nbecame distinct and marked. I looked more narrowly, to make out the cause of\r\nthis well-defined contrast appearing a little suddenly in the obscure alley:\r\nwhiter and blacker it grew on my eye: it took shape with instantaneous\r\ntransformation. I stood about three yards from a tall, sable-robed,\r\nsnowy-veiled woman.\r\n\n\r\nFive minutes passed. I neither fled nor shrieked. She was there still. I spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho are you? and why do you come to me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stood mute. She had no face\u2014no features: all below her brow was masked with\r\na white cloth; but she had eyes, and they viewed me.\r\n\n\r\nI felt, if not brave, yet a little desperate; and desperation will often\r\nsuffice to fill the post and do the work of courage. I advanced one step. I\r\nstretched out my hand, for I meant to touch her. She seemed to recede. I drew\r\nnearer: her recession, still silent, became swift. A mass of shrubs,\r\nfull-leaved evergreens, laurel and dense yew, intervened between me and what I\r\nfollowed. Having passed that obstacle, I looked and saw nothing. I waited. I\r\nsaid,\u2014\u201cIf you have any errand to men, come back and deliver it.\u201d Nothing spoke\r\nor re-appeared.\r\n\n\r\nThis time there was no Dr. John to whom to have recourse: there was no one to\r\nwhom I dared whisper the words, \u201cI have again seen the nun.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPaulina Mary sought my frequent presence in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. In the old Bretton\r\ndays, though she had never professed herself fond of me, my society had soon\r\nbecome to her a sort of unconscious necessary. I used to notice that if I\r\nwithdrew to my room, she would speedily come trotting after me, and opening the\r\ndoor and peeping in, say, with her little peremptory accent,\u2014\u201cCome down. Why do\r\nyou sit here by yourself? You must come into the parlour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn the same spirit she urged me now\u2014\u201cLeave the Rue Fossette,\u201d she said, \u201cand\r\ncome and live with us. Papa would give you far more than Madame Beck gives\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home himself offered me a handsome sum\u2014thrice my present salary\u2014if I would\r\naccept the office of companion to his daughter. I declined. I think I should\r\nhave declined had I been poorer than I was, and with scantier fund of resource,\r\nmore stinted narrowness of future prospect. I had not that vocation. I could\r\nteach; I could give lessons; but to be either a private governess or a\r\ncompanion was unnatural to me. Rather than fill the former post in any great\r\nhouse, I would deliberately have taken a housemaid\u2019s place, bought a strong\r\npair of gloves, swept bedrooms and staircases, and cleaned stoves and locks, in\r\npeace and independence. Rather than be a companion, I would have made shirts\r\nand starved.\r\n\n\r\nI was no bright lady\u2019s shadow\u2014not Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s. Overcast enough it\r\nwas my nature often to be; of a subdued habit I was: but the dimness and\r\ndepression must both be voluntary\u2014such as kept me docile at my desk, in the\r\nmidst of my now well-accustomed pupils in Madame Beck\u2019s first classe; or alone,\r\nat my own bedside, in her dormitory, or in the alley and seat which were called\r\nmine, in her garden: my qualifications were not convertible, nor adaptable;\r\nthey could not be made the foil of any gem, the adjunct of any beauty, the\r\nappendage of any greatness in Christendom. Madame Beck and I, without\r\nassimilating, understood each other well. I was not her companion, nor\r\nher children\u2019s governess; she left me free: she tied me to nothing\u2014not to\r\nherself\u2014not even to her interests: once, when she had for a fortnight been\r\ncalled from home by a near relation\u2019s illness, and on her return, all anxious\r\nand full of care about her establishment, lest something in her absence should\r\nhave gone wrong finding that matters had proceeded much as usual, and that\r\nthere was no evidence of glaring neglect\u2014she made each of the teachers a\r\npresent, in acknowledgment of steadiness. To my bedside she came at twelve\r\no\u2019clock at night, and told me she had no present for me: \u201cI must make fidelity\r\nadvantageous to the St. Pierre,\u201d said she; \u201cif I attempt to make it\r\nadvantageous to you, there will arise misunderstanding between us\u2014perhaps\r\nseparation. One thing, however, I can do to please you\u2014leave you alone\r\nwith your liberty: c\u2019est-ce que je ferai.\u201d She kept her word. Every slight\r\nshackle she had ever laid on me, she, from that time, with quiet hand removed.\r\nThus I had pleasure in voluntarily respecting her rules: gratification in\r\ndevoting double time, in taking double pains with the pupils she committed to\r\nmy charge.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Mary de Bassompierre, I visited her with pleasure, though I would not\r\nlive with her. My visits soon taught me that it was unlikely even my occasional\r\nand voluntary society would long be indispensable to her. M. de Bassompierre,\r\nfor his part, seemed impervious to this conjecture, blind to this possibility;\r\nunconscious as any child to the signs, the likelihoods, the fitful beginnings\r\nof what, when it drew to an end, he might not approve.\r\n\n\r\nWhether or not he would cordially approve, I used to speculate. Difficult to\r\nsay. He was much taken up with scientific interests; keen, intent, and somewhat\r\noppugnant in what concerned his favourite pursuits, but unsuspicious and\r\ntrustful in the ordinary affairs of life. From all I could gather, he seemed to\r\nregard his \u201cdaughterling\u201d as still but a child, and probably had not yet\r\nadmitted the notion that others might look on her in a different light: he\r\nwould speak of what should be done when \u201cPolly\u201d was a woman, when she should be\r\ngrown up; and \u201cPolly,\u201d standing beside his chair, would sometimes smile and\r\ntake his honoured head between her little hands, and kiss his iron-grey locks;\r\nand, at other times, she would pout and toss her curls: but she never said,\r\n\u201cPapa, I am grown up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe had different moods for different people. With her father she really was\r\nstill a child, or child-like, affectionate, merry, and playful. With me she was\r\nserious, and as womanly as thought and feeling could make her. With Mrs.\r\nBretton she was docile and reliant, but not expansive. With Graham she was shy,\r\nat present very shy; at moments she tried to be cold; on occasion she\r\nendeavoured to shun him. His step made her start; his entrance hushed her; when\r\nhe spoke, her answers failed of fluency; when he took leave, she remained\r\nself-vexed and disconcerted. Even her father noticed this demeanour in her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little Polly,\u201d he said once, \u201cyou live too retired a life; if you grow to\r\nbe a woman with these shy manners, you will hardly be fitted for society. You\r\nreally make quite a stranger of Dr. Bretton: how is this? Don\u2019t you remember\r\nthat, as a little girl, you used to be rather partial to him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather, papa,\u201d echoed she, with her slightly dry, yet gentle and simple\r\ntone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like him now? What has he done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Y\u2014e\u2014s, I like him a little; but we are grown strange to each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen rub it off, Polly; rub the rust and the strangeness off. Talk away when\r\nhe is here, and have no fear of him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe does not talk much. Is he afraid of me, do you think, papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, to be sure, what man would not be afraid of such a little silent lady?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen tell him some day not to mind my being silent. Say that it is my way, and\r\nthat I have no unfriendly intention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour way, you little chatter-box? So far from being your way, it is only your\r\nwhim!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll improve, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd very pretty was the grace with which, the next day, she tried to keep her\r\nword. I saw her make the effort to converse affably with Dr. John on general\r\ntopics. The attention called into her guest\u2019s face a pleasurable glow; he met\r\nher with caution, and replied to her in his softest tones, as if there was a\r\nkind of gossamer happiness hanging in the air which he feared to disturb by\r\ndrawing too deep a breath. Certainly, in her timid yet earnest advance to\r\nfriendship, it could not be denied that there was a most exquisite and fairy\r\ncharm.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Doctor was gone, she approached her father\u2019s chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I keep my word, papa? Did I behave better?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Polly behaved like a queen. I shall become quite proud of her if this\r\nimprovement continues. By-and-by we shall see her receiving my guests with\r\nquite a calm, grand manner. Miss Lucy and I will have to look about us, and\r\npolish up all our best airs and graces lest we should be thrown into the shade.\r\nStill, Polly, there is a little flutter, a little tendency to stammer now and\r\nthen, and even, to lisp as you lisped when you were six years old.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa,\u201d interrupted she indignantly, \u201cthat can\u2019t be true.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI appeal to Miss Lucy. Did she not, in answering Dr. Bretton\u2019s question as to\r\nwhether she had ever seen the palace of the Prince of Bois l\u2019Etang, say,\r\n\u2018yeth,\u2019 she had been there \u2018theveral\u2019 times?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, you are satirical, you are m\u00e9chant! I can pronounce all the letters of\r\nthe alphabet as clearly as you can. But tell me this you are very particular in\r\nmaking me be civil to Dr. Bretton, do you like him yourself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure: for old acquaintance sake I like him: then he is a very good son\r\nto his mother; besides being a kind-hearted fellow and clever in his\r\nprofession: yes, the callant is well enough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCallant! Ah, Scotchman! Papa, is it the Edinburgh or the Aberdeen\r\naccent you have?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoth, my pet, both: and doubtless the Glaswegian into the bargain. It is that\r\nwhich enables me to speak French so well: a gude Scots tongue always succeeds\r\nwell at the French.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe French! Scotch again: incorrigible papa. You, too, need schooling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Polly, you must persuade Miss Snowe to undertake both you and me; to\r\nmake you steady and womanly, and me refined and classical.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe light in which M. de Bassompierre evidently regarded \u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d used to\r\noccasion me much inward edification. What contradictory attributes of character\r\nwe sometimes find ascribed to us, according to the eye with which we are\r\nviewed! Madame Beck esteemed me learned and blue; Miss Fanshawe, caustic,\r\nironic, and cynical; Mr. Home, a model teacher, the essence of the sedate and\r\ndiscreet: somewhat conventional, perhaps, too strict, limited, and scrupulous,\r\nbut still the pink and pattern of governess-correctness; whilst another person,\r\nProfessor Paul Emanuel, to wit, never lost an opportunity of intimating his\r\nopinion that mine was rather a fiery and rash nature\u2014adventurous, indocile, and\r\naudacious. I smiled at them all. If any one knew me it was little Paulina Mary.\r\n\n\r\nAs I would not be Paulina\u2019s nominal and paid companion, genial and harmonious\r\nas I began to find her intercourse, she persuaded me to join her in some study,\r\nas a regular and settled means of sustaining communication: she proposed the\r\nGerman language, which, like myself, she found difficult of mastery. We agreed\r\nto take our lessons in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy of the same mistress; this arrangement\r\nthrew us together for some hours of every week. M. de Bassompierre seemed quite\r\npleased: it perfectly met his approbation, that Madame Minerva Gravity should\r\nassociate a portion of her leisure with that of his fair and dear child.\r\n\n\r\nThat other self-elected judge of mine, the professor in the Rue Fossette,\r\ndiscovering by some surreptitious spying means, that I was no longer so\r\nstationary as hitherto, but went out regularly at certain hours of certain\r\ndays, took it upon himself to place me under surveillance. People said M.\r\nEmanuel had been brought up amongst Jesuits. I should more readily have\r\naccredited this report had his man\u0153uvres been better masked. As it was, I\r\ndoubted it. Never was a more undisguised schemer, a franker, looser intriguer.\r\nHe would analyze his own machinations: elaborately contrive plots, and\r\nforthwith indulge in explanatory boasts of their skill. I know not whether I\r\nwas more amused or provoked, by his stepping up to me one morning and\r\nwhispering solemnly that he \u201chad his eye on me: he at least would\r\ndischarge the duty of a friend, and not leave me entirely to my own devices. My\r\nproceedings seemed at present very unsettled: he did not know what to make of\r\nthem: he thought his cousin Beck very much to blame in suffering this sort of\r\nfluttering inconsistency in a teacher attached to her house. What had a person\r\ndevoted to a serious calling, that of education, to do with Counts and\r\nCountesses, hotels and ch\u00e2teaux? To him, I seemed altogether \u2018en l\u2019air.\u2019 On his\r\nfaith, he believed I went out six days in the seven.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, \u201cMonsieur exaggerated. I certainly had enjoyed the advantage of a\r\nlittle change lately, but not before it had become necessary; and the privilege\r\nwas by no means exercised in excess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNecessary! How was it necessary? I was well enough, he supposed? Change\r\nnecessary! He would recommend me to look at the Catholic \u2018religieuses,\u2019 and\r\nstudy their lives. They asked no change.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI am no judge of what expression crossed my face when he thus spoke, but it was\r\none which provoked him: he accused me of being reckless, worldly, and\r\nepicurean; ambitious of greatness, and feverishly athirst for the pomps and\r\nvanities of life. It seems I had no \u201cd\u00e9vouement,\u201d no \u201cr\u00e9cueillement\u201d in my\r\ncharacter; no spirit of grace, faith, sacrifice, or self-abasement. Feeling the\r\ninutility of answering these charges, I mutely continued the correction of a\r\npile of English exercises.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe could see in me nothing Christian: like many other Protestants, I revelled\r\nin the pride and self-will of paganism.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI slightly turned from him, nestling still closer under the wing of silence.\r\n\n\r\nA vague sound grumbled between his teeth; it could not surely be a \u201cjuron:\u201d he\r\nwas too religious for that; but I am certain I heard the word sacr\u00e9.\r\nGrievous to relate, the same word was repeated, with the unequivocal addition\r\nof mille something, when I passed him about two hours afterwards in the\r\ncorridor, prepared to go and take my German lesson in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. Never was\r\na better little man, in some points, than M. Paul: never, in others, a more\r\nwaspish little despot.\r\n\n\r\nOur German mistress, Fr\u00e4ulein Anna Braun, was a worthy, hearty woman, of about\r\nforty-five; she ought, perhaps, to have lived in the days of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nas she habitually consumed, for her first and second breakfasts, beer and beef:\r\nalso, her direct and downright Deutsch nature seemed to suffer a sensation of\r\ncruel restraint from what she called our English reserve; though we thought we\r\nwere very cordial with her: but we did not slap her on the shoulder, and if we\r\nconsented to kiss her cheek, it was done quietly, and without any explosive\r\nsmack. These omissions oppressed and depressed her considerably; still, on the\r\nwhole, we got on very well. Accustomed to instruct foreign girls, who hardly\r\never will think and study for themselves\u2014who have no idea of grappling with a\r\ndifficulty, and overcoming it by dint of reflection or application\u2014our\r\nprogress, which in truth was very leisurely, seemed to astound her. In her\r\neyes, we were a pair of glacial prodigies, cold, proud, and preternatural.\r\n\n\r\nThe young Countess was a little proud, a little fastidious: and perhaps,\r\nwith her native delicacy and beauty, she had a right to these feelings; but I\r\nthink it was a total mistake to ascribe them to me. I never evaded the morning\r\nsalute, which Paulina would slip when she could; nor was a certain little\r\nmanner of still disdain a weapon known in my armoury of defence; whereas,\r\nPaulina always kept it clear, fine, and bright, and any rough German sally\r\ncalled forth at once its steelly glisten.\r\n\n\r\nHonest Anna Braun, in some measure, felt this difference; and while she\r\nhalf-feared, half-worshipped Paulina, as a sort of dainty nymph\u2014an Undine\u2014she\r\ntook refuge with me, as a being all mortal, and of easier mood.\r\n\n\r\nA book we liked well to read and translate was Schiller\u2019s Ballads; Paulina soon\r\nlearned to read them beautifully; the Fr\u00e4ulein would listen to her with a broad\r\nsmile of pleasure, and say her voice sounded like music. She translated them,\r\ntoo, with a facile flow of language, and in a strain of kindred and poetic\r\nfervour: her cheek would flush, her lips tremblingly smile, her beauteous eyes\r\nkindle or melt as she went on. She learnt the best by heart, and would often\r\nrecite them when we were alone together. One she liked well was \u201cDes M\u00e4dchens\r\nKlage:\u201d that is, she liked well to repeat the words, she found plaintive melody\r\nin the sound; the sense she would criticise. She murmured, as we sat over the\r\nfire one evening:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nDu Heilige, rufe dein Kind zur\u00fcck,\r\nIch habe genossen das irdische Gl\u00fcck,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ich habe gelebt und geliebet!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLived and loved!\u201d said she, \u201cis that the summit of earthly happiness, the end\r\nof life\u2014to love? I don\u2019t think it is. It may be the extreme of mortal misery,\r\nit may be sheer waste of time, and fruitless torture of feeling. If Schiller\r\nhad said to be loved, he might have come nearer the truth. Is not that\r\nanother thing, Lucy, to be loved?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it may be: but why consider the subject? What is love to you? What\r\ndo you know about it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe crimsoned, half in irritation, half in shame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Lucy,\u201d she said, \u201cI won\u2019t take that from you. It may be well for papa to\r\nlook on me as a baby: I rather prefer that he should thus view me; but\r\nyou know and shall learn to acknowledge that I am verging on my\r\nnineteenth year.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo matter if it were your twenty-ninth; we will anticipate no feelings by\r\ndiscussion and conversation; we will not talk about love.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed!\u201d said she\u2014all in hurry and heat\u2014\u201cyou may think to check and\r\nhold me in, as much as you please; but I have talked about it, and heard\r\nabout it too; and a great deal and lately, and disagreeably and detrimentally:\r\nand in a way you wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the vexed, triumphant, pretty, naughty being laughed. I could not discern\r\nwhat she meant, and I would not ask her: I was nonplussed. Seeing, however, the\r\nutmost innocence in her countenance\u2014combined with some transient perverseness\r\nand petulance\u2014I said at last,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on such matters? Who that has\r\nnear access to you would dare to do it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d replied she more softly, \u201cit is a person who makes me miserable\r\nsometimes; and I wish she would keep away\u2014I don\u2019t want her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut who, Paulina, can it be? You puzzle me much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is\u2014it is my cousin Ginevra. Every time she has leave to visit Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley she calls here, and whenever she finds me alone she begins to talk\r\nabout her admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear all she has to say about\r\nlove.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard it,\u201d said I, quite coolly; \u201cand on the whole, perhaps it is\r\nas well you should have heard it too: it is not to be regretted, it is all\r\nright. Yet, surely, Ginevra\u2019s mind cannot influence yours. You can look over\r\nboth her head and her heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe does influence me very much. She has the art of disturbing my happiness\r\nand unsettling my opinions. She hurts me through the feelings and people\r\ndearest to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does she say, Paulina? Give me some idea. There may be counteraction of\r\nthe damage done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe people I have longest and most esteemed are degraded by her. She does not\r\nspare Mrs. Bretton\u2014she does not spare\u2026. Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, I daresay: and how does she mix up these with her sentiment and\r\nher\u2026.love? She does mix them, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, she is insolent; and, I believe, false. You know Dr. Bretton. We both\r\nknow him. He may be careless and proud; but when was he ever mean or slavish?\r\nDay after day she shows him to me kneeling at her feet, pursuing her like her\r\nshadow. She\u2014repulsing him with insult, and he imploring her with infatuation.\r\nLucy, is it true? Is any of it true?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt may be true that he once thought her handsome: does she give him out as\r\nstill her suitor?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe says she might marry him any day: he only waits her consent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is these tales which have caused that reserve in your manner towards Graham\r\nwhich your father noticed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have certainly made me all doubtful about his character. As Ginevra\r\nspeaks, they do not carry with them the sound of unmixed truth: I believe she\r\nexaggerates\u2014perhaps invents\u2014but I want to know how far.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we bring Miss Fanshawe to some proof. Give her an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying the power she boasts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could do that to-morrow. Papa has asked some gentlemen to dinner, all\r\nsavants. Graham, who, papa is beginning to discover, is a savant, too\u2014skilled,\r\nthey say, in more than one branch of science\u2014is among the number. Now I should\r\nbe miserable to sit at table unsupported, amidst such a party. I could not talk\r\nto Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and Z\u2014\u2014, the Parisian Academicians: all my new credit for\r\nmanner would be put in peril. You and Mrs. Bretton must come for my sake;\r\nGinevra, at a word, will join you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; then I will carry a message of invitation, and she shall have the chance\r\nof justifying her character for veracity.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"28": "\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nTHE H\u00d4TEL CR\u00c9CY.\n\r\nThe morrow turned out a more lively and busy day than we\u2014or than I, at\r\nleast\u2014had anticipated. It seems it was the birthday of one of the young princes\r\nof Labassecour\u2014the eldest, I think, the Duc de Dindonneau, and a general\r\nholiday was given in his honour at the schools, and especially at the principal\r\n\u201cAth\u00e9n\u00e9e,\u201d or college. The youth of that institution had also concocted, and\r\nwere to present a loyal address; for which purpose they were to be assembled in\r\nthe public building where the yearly examinations were conducted, and the\r\nprizes distributed. After the ceremony of presentation, an oration, or\r\n\u201cdiscours,\u201d was to follow from one of the professors.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral of M. de Bassompierre\u2019s friends\u2014the savants\u2014being more or less\r\nconnected with the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, they were expected to attend on this occasion;\r\ntogether with the worshipful municipality of Villette, M. le Chevalier Staas,\r\nthe burgomaster, and the parents and kinsfolk of the Athenians in general. M.\r\nde Bassompierre was engaged by his friends to accompany them; his fair daughter\r\nwould, of course, be of the party, and she wrote a little note to Ginevra and\r\nmyself, bidding us come early that we might join her.\r\n\n\r\nAs Miss Fanshawe and I were dressing in the dormitory of the Rue Fossette, she\r\n(Miss F.) suddenly burst into a laugh.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked; for she had suspended the operation of arranging her\r\nattire, and was gazing at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so odd,\u201d she replied, with her usual half-honest half-insolent\r\nunreserve, \u201cthat you and I should now be so much on a level, visiting in the\r\nsame sphere; having the same connections.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said I; \u201cI had not much respect for the connections you chiefly\r\nfrequented awhile ago: Mrs. Cholmondeley and Co. would never have suited me at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, Miss Snowe?\u201d she inquired, in a tone of such undisguised\r\nand unsophisticated curiosity, as made me laugh in my turn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou used to call yourself a nursery governess; when you first came here you\r\nreally had the care of the children in this house: I have seen you carry little\r\nGeorgette in your arms, like a bonne\u2014few governesses would have condescended so\r\nfar\u2014and now Madame Beck treats you with more courtesy than she treats the\r\nParisienne, St. Pierre; and that proud chit, my cousin, makes you her bosom\r\nfriend!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d I agreed, much amused at her mystification. \u201cWho am I indeed?\r\nPerhaps a personage in disguise. Pity I don\u2019t look the character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder you are not more flattered by all this,\u201d she went on; \u201cyou take it\r\nwith strange composure. If you really are the nobody I once thought you, you\r\nmust be a cool hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe nobody you once thought me!\u201d I repeated, and my face grew a little hot;\r\nbut I would not be angry: of what importance was a school-girl\u2019s crude use of\r\nthe terms nobody and somebody? I confined myself, therefore, to the remark that\r\nI had merely met with civility; and asked \u201cwhat she saw in civility to throw\r\nthe recipient into a fever of confusion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne can\u2019t help wondering at some things,\u201d she persisted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWondering at marvels of your own manufacture. Are you ready at last?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; let me take your arm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather not: we will walk side by side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen she took my arm, she always leaned upon me her whole weight; and, as I was\r\nnot a gentleman, or her lover, I did not like it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, again!\u201d she cried. \u201cI thought, by offering to take your arm, to\r\nintimate approbation of your dress and general appearance: I meant it as a\r\ncompliment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did? You meant, in short, to express that you are not ashamed to be seen\r\nin the street with me? That if Mrs. Cholmondeley should be fondling her lapdog\r\nat some window, or Colonel de Hamal picking his teeth in a balcony, and should\r\ncatch a glimpse of us, you would not quite blush for your companion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said she, with that directness which was her best point\u2014which gave an\r\nhonest plainness to her very fibs when she told them\u2014which was, in short, the\r\nsalt, the sole preservative ingredient of a character otherwise not formed to\r\nkeep.\r\n\n\r\nI delegated the trouble of commenting on this \u201cyes\u201d to my countenance; or\r\nrather, my under-lip voluntarily anticipated my tongue of course, reverence and\r\nsolemnity were not the feelings expressed in the look I gave her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScornful, sneering creature!\u201d she went on, as we crossed a great square, and\r\nentered the quiet, pleasant park, our nearest way to the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. \u201cNobody in\r\nthis world was ever such a Turk to me as you are!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou bring it on yourself: let me alone: have the sense to be quiet: I will let\r\nyou alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if one could let you alone, when you are so peculiar and so\r\nmysterious!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe mystery and peculiarity being entirely the conception of your own\r\nbrain\u2014maggots\u2014neither more nor less, be so good as to keep them out of my\r\nsight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut are you anybody?\u201d persevered she, pushing her hand, in spite of me,\r\nunder my arm; and that arm pressed itself with inhospitable closeness against\r\nmy side, by way of keeping out the intruder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI am a rising character: once an old lady\u2019s companion, then a\r\nnursery-governess, now a school-teacher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo\u2014do tell me who you are? I\u2019ll not repeat it,\u201d she urged, adhering\r\nwith ludicrous tenacity to the wise notion of an incognito she had got hold of;\r\nand she squeezed the arm of which she had now obtained full possession, and\r\ncoaxed and conjured till I was obliged to pause in the park to laugh.\r\nThroughout our walk she rang the most fanciful changes on this theme; proving,\r\nby her obstinate credulity, or incredulity, her incapacity to conceive how any\r\nperson not bolstered up by birth or wealth, not supported by some consciousness\r\nof name or connection, could maintain an attitude of reasonable integrity. As\r\nfor me, it quite sufficed to my mental tranquillity that I was known where it\r\nimported that known I should be; the rest sat on me easily: pedigree, social\r\nposition, and recondite intellectual acquisition, occupied about the same space\r\nand place in my interests and thoughts; they were my third-class lodgers\u2014to\r\nwhom could be assigned only the small sitting-room and the little back bedroom:\r\neven if the dining and drawing-rooms stood empty, I never confessed it to them,\r\nas thinking minor accommodations better suited to their circumstances. The\r\nworld, I soon learned, held a different estimate: and I make no doubt, the\r\nworld is very right in its view, yet believe also that I am not quite wrong in\r\nmine.\r\n\n\r\nThere are people whom a lowered position degrades morally, to whom loss of\r\nconnection costs loss of self-respect: are not these justified in placing the\r\nhighest value on that station and association which is their safeguard from\r\ndebasement? If a man feels that he would become contemptible in his own eyes\r\nwere it generally known that his ancestry were simple and not gentle, poor and\r\nnot rich, workers and not capitalists, would it be right severely to blame him\r\nfor keeping these fatal facts out of sight\u2014for starting, trembling, quailing at\r\nthe chance which threatens exposure? The longer we live, the more our\r\nexperience widens; the less prone are we to judge our neighbour\u2019s conduct, to\r\nquestion the world\u2019s wisdom: wherever an accumulation of small defences is\r\nfound, whether surrounding the prude\u2019s virtue or the man of the world\u2019s\r\nrespectability, there, be sure, it is needed.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy; Paulina was ready; Mrs. Bretton was with her; and,\r\nunder her escort and that of M. de Bassompierre, we were soon conducted to the\r\nplace of assembly, and seated in good seats, at a convenient distance from the\r\nTribune. The youth of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e were marshalled before us, the municipality\r\nand their bourgmestre were in places of honour, the young princes, with their\r\ntutors, occupied a conspicuous position, and the body of the building was\r\ncrowded with the aristocracy and first burghers of the town.\r\n\n\r\nConcerning the identity of the professor by whom the \u201cdiscours\u201d was to be\r\ndelivered, I had as yet entertained neither care nor question. Some vague\r\nexpectation I had that a savant would stand up and deliver a formal speech,\r\nhalf dogmatism to the Athenians, half flattery to the princes.\r\n\n\r\nThe Tribune was yet empty when we entered, but in ten minutes after it was\r\nfilled; suddenly, in a second of time, a head, chest, and arms grew above the\r\ncrimson desk. This head I knew: its colour, shape, port, expression, were\r\nfamiliar both to me and Miss Fanshawe; the blackness and closeness of cranium,\r\nthe amplitude and paleness of brow, the blueness and fire of glance, were\r\ndetails so domesticated in the memory, and so knit with many a whimsical\r\nassociation, as almost by this their sudden apparition, to tickle fancy to a\r\nlaugh. Indeed, I confess, for my part, I did laugh till I was warm; but then I\r\nbent my head, and made my handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants\r\nof my mirth.\r\n\n\r\nI think I was glad to see M. Paul; I think it was rather pleasant than\r\notherwise, to behold him set up there, fierce and frank, dark and candid, testy\r\nand fearless, as when regnant on his estrade in class. His presence was such a\r\nsurprise: I had not once thought of expecting him, though I knew he filled the\r\nchair of Belles Lettres in the college. With him in that Tribune, I felt\r\nsure that neither formalism nor flattery would be our doom; but for what was\r\nvouchsafed us, for what was poured suddenly, rapidly, continuously, on our\r\nheads\u2014I own I was not prepared.\r\n\n\r\nHe spoke to the princes, the nobles, the magistrates, and the burghers, with\r\njust the same ease, with almost the same pointed, choleric earnestness, with\r\nwhich he was wont to harangue the three divisions of the Rue Fossette. The\r\ncollegians he addressed, not as schoolboys, but as future citizens and embryo\r\npatriots. The times which have since come on Europe had not been foretold yet,\r\nand M. Emanuel\u2019s spirit seemed new to me. Who would have thought the flat and\r\nfat soil of Labassecour could yield political convictions and national\r\nfeelings, such as were now strongly expressed? Of the bearing of his opinions I\r\nneed here give no special indication; yet it may be permitted me to say that I\r\nbelieved the little man not more earnest than right in what he said: with all\r\nhis fire he was severe and sensible; he trampled Utopian theories under his\r\nheel; he rejected wild dreams with scorn;\u2014but when he looked in the face of\r\ntyranny\u2014oh, then there opened a light in his eye worth seeing; and when he\r\nspoke of injustice, his voice gave no uncertain sound, but reminded me rather\r\nof the band-trumpet, ringing at twilight from the park.\r\n\n\r\nI do not think his audience were generally susceptible of sharing his flame in\r\nits purity; but some of the college youth caught fire as he eloquently told\r\nthem what should be their path and endeavour in their country\u2019s and in Europe\u2019s\r\nfuture. They gave him a long, loud, ringing cheer, as he concluded: with all\r\nhis fierceness, he was their favourite professor.\r\n\n\r\nAs our party left the Hall, he stood at the entrance; he saw and knew me, and\r\nlifted his hat; he offered his hand in passing, and uttered the words \u201cQu\u2019en\r\ndites vous?\u201d\u2014question eminently characteristic, and reminding me, even in this\r\nhis moment of triumph, of that inquisitive restlessness, that absence of what I\r\nconsidered desirable self-control, which were amongst his faults. He should not\r\nhave cared just then to ask what I thought, or what anybody thought, but he\r\ndid care, and he was too natural to conceal, too impulsive to repress\r\nhis wish. Well! if I blamed his over-eagerness, I liked his naivet\u00e9. I\r\nwould have praised him: I had plenty of praise in my heart; but, alas! no words\r\non my lips. Who has words at the right moment? I stammered some lame\r\nexpressions; but was truly glad when other people, coming up with profuse\r\ncongratulations, covered my deficiency by their redundancy.\r\n\n\r\nA gentleman introduced him to M. de Bassompierre; and the Count, who had\r\nlikewise been highly gratified, asked him to join his friends (for the most\r\npart M. Emanuel\u2019s likewise), and to dine with them at the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy. He\r\ndeclined dinner, for he was a man always somewhat shy at meeting the advances\r\nof the wealthy: there was a strength of sturdy independence in the stringing of\r\nhis sinews\u2014not obtrusive, but pleasant enough to discover as one advanced in\r\nknowledge of his character; he promised, however, to step in with his friend,\r\nM. A\u2014\u2014, a French Academician, in the course of the evening.\r\n\n\r\nAt dinner that day, Ginevra and Paulina each looked, in her own way, very\r\nbeautiful; the former, perhaps, boasted the advantage in material charms, but\r\nthe latter shone pre-eminent for attractions more subtle and spiritual: for\r\nlight and eloquence of eye, for grace of mien, for winning variety of\r\nexpression. Ginevra\u2019s dress of deep crimson relieved well her light curls, and\r\nharmonized with her rose-like bloom. Paulina\u2019s attire\u2014in fashion close, though\r\nfaultlessly neat, but in texture clear and white\u2014made the eye grateful for the\r\ndelicate life of her complexion, for the soft animation of her countenance, for\r\nthe tender depth of her eyes, for the brown shadow and bounteous flow of her\r\nhair\u2014darker than that of her Saxon cousin, as were also her eyebrows, her\r\neyelashes, her full irids, and large mobile pupils. Nature having traced all\r\nthese details slightly, and with a careless hand, in Miss Fanshawe\u2019s case; and\r\nin Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s, wrought them to a high and delicate finish.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina was awed by the savants, but not quite to mutism: she conversed\r\nmodestly, diffidently; not without effort, but with so true a sweetness, so\r\nfine and penetrating a sense, that her father more than once suspended his own\r\ndiscourse to listen, and fixed on her an eye of proud delight. It was a polite\r\nFrenchman, M. Z\u2014\u2014, a very learned, but quite a courtly man, who had drawn her\r\ninto discourse. I was charmed with her French; it was faultless\u2014the structure\r\ncorrect, the idioms true, the accent pure; Ginevra, who had lived half her life\r\non the Continent, could do nothing like it not that words ever failed Miss\r\nFanshawe, but real accuracy and purity she neither possessed, nor in any number\r\nof years would acquire. Here, too, M. de Bassompierre was gratified; for, on\r\nthe point of language, he was critical.\r\n\n\r\nAnother listener and observer there was; one who, detained by some exigency of\r\nhis profession, had come in late to dinner. Both ladies were quietly scanned by\r\nDr. Bretton, at the moment of taking his seat at the table; and that guarded\r\nsurvey was more than once renewed. His arrival roused Miss Fanshawe, who had\r\nhitherto appeared listless: she now became smiling and complacent,\r\ntalked\u2014though what she said was rarely to the purpose\u2014or rather, was of a\r\npurpose somewhat mortifyingly below the standard of the occasion. Her light,\r\ndisconnected prattle might have gratified Graham once; perhaps it pleased him\r\nstill: perhaps it was only fancy which suggested the thought that, while his\r\neye was filled and his ear fed, his taste, his keen zest, his lively\r\nintelligence, were not equally consulted and regaled. It is certain that,\r\nrestless and exacting as seemed the demand on his attention, he yielded\r\ncourteously all that was required: his manner showed neither pique nor\r\ncoolness: Ginevra was his neighbour, and to her, during dinner, he almost\r\nexclusively confined his notice. She appeared satisfied, and passed to the\r\ndrawing-room in very good spirits.\r\n\n\r\nYet, no sooner had we reached that place of refuge, than she again became flat\r\nand listless: throwing herself on a couch, she denounced both the \u201cdiscours\u201d\r\nand the dinner as stupid affairs, and inquired of her cousin how she could hear\r\nsuch a set of prosaic \u201cgros-bonnets\u201d as her father gathered about him. The\r\nmoment the gentlemen were heard to move, her railings ceased: she started up,\r\nflew to the piano, and dashed at it with spirit. Dr. Bretton entering, one of\r\nthe first, took up his station beside her. I thought he would not long maintain\r\nthat post: there was a position near the hearth to which I expected to see him\r\nattracted: this position he only scanned with his eye; while he looked,\r\nothers drew in. The grace and mind of Paulina charmed these thoughtful\r\nFrenchmen: the fineness of her beauty, the soft courtesy of her manner, her\r\nimmature, but real and inbred tact, pleased their national taste; they\r\nclustered about her, not indeed to talk science; which would have rendered her\r\ndumb, but to touch on many subjects in letters, in arts, in actual life, on\r\nwhich it soon appeared that she had both read and reflected. I listened. I am\r\nsure that though Graham stood aloof, he listened too: his hearing as well as\r\nhis vision was very fine, quick, discriminating. I knew he gathered the\r\nconversation; I felt that the mode in which it was sustained suited him\r\nexquisitely\u2014pleased him almost to pain.\r\n\n\r\nIn Paulina there was more force, both of feeling and character; than most\r\npeople thought\u2014than Graham himself imagined\u2014than she would ever show to those\r\nwho did not wish to see it. To speak truth, reader, there is no excellent\r\nbeauty, no accomplished grace, no reliable refinement, without strength as\r\nexcellent, as complete, as trustworthy. As well might you look for good fruit\r\nand blossom on a rootless and sapless tree, as for charms that will endure in a\r\nfeeble and relaxed nature. For a little while, the blooming semblance of beauty\r\nmay flourish round weakness; but it cannot bear a blast: it soon fades, even in\r\nserenest sunshine. Graham would have started had any suggestive spirit\r\nwhispered of the sinew and the stamina sustaining that delicate nature; but I\r\nwho had known her as a child, knew or guessed by what a good and strong root\r\nher graces held to the firm soil of reality.\r\n\n\r\nWhile Dr. Bretton listened, and waited an opening in the magic circle, his\r\nglance restlessly sweeping the room at intervals, lighted by chance on me,\r\nwhere I sat in a quiet nook not far from my godmother and M. de Bassompierre,\r\nwho, as usual, were engaged in what Mr. Home called \u201ca two-handed crack:\u201d what\r\nthe Count would have interpreted as a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Graham smiled recognition,\r\ncrossed the room, asked me how I was, told me I looked pale. I also had my own\r\nsmile at my own thought: it was now about three months since Dr. John had\r\nspoken to me\u2014a lapse of which he was not even conscious. He sat down, and\r\nbecame silent. His wish was rather to look than converse. Ginevra and Paulina\r\nwere now opposite to him: he could gaze his fill: he surveyed both\r\nforms\u2014studied both faces.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral new guests, ladies as well as gentlemen, had entered the room since\r\ndinner, dropping in for the evening conversation; and amongst the gentlemen, I\r\nmay incidentally observe, I had already noticed by glimpses, a severe, dark,\r\nprofessorial outline, hovering aloof in an inner saloon, seen only in vista. M.\r\nEmanuel knew many of the gentlemen present, but I think was a stranger to most\r\nof the ladies, excepting myself; in looking towards the hearth, he could not\r\nbut see me, and naturally made a movement to approach; seeing, however, Dr.\r\nBretton also, he changed his mind and held back. If that had been all, there\r\nwould have been no cause for quarrel; but not satisfied with holding back, he\r\npuckered up his eyebrows, protruded his lip, and looked so ugly that I averted\r\nmy eyes from the displeasing spectacle. M. Joseph Emanuel had arrived, as well\r\nas his austere brother, and at this very moment was relieving Ginevra at the\r\npiano. What a master-touch succeeded her school-girl jingle! In what grand,\r\ngrateful tones the instrument acknowledged the hand of the true artist!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d began Dr. Bretton, breaking silence and smiling, as Ginevra glided\r\nbefore him, casting a glance as she passed by, \u201cMiss Fanshawe is certainly a\r\nfine girl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course I assented.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there,\u201d he pursued, \u201canother in the room as lovely?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think there is not another as handsome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you, Lucy: you and I do often agree in opinion, in taste, I\r\nthink; or at least in judgment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo we?\u201d I said, somewhat doubtfully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl\u2014my mother\u2019s god-son\r\ninstead of her god-daughter, we should have been good friends: our opinions\r\nwould have melted into each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe had assumed a bantering air: a light, half-caressing, half-ironic, shone\r\naslant in his eye. Ah, Graham! I have given more than one solitary moment to\r\nthoughts and calculations of your estimate of Lucy Snowe: was it always kind or\r\njust? Had Lucy been intrinsically the same but possessing the additional\r\nadvantages of wealth and station, would your manner to her, your value for her,\r\nhave been quite what they actually were? And yet by these questions I would not\r\nseriously infer blame. No; you might sadden and trouble me sometimes; but then\r\nmine was a soon-depressed, an easily-deranged temperament\u2014it fell if a cloud\r\ncrossed the sun. Perhaps before the eye of severe equity I should stand more at\r\nfault than you.\r\n\n\r\nTrying, then, to keep down the unreasonable pain which thrilled my heart, on\r\nthus being made to feel that while Graham could devote to others the most grave\r\nand earnest, the manliest interest, he had no more than light raillery for\r\nLucy, the friend of lang syne, I inquired calmly,\u2014\u201cOn what points are we so\r\nclosely in accordance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe each have an observant faculty. You, perhaps, don\u2019t give me credit for the\r\npossession; yet I have it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you were speaking of tastes: we may see the same objects, yet estimate\r\nthem differently?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet us bring it to the test. Of course, you cannot but render homage to the\r\nmerits of Miss Fanshawe: now, what do you think of others in the room?\u2014my\r\nmother, for instance; or the lions yonder, Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and Z\u2014\u2014; or, let us\r\nsay, that pale little lady, Miss de Bassompierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know what I think of your mother. I have not thought of Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and\r\nZ\u2014\u2014.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the other?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think she is, as you say, a pale little lady\u2014pale, certainly, just now, when\r\nshe is fatigued with over-excitement.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember her as a child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder, sometimes, whether you do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had forgotten her; but it is noticeable, that circumstances, persons, even\r\nwords and looks, that had slipped your memory, may, under certain conditions,\r\ncertain aspects of your own or another\u2019s mind, revive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible enough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe revival is imperfect\u2014needs confirmation, partakes so\r\nmuch of the dim character of a dream, or of the airy one of a fancy, that the\r\ntestimony of a witness becomes necessary for corroboration. Were you not a\r\nguest at Bretton ten years ago, when Mr. Home brought his little girl, whom we\r\nthen called \u2018little Polly,\u2019 to stay with mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was there the night she came, and also the morning she went away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather a peculiar child, was she not? I wonder how I treated her. Was I fond\r\nof children in those days? Was there anything gracious or kindly about\r\nme\u2014great, reckless, schoolboy as I was? But you don\u2019t recollect me, of course?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have seen your own picture at La Terrasse. It is like you personally. In\r\nmanner, you were almost the same yesterday as to-day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Lucy, how is that? Such an oracle really whets my curiosity. What am I\r\nto-day? What was I the yesterday of ten years back?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGracious to whatever pleased you\u2014unkindly or cruel to nothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere you are wrong; I think I was almost a brute to you, for\r\ninstance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA brute! No, Graham: I should never have patiently endured brutality.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis, however, I do remember: quiet Lucy Snowe tasted nothing of\r\nmy grace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs little of your cruelty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, had I been Nero himself, I could not have tormented a being inoffensive\r\nas a shadow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled; but I also hushed a groan. Oh!\u2014I just wished he would let me\r\nalone\u2014cease allusion to me. These epithets\u2014these attributes I put from me. His\r\n\u201cquiet Lucy Snowe,\u201d his \u201cinoffensive shadow,\u201d I gave him back; not with scorn,\r\nbut with extreme weariness: theirs was the coldness and the pressure of lead;\r\nlet him whelm me with no such weight. Happily, he was soon on another theme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn what terms were \u2018little Polly\u2019 and I? Unless my recollections deceive me,\r\nwe were not foes\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou speak very vaguely. Do you think little Polly\u2019s memory, not more\r\ndefinite?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! we don\u2019t talk of \u2018little Polly\u2019 now. Pray say, Miss de\r\nBassompierre; and, of course, such a stately personage remembers nothing of\r\nBretton. Look at her large eyes, Lucy; can they read a word in the page of\r\nmemory? Are they the same which I used to direct to a horn-book? She does not\r\nknow that I partly taught her to read.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the Bible on Sunday nights?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has a calm, delicate, rather fine profile now: once what a little\r\nrestless, anxious countenance was hers! What a thing is a child\u2019s\r\npreference\u2014what a bubble! Would you believe it? that lady was fond of me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think she was in some measure fond of you,\u201d said I, moderately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember then? I had forgotten; but I remember now.\r\nShe liked me the best of whatever there was at Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI quite well recall it. I wish I could tell her all I recall; or rather, I\r\nwish some one, you for instance, would go behind and whisper it all in her ear,\r\nand I could have the delight\u2014here, as I sit\u2014of watching her look under the\r\nintelligence. Could you manage that, think you, Lucy, and make me ever\r\ngrateful?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould I manage to make you ever grateful?\u201d said I. \u201cNo, I could not.\u201d\r\nAnd I felt my fingers work and my hands interlock: I felt, too, an inward\r\ncourage, warm and resistant. In this matter I was not disposed to gratify Dr.\r\nJohn: not at all. With now welcome force, I realized his entire misapprehension\r\nof my character and nature. He wanted always to give me a role not mine. Nature\r\nand I opposed him. He did not at all guess what I felt: he did not read my\r\neyes, or face, or gestures; though, I doubt not, all spoke. Leaning towards me\r\ncoaxingly, he said, softly, \u201cDo content me, Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I would have contented, or, at least, I would clearly have enlightened him,\r\nand taught him well never again to expect of me the part of officious soubrette\r\nin a love drama; when, following his, soft, eager, murmur, meeting almost his\r\npleading, mellow\u2014\u201cDo content me, Lucy!\u201d a sharp hiss pierced my ear on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite chatte, doucerette, coquette!\u201d sibillated the sudden boa-constrictor;\r\n\u201cvous avez l\u2019air bien triste, soumis, r\u00eaveur, mais vous ne l\u2019\u00eates pas; c\u2019est\r\nmoi qui vous le dis: Sauvage! la flamme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2me, l\u2019\u00e9clair aux yeux!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOui; j\u2019ai la flamme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2me, et je dois l\u2019avoir!\u201d retorted I, turning in just\r\nwrath: but Professor Emanuel had hissed his insult and was gone.\r\n\n\r\nThe worst of the matter was, that Dr. Bretton, whose ears, as I have said, were\r\nquick and fine, caught every word of this apostrophe; he put his handkerchief\r\nto his face, and laughed till he shook.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell done, Lucy,\u201d cried he; \u201ccapital! petite chatte, petite coquette! Oh, I\r\nmust tell my mother! Is it true, Lucy, or half-true? I believe it is: you\r\nredden to the colour of Miss Fanshawe\u2019s gown. And really, by my word, now I\r\nexamine him, that is the same little man who was so savage with you at the\r\nconcert: the very same, and in his soul he is frantic at this moment because he\r\nsees me laughing. Oh! I must tease him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Graham, yielding to his bent for mischief, laughed, jested, and whispered\r\non till I could bear no more, and my eyes filled.\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly he was sobered: a vacant space appeared near Miss de Bassompierre; the\r\ncircle surrounding her seemed about to dissolve. This movement was instantly\r\ncaught by Graham\u2019s eye\u2014ever-vigilant, even while laughing; he rose, took his\r\ncourage in both hands, crossed the room, and made the advantage his own. Dr.\r\nJohn, throughout his whole life, was a man of luck\u2014a man of success. And why?\r\nBecause he had the eye to see his opportunity, the heart to prompt to\r\nwell-timed action, the nerve to consummate a perfect work. And no\r\ntyrant-passion dragged him back; no enthusiasms, no foibles encumbered his way.\r\nHow well he looked at this very moment! When Paulina looked up as he reached\r\nher side, her glance mingled at once with an encountering glance, animated, yet\r\nmodest; his colour, as he spoke to her, became half a blush, half a glow. He\r\nstood in her presence brave and bashful: subdued and unobtrusive, yet decided\r\nin his purpose and devoted in his ardour. I gathered all this by one view. I\r\ndid not prolong my observation\u2014time failed me, had inclination served: the\r\nnight wore late; Ginevra and I ought already to have been in the Rue Fossette.\r\nI rose, and bade good-night to my godmother and M. de Bassompierre.\r\n\n\r\nI know not whether Professor Emanuel had noticed my reluctant acceptance of Dr.\r\nBretton\u2019s badinage, or whether he perceived that I was pained, and that, on the\r\nwhole, the evening had not been one flow of exultant enjoyment for the\r\nvolatile, pleasure-loving Mademoiselle Lucie; but, as I was leaving the room,\r\nhe stepped up and inquired whether I had any one to attend me to the Rue\r\nFossette. The professor now spoke politely, and even deferentially, and\r\nhe looked apologetic and repentant; but I could not recognise his civility at a\r\nword, nor meet his contrition with crude, premature oblivion. Never hitherto\r\nhad I felt seriously disposed to resent his brusqueries, or freeze before his\r\nfierceness; what he had said to-night, however, I considered unwarranted: my\r\nextreme disapprobation of the proceeding must be marked, however slightly. I\r\nmerely said:\u2014\u201cI am provided with attendance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich was true, as Ginevra and I were to be sent home in the carriage; and I\r\npassed him with the sliding obeisance with which he was wont to be saluted in\r\nclasse by pupils crossing his estrade.\r\n\n\r\nHaving sought my shawl, I returned to the vestibule. M. Emanuel stood there as\r\nif waiting. He observed that the night was fine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d I said, with a tone and manner whose consummate chariness and\r\nfrostiness I could not but applaud. It was so seldom I could properly act out\r\nmy own resolution to be reserved and cool where I had been grieved or hurt,\r\nthat I felt almost proud of this one successful effort. That \u201cIs it?\u201d sounded\r\njust like the manner of other people. I had heard hundreds of such little\r\nminced, docked, dry phrases, from the pursed-up coral lips of a score of\r\nself-possessed, self-sufficing misses and mesdemoiselles. That M. Paul would\r\nnot stand any prolonged experience of this sort of dialogue I knew; but he\r\ncertainly merited a sample of the curt and arid. I believe he thought so\r\nhimself, for he took the dose quietly. He looked at my shawl and objected to\r\nits lightness. I decidedly told him it was as heavy as I wished. Receding\r\naloof, and standing apart, I leaned on the banister of the stairs, folded my\r\nshawl about me, and fixed my eyes on a dreary religious painting darkening the\r\nwall.\r\n\n\r\nGinevra was long in coming: tedious seemed her loitering. M. Paul was still\r\nthere; my ear expected from his lips an angry tone. He came nearer. \u201cNow for\r\nanother hiss!\u201d thought I: had not the action been too uncivil I could have\r\nstopped my ears with my fingers in terror of the thrill. Nothing happens as we\r\nexpect: listen for a coo or a murmur; it is then you will hear a cry of prey or\r\npain. Await a piercing shriek, an angry threat, and welcome an amicable\r\ngreeting, a low kind whisper. M. Paul spoke gently:\u2014\u201cFriends,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not\r\nquarrel for a word. Tell me, was it I or ce grand fat d\u2019Anglais\u201d (so he\r\nprofanely denominated Dr. Bretton), \u201cwho made your eyes so humid, and your\r\ncheeks so hot as they are even now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not conscious of you, monsieur, or of any other having excited such\r\nemotion as you indicate,\u201d was my answer; and in giving it, I again surpassed my\r\nusual self, and achieved a neat, frosty falsehood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what did I say?\u201d he pursued; \u201ctell me: I was angry: I have forgotten my\r\nwords; what were they?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuch as it is best to forget!\u201d said I, still quite calm and chill.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen it was my words which wounded you? Consider them unsaid: permit my\r\nretractation; accord my pardon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not angry, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are worse than angry\u2014grieved. Forgive me, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. Emanuel, I do forgive you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me hear you say, in the voice natural to you, and not in that alien tone,\r\n\u2018Mon ami, je vous pardonne.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe made me smile. Who could help smiling at his wistfulness, his simplicity,\r\nhis earnestness?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon!\u201d he cried. \u201cVoil\u00e0 que le jour va poindre! Dites donc, mon ami.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Paul, je vous pardonne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will have no monsieur: speak the other word, or I shall not believe you\r\nsincere: another effort\u2014mon ami, or else in English,\u2014my friend!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, \u201cmy friend\u201d had rather another sound and significancy than \u201cmon\r\nami;\u201d it did not breathe the same sense of domestic and intimate affection;\r\n\u201cmon ami\u201d I could not say to M. Paul; \u201cmy friend,\u201d I could, and\r\ndid say without difficulty. This distinction existed not for him, however, and\r\nhe was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He smiled. You should have seen\r\nhim smile, reader; and you should have marked the difference between his\r\ncountenance now, and that he wore half an hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had\r\never witnessed the smile of pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul\u2019s\r\nlips, or in his eyes before. The ironic, the sarcastic, the disdainful, the\r\npassionately exultant, I had hundreds of times seen him express by what he\r\ncalled a smile, but any illuminated sign of milder or warmer feelings struck me\r\nas wholly new in his visage. It changed it as from a mask to a face: the deep\r\nlines left his features; the very complexion seemed clearer and fresher; that\r\nswart, sallow, southern darkness which spoke his Spanish blood, became\r\ndisplaced by a lighter hue. I know not that I have ever seen in any other human\r\nface an equal metamorphosis from a similar cause. He now took me to the\r\ncarriage: at the same moment M. de Bassompierre came out with his niece.\r\n\n\r\nIn a pretty humour was Mistress Fanshawe; she had found the evening a grand\r\nfailure: completely upset as to temper, she gave way to the most uncontrolled\r\nmoroseness as soon as we were seated, and the carriage-door closed. Her\r\ninvectives against Dr. Bretton had something venomous in them. Having found\r\nherself impotent either to charm or sting him, hatred was her only resource;\r\nand this hatred she expressed in terms so unmeasured and proportion so\r\nmonstrous, that, after listening for a while with assumed stoicism, my outraged\r\nsense of justice at last and suddenly caught fire. An explosion ensued: for I\r\ncould be passionate, too; especially with my present fair but faulty associate,\r\nwho never failed to stir the worst dregs of me. It was well that the\r\ncarriage-wheels made a tremendous rattle over the flinty Choseville pavement,\r\nfor I can assure the reader there was neither dead silence nor calm discussion\r\nwithin the vehicle. Half in earnest, half in seeming, I made it my business to\r\nstorm down Ginevra. She had set out rampant from the Rue Cr\u00e9cy; it was\r\nnecessary to tame her before we reached the Rue Fossette: to this end it was\r\nindispensable to show up her sterling value and high deserts; and this must be\r\ndone in language of which the fidelity and homeliness might challenge\r\ncomparison with the compliments of a John Knox to a Mary Stuart. This was the\r\nright discipline for Ginevra; it suited her. I am quite sure she went to bed\r\nthat night all the better and more settled in mind and mood, and slept all the\r\nmore sweetly for having undergone a sound moral drubbing.\r\n\n"}
{"29": "\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE WATCHGUARD.\n\r\nM. Paul Emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of interruption,\r\nfrom whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: to pass through the classe\r\nunder such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the\r\nschool, individually and collectively, to be as much as a woman\u2019s or girl\u2019s\r\nlife was worth.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise, would \u201cskurry\u201d through,\r\nretrenching her skirts, and carefully coasting the formidable estrade, like a\r\nship dreading breakers. As to Rosine, the portress\u2014on whom, every half-hour,\r\ndevolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the very heart of one or\r\nother of the divisions to take their music-lessons in the oratory, the great or\r\nlittle saloon, the salle-\u00e0-manger, or some other piano-station\u2014she would, upon\r\nher second or third attempt, frequently become almost tongue-tied from excess\r\nof consternation\u2014a sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled at her\r\nthrough a pair of dart-dealing spectacles.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning I was sitting in the carr\u00e9, at work upon a piece of embroidery\r\nwhich one of the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish, and while my\r\nfingers wrought at the frame, my ears regaled themselves with listening to the\r\ncrescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in the neighbouring classe, in\r\ntones that waxed momentarily more unquiet, more ominously varied. There was a\r\ngood strong partition-wall between me and the gathering storm, as well as a\r\nfacile means of flight through the glass-door to the court, in case it swept\r\nthis way; so I am afraid I derived more amusement than alarm from these\r\nthickening symptoms. Poor Rosine was not safe: four times that blessed morning\r\nhad she made the passage of peril; and now, for the fifth time, it became her\r\ndangerous duty to snatch, as it were, a brand from the burning\u2014a pupil from\r\nunder M. Paul\u2019s nose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\u201d cried she. \u201cQue vais-je devenir? Monsieur va me tuer, je\r\nsuis s\u00fbre; car il est d\u2019une col\u00e8re!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNerved by the courage of desperation, she opened the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle La Malle au piano!\u201d was her cry.\r\n\n\r\nEre she could make good her retreat, or quite close the door, this voice\r\nuttered itself:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00e8s ce moment!\u2014la classe est d\u00e9fendue. La premi\u00e8re qui ouvrira cette porte, ou\r\npassera par cette division, sera pendue\u2014fut-ce Madame Beck elle-m\u00eame!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTen minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of this decree when Rosine\u2019s\r\nFrench pantoufles were again heard shuffling along the corridor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said she, \u201cI would not for a five-franc piece go into that\r\nclasse again just now: Monsieur\u2019s lunettes are really terrible; and here is a\r\ncommissionaire come with a message from the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e. I have told Madame Beck I\r\ndare not deliver it, and she says I am to charge you with it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMe? No, that is rather too bad! It is not in my line of duty. Come, come,\r\nRosine! bear your own burden. Be brave\u2014charge once more!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI, Mademoiselle?\u2014impossible! Five times I have crossed him this day. Madame\r\nmust really hire a gendarme for this service. Ouf! Je n\u2019en puis plus!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! you are only a coward. What is the message?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely of the kind with which Monsieur least likes to be pestered: an\r\nurgent summons to go directly to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, as there is an official\r\nvisitor\u2014inspector\u2014I know not what\u2014arrived, and Monsieur must meet him:\r\nyou know how he hates a must.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYes, I knew well enough. The restive little man detested spur or curb: against\r\nwhatever was urgent or obligatory, he was sure to revolt. However, I accepted\r\nthe responsibility\u2014not, certainly, without fear, but fear blent with other\r\nsentiments, curiosity, amongst them. I opened the door, I entered, I closed it\r\nbehind me as quickly and quietly as a rather unsteady hand would permit; for to\r\nbe slow or bustling, to rattle a latch, or leave a door gaping wide, were\r\naggravations of crime often more disastrous in result than the main crime\r\nitself. There I stood then, and there he sat; his humour was visibly bad\u2014almost\r\nat its worst; he had been giving a lesson in arithmetic\u2014for he gave lessons on\r\nany and every subject that struck his fancy\u2014and arithmetic being a dry subject,\r\ninvariably disagreed with him: not a pupil but trembled when he spoke of\r\nfigures. He sat, bent above his desk: to look up at the sound of an entrance,\r\nat the occurrence of a direct breach of his will and law, was an effort he\r\ncould not for the moment bring himself to make. It was quite as well: I thus\r\ngained time to walk up the long classe; and it suited my idiosyncracy far\r\nbetter to encounter the near burst of anger like his, than to bear its menace\r\nat a distance.\r\n\n\r\nAt his estrade I paused, just in front; of course I was not worthy of immediate\r\nattention: he proceeded with his lesson. Disdain would not do: he must hear and\r\nhe must answer my message.\r\n\n\r\nNot being quite tall enough to lift my head over his desk, elevated upon the\r\nestrade, and thus suffering eclipse in my present position, I ventured to peep\r\nround, with the design, at first, of merely getting a better view of his face,\r\nwhich had struck me when I entered as bearing a close and picturesque\r\nresemblance to that of a black and sallow tiger. Twice did I enjoy this\r\nside-view with impunity, advancing and receding unseen; the third time my eye\r\nhad scarce dawned beyond the obscuration of the desk, when it was caught and\r\ntransfixed through its very pupil\u2014transfixed by the \u201clunettes.\u201d Rosine was\r\nright; these utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror, beyond the\r\nmobile wrath of the wearer\u2019s own unglazed eyes.\r\n\n\r\nI now found the advantage of proximity: these short-sighted \u201clunettes\u201d were\r\nuseless for the inspection of a criminal under Monsieur\u2019s nose; accordingly, he\r\ndoffed them, and he and I stood on more equal terms.\r\n\n\r\nI am glad I was not really much afraid of him\u2014that, indeed, close in his\r\npresence, I felt no terror at all; for upon his demanding cord and gibbet to\r\nexecute the sentence recently pronounced, I was able to furnish him with a\r\nneedleful of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility as could not\r\nbut allay some portion at least of his surplus irritation. Of course I did not\r\nparade this courtesy before public view: I merely handed the thread round the\r\nangle of the desk, and attached it, ready noosed, to the barred back of the\r\nProfessor\u2019s chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue me voulez-vous?\u201d said he in a growl of which the music was wholly confined\r\nto his chest and throat, for he kept his teeth clenched; and seemed registering\r\nto himself an inward vow that nothing earthly should wring from him a smile.\r\n\n\r\nMy answer commenced uncompromisingly: \u201cMonsieur,\u201d I said, \u201cje veux\r\nl\u2019impossible, des choses inou\u00efes;\u201d and thinking it best not to mince matters,\r\nbut to administer the \u201cdouche\u201d with decision, in a low but quick voice, I\r\ndelivered the Athenian message, floridly exaggerating its urgency.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, he would not hear a word of it. \u201cHe would not go; he would not leave\r\nhis present class, let all the officials of Villette send for him. He would not\r\nput himself an inch out of his way at the bidding of king, cabinet, and\r\nchambers together.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knew, however, that he must go; that, talk as he would, both his duty\r\nand interest commanded an immediate and literal compliance with the summons: I\r\nstood, therefore, waiting in silence, as if he had not yet spoken. He asked\r\nwhat more I wanted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly Monsieur\u2019s answer to deliver to the commissionaire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe waved an impatient negative.\r\n\n\r\nI ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnet-grec which lay in grim repose on\r\nthe window-sill. He followed this daring movement with his eye, no doubt in\r\nmixed pity and amazement at its presumption.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d he muttered, \u201cif it came to that\u2014if Miss Lucy meddled with his\r\nbonnet-grec\u2014she might just put it on herself, turn gar\u00e7on for the occasion, and\r\nbenevolently go to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in his stead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith great respect, I laid the bonnet on the desk, where its tassel seemed to\r\ngive me an awful nod.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll write a note of apology\u2014that will do!\u201d said he, still bent on evasion.\r\n\n\r\nKnowing well it would not do, I gently pushed the bonnet towards his\r\nhand. Thus impelled, it slid down the polished slope of the varnished and\r\nunbaized desk, carried before it the light steel-framed \u201clunettes,\u201d and,\r\nfearful to relate, they fell to the estrade. A score of times ere now had I\r\nseen them fall and receive no damage\u2014this time, as Lucy Snowe\u2019s hapless\r\nluck would have it, they so fell that each clear pebble became a shivered and\r\nshapeless star.\r\n\n\r\nNow, indeed, dismay seized me\u2014dismay and regret. I knew the value of these\r\n\u201clunettes\u201d: M. Paul\u2019s sight was peculiar, not easily fitted, and these glasses\r\nsuited him. I had heard him call them his treasures: as I picked them up,\r\ncracked and worthless, my hand trembled. Frightened through all my nerves I was\r\nto see the mischief I had done, but I think I was even more sorry than afraid.\r\nFor some seconds I dared not look the bereaved Professor in the face; he was\r\nthe first to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cL\u00e0!\u201d said he: \u201cme voil\u00e0 veuf de mes lunettes! I think Mademoiselle Lucy will\r\nnow confess that the cord and gallows are amply earned; she trembles in\r\nanticipation of her doom. Ah, traitress! traitress! You are resolved to have me\r\nquite blind and helpless in your hands!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI lifted my eyes: his face, instead of being irate, lowering, and furrowed, was\r\noverflowing with the smile, coloured with the bloom I had seen brightening it\r\nthat evening at the Hotel Cr\u00e9cy. He was not angry\u2014not even grieved. For the\r\nreal injury he showed himself full of clemency; under the real provocation,\r\npatient as a saint. This event, which seemed so untoward\u2014which I thought had\r\nruined at once my chance of successful persuasion\u2014proved my best help.\r\nDifficult of management so long as I had done him no harm, he became graciously\r\npliant as soon as I stood in his presence a conscious and contrite offender.\r\n\n\r\nStill gently railing at me as \u201cune forte femme\u2014une Anglaise terrible\u2014une petite\r\ncasse-tout\u201d\u2014he declared that he dared not but obey one who had given such an\r\ninstance of her dangerous prowess; it was absolutely like the \u201cgrand Empereur\r\nsmashing the vase to inspire dismay.\u201d So, at last, crowning himself with his\r\nbonnet-grec, and taking his ruined \u201clunettes\u201d from my hand with a clasp of kind\r\npardon and encouragement, he made his bow, and went off to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in\r\nfirst-rate humour and spirits.\r\n\n\r\nAfter all this amiability, the reader will be sorry for my sake to hear that I\r\nwas quarrelling with M. Paul again before night; yet so it was, and I could not\r\nhelp it.\r\n\n\r\nIt was his occasional custom\u2014and a very laudable, acceptable custom, too\u2014to\r\narrive of an evening, always \u00e0 l\u2019improviste, unannounced, burst in on the\r\nsilent hour of study, establish a sudden despotism over us and our occupations,\r\ncause books to be put away, work-bags to be brought out, and, drawing forth a\r\nsingle thick volume, or a handful of pamphlets, substitute for the besotted\r\n\u201clecture pieuse,\u201d drawled by a sleepy pupil, some tragedy made grand by grand\r\nreading, ardent by fiery action\u2014some drama, whereof, for my part, I rarely\r\nstudied the intrinsic merit; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring,\r\nand filled it with his native verve and passion like a cup with a vital\r\nbrewage. Or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a\r\nbrighter world, show us a glimpse of the current literature of the day, read us\r\npassages from some enchanting tale, or the last witty feuilleton which had\r\nawakened laughter in the saloons of Paris; taking care always to expunge, with\r\nthe severest hand, whether from tragedy, melodrama, tale, or essay, whatever\r\npassage, phrase, or word, could be deemed unsuited to an audience of \u201cjeunes\r\nfilles.\u201d I noticed more than once, that where retrenchment without substitute\r\nwould have left unmeaning vacancy, or introduced weakness, he could, and did,\r\nimprovise whole paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the\r\ndialogue\u2014the description\u2014he engrafted was often far better than that he pruned\r\naway.\r\n\n\r\nWell, on the evening in question, we were sitting silent as nuns in a\r\n\u201cretreat,\u201d the pupils studying, the teachers working. I remember my work; it\r\nwas a slight matter of fancy, and it rather interested me; it had a purpose; I\r\nwas not doing it merely to kill time; I meant it when finished as a gift; and\r\nthe occasion of presentation being near, haste was requisite, and my fingers\r\nwere busy.\r\n\n\r\nWe heard the sharp bell-peal which we all knew; then the rapid step familiar to\r\neach ear: the words \u201cVoil\u00e0 Monsieur!\u201d had scarcely broken simultaneously from\r\nevery lip, when the two-leaved door split (as split it always did for his\r\nadmission\u2014such a slow word as \u201copen\u201d is inefficient to describe his movements),\r\nand he stood in the midst of us.\r\n\n\r\nThere were two study tables, both long and flanked with benches; over the\r\ncentre of each hung a lamp; beneath this lamp, on either side the table, sat a\r\nteacher; the girls were arranged to the right hand and the left; the eldest and\r\nmost studious nearest the lamps or tropics; the idlers and little ones towards\r\nthe north and south poles. Monsieur\u2019s habit was politely to hand a chair to\r\nsome teacher, generally Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, the senior mistress; then to take her\r\nvacated seat; and thus avail himself of the full beam of Cancer or Capricorn,\r\nwhich, owing to his near sight, he needed.\r\n\n\r\nAs usual, Z\u00e9lie rose with alacrity, smiling to the whole extent of her mouth,\r\nand the full display of her upper and under rows of teeth\u2014that strange smile\r\nwhich passes from ear to ear, and is marked only by a sharp thin curve, which\r\nfails to spread over the countenance, and neither dimples the cheek nor lights\r\nthe eye. I suppose Monsieur did not see her, or he had taken a whim that he\r\nwould not notice her, for he was as capricious as women are said to be; then\r\nhis \u201clunettes\u201d (he had got another pair) served him as an excuse for all sorts\r\nof little oversights and shortcomings. Whatever might be his reason, he passed\r\nby Z\u00e9lie, came to the other side of the table, and before I could start up to\r\nclear the way, whispered, \u201cNe bougez pas,\u201d and established himself between me\r\nand Miss Fanshawe, who always would be my neighbour, and have her elbow in my\r\nside, however often I declared to her, \u201cGinevra, I wish you were at Jericho.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was easy to say, \u201cNe bougez pas;\u201d but how could I help it? I must make him\r\nroom, and I must request the pupils to recede that I might recede. It\r\nwas very well for Ginevra to be gummed to me, \u201ckeeping herself warm,\u201d as she\r\nsaid, on the winter evenings, and harassing my very heart with her fidgetings\r\nand pokings, obliging me, indeed, sometimes to put an artful pin in my girdle\r\nby way of protection against her elbow; but I suppose M. Emanuel was not to be\r\nsubjected to the same kind of treatment, so I swept away my working materials,\r\nto clear space for his book, and withdrew myself to make room for his person;\r\nnot, however, leaving more than a yard of interval, just what any reasonable\r\nman would have regarded as a convenient, respectful allowance of bench. But M.\r\nEmanuel never was reasonable; flint and tinder that he was! he struck\r\nand took fire directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous ne voulez pas de moi pour voisin,\u201d he growled: \u201cvous vous donnez des airs\r\nde caste; vous me traitez en paria;\u201d he scowled. \u201cSoit! je vais arranger la\r\nchose!\u201d And he set to work.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLevez vous toutes, Mesdemoiselles!\u201d cried he.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls rose. He made them all file off to the other table. He then placed me\r\nat one extremity of the long bench, and having duly and carefully brought me my\r\nwork-basket, silk, scissors, all my implements, he fixed himself quite at the\r\nother end.\r\n\n\r\nAt this arrangement, highly absurd as it was, not a soul in the room dared to\r\nlaugh; luckless for the giggler would have been the giggle. As for me, I took\r\nit with entire coolness. There I sat, isolated and cut off from human\r\nintercourse; I sat and minded my work, and was quiet, and not at all unhappy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst ce assez de distance?\u201d he demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur en est l\u2019arbitre,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous savez bien que non. C\u2019est vous qui avez cr\u00e9e ce vide immense: moi je n\u2019y\r\nai pas mis la main.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd with this assertion he commenced the reading.\r\n\n\r\nFor his misfortune he had chosen a French translation of what he called \u201cun\r\ndrame de Williams Shackspire; le faux dieu,\u201d he further announced, \u201cde ces sots\r\npa\u00efens, les Anglais.\u201d How far otherwise he would have characterized him had his\r\ntemper not been upset, I scarcely need intimate.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, the translation being French, was very inefficient; nor did I make\r\nany particular effort to conceal the contempt which some of its forlorn lapses\r\nwere calculated to excite. Not that it behoved or beseemed me to say anything:\r\nbut one can occasionally look the opinion it is forbidden to embody in\r\nwords. Monsieur\u2019s lunettes being on the alert, he gleaned up every stray look;\r\nI don\u2019t think he lost one: the consequence was, his eyes soon discarded a\r\nscreen, that their blaze might sparkle free, and he waxed hotter at the north\r\npole to which he had voluntarily exiled himself, than, considering the general\r\ntemperature of the room, it would have been reasonable to become under the\r\nvertical ray of Cancer itself.\r\n\n\r\nThe reading over, it appeared problematic whether he would depart with his\r\nanger unexpressed, or whether he would give it vent. Suppression was not much\r\nin his habits; but still, what had been done to him definite enough to afford\r\nmatter for overt reproof? I had not uttered a sound, and could not justly be\r\ndeemed amenable to reprimand or penalty for having permitted a slightly freer\r\naction than usual to the muscles about my eyes and mouth.\r\n\n\r\nThe supper, consisting of bread, and milk diluted with tepid water, was brought\r\nin. In respectful consideration of the Professor\u2019s presence, the rolls and\r\nglasses were allowed to stand instead of being immediately handed round.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake your supper, ladies,\u201d said he, seeming to be occupied in making marginal\r\nnotes to his \u201cWilliams Shackspire.\u201d They took it. I also accepted a roll and\r\nglass, but being now more than ever interested in my work, I kept my seat of\r\npunishment, and wrought while I munched my bread and sipped my beverage, the\r\nwhole with easy sang-froid; with a certain snugness of composure,\r\nindeed, scarcely in my habits, and pleasantly novel to my feelings. It seemed\r\nas if the presence of a nature so restless, chafing, thorny as that of M. Paul\r\nabsorbed all feverish and unsettling influences like a magnet, and left me none\r\nbut such as were placid and harmonious.\r\n\n\r\nHe rose. \u201cWill he go away without saying another word?\u201d Yes; he turned to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\n\r\nNo: he re-turned on his steps; but only, perhaps, to take his\r\npencil-case, which had been left on the table.\r\n\n\r\nHe took it\u2014shut the pencil in and out, broke its point against the wood, re-cut\r\nand pocketed it, and . . . walked promptly up to me.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls and teachers, gathered round the other table, were talking pretty\r\nfreely: they always talked at meals; and, from the constant habit of speaking\r\nfast and loud at such times, did not now subdue their voices much.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul came and stood behind me. He asked at what I was working; and I said I\r\nwas making a watchguard.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked, \u201cFor whom?\u201d And I answered, \u201cFor a gentleman\u2014one of my friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul stooped down and proceeded\u2014as novel-writers say, and, as was literally\r\ntrue in his case\u2014to \u201chiss\u201d into my ear some poignant words.\r\n\n\r\nHe said that, of all the women he knew, I was the one who could make herself\r\nthe most consummately unpleasant: I was she with whom it was least possible to\r\nlive on friendly terms. I had a \u201ccaract\u00e8re intraitable,\u201d and perverse to a\r\nmiracle. How I managed it, or what possessed me, he, for his part, did not\r\nknow; but with whatever pacific and amicable intentions a person accosted\r\nme\u2014crac! I turned concord to discord, good-will to enmity. He was sure, he\u2014M.\r\nPaul\u2014wished me well enough; he had never done me any harm that he knew of; he\r\nmight, at least, he supposed, claim a right to be regarded as a neutral\r\nacquaintance, guiltless of hostile sentiments: yet, how I behaved to him! With\r\nwhat pungent vivacities\u2014what an impetus of mutiny\u2014what a \u201cfougue\u201d of injustice!\r\n\n\r\nHere I could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat wide, and even slipping in a\r\nslight interjectional observation: \u201cVivacities? Impetus? Fougue? I didn\u2019t\r\nknow\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChut! \u00e0 l\u2019instant! There! there I went\u2014vive comme la poudre!\u201d He was sorry\u2014he\r\nwas very sorry: for my sake he grieved over the hapless peculiarity. This\r\n\u201cemportement,\u201d this \u201cchaleur\u201d\u2014generous, perhaps, but excessive\u2014would yet, he\r\nfeared, do me a mischief. It was a pity: I was not\u2014he believed, in his\r\nsoul\u2014wholly without good qualities: and would I but hear reason, and be more\r\nsedate, more sober, less \u201cen l\u2019air,\u201d less \u201ccoquette,\u201d less taken by show, less\r\nprone to set an undue value on outside excellence\u2014to make much of the\r\nattentions of people remarkable chiefly for so many feet of stature, \u201cdes\r\ncouleurs de poup\u00e9e,\u201d \u201cun nez plus ou moins bien fait,\u201d and an enormous amount\r\nof fatuity\u2014I might yet prove an useful, perhaps an exemplary character. But, as\r\nit was\u2014And here, the little man\u2019s voice was for a minute choked.\r\n\n\r\nI would have looked up at him, or held out my hand, or said a soothing word;\r\nbut I was afraid, if I stirred, I should either laugh or cry; so odd, in all\r\nthis, was the mixture of the touching and the absurd.\r\n\n\r\nI thought he had nearly done: but no; he sat down that he might go on at his\r\nease.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhile he, M. Paul, was on these painful topics, he would dare my anger for the\r\nsake of my good, and would venture to refer to a change he had noticed in my\r\ndress. He was free to confess that when he first knew me\u2014or, rather, was in the\r\nhabit of catching a passing glimpse of me from time to time\u2014I satisfied him on\r\nthis point: the gravity, the austere simplicity, obvious in this particular,\r\nwere such as to inspire the highest hopes for my best interests. What fatal\r\ninfluence had impelled me lately to introduce flowers under the brim of my\r\nbonnet, to wear \u2018des cols brod\u00e9s,\u2019 and even to appear on one occasion in a\r\nscarlet gown\u2014he might indeed conjecture, but, for the present, would not\r\nopenly declare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I interrupted, and this time not without an accent at once indignant and\r\nhorror-struck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScarlet, Monsieur Paul? It was not scarlet! It was pink, and pale pink too,\r\nand further subdued by black lace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPink or scarlet, yellow or crimson, pea-green or sky-blue, it was all one:\r\nthese were all flaunting, giddy colours; and as to the lace I talked of,\r\nthat was but a \u2018colifichet de plus.\u2019\u201d And he sighed over my degeneracy.\r\n\u201cHe could not, he was sorry to say, be so particular on this theme as he could\r\nwish: not possessing the exact names of these \u2018babioles,\u2019 he might run into\r\nsmall verbal errors which would not fail to lay him open to my sarcasm, and\r\nexcite my unhappily sudden and passionate disposition. He would merely say, in\r\ngeneral terms\u2014and in these general terms he knew he was correct\u2014that my costume\r\nhad of late assumed \u2018des fa\u00e7ons mondaines,\u2019 which it wounded him to see.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat \u201cfa\u00e7ons mondaines\u201d he discovered in my present winter merino and plain\r\nwhite collar, I own it puzzled me to guess: and when I asked him, he said it\r\nwas all made with too much attention to effect\u2014and besides, \u201chad I not a bow of\r\nribbon at my neck?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if you condemn a bow of ribbon for a lady, Monsieur, you would necessarily\r\ndisapprove of a thing like this for a gentleman?\u201d\u2014holding up my bright little\r\nchainlet of silk and gold. His sole reply was a groan\u2014I suppose over my levity.\r\n\n\r\nAfter sitting some minutes in silence, and watching the progress of the chain,\r\nat which I now wrought more assiduously than ever, he inquired: \u201cWhether what\r\nhe had just said would have the effect of making me entirely detest him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hardly remember what answer I made, or how it came about; I don\u2019t think I\r\nspoke at all, but I know we managed to bid good-night on friendly terms: and,\r\neven after M. Paul had reached the door, he turned back just to explain, \u201cthat\r\nhe would not be understood to speak in entire condemnation of the scarlet\r\ndress\u201d (\u201cPink! pink!\u201d I threw in); \u201cthat he had no intention to deny it the\r\nmerit of looking rather well\u201d (the fact was, M. Emanuel\u2019s taste in\r\ncolours decidedly leaned to the brilliant); \u201conly he wished to counsel me,\r\nwhenever I wore it, to do so in the same spirit as if its material were\r\n\u2018bure,\u2019 and its hue \u2018gris de poussi\u00e8re.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the flowers under my bonnet, Monsieur?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey are very little\r\nones\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep them little, then,\u201d said he. \u201cPermit them not to become full-blown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the bow, Monsieur\u2014the bit of ribbon?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVa pour le ruban!\u201d was the propitious answer.\r\n\n\r\nAnd so we settled it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell done, Lucy Snowe!\u201d cried I to myself; \u201cyou have come in for a pretty\r\nlecture\u2014brought on yourself a \u2018rude savant,\u2019 and all through your wicked\r\nfondness for worldly vanities! Who would have thought it? You deemed yourself a\r\nmelancholy sober-sides enough! Miss Fanshawe there regards you as a second\r\nDiogenes. M. de Bassompierre, the other day, politely turned the conversation\r\nwhen it ran on the wild gifts of the actress Vashti, because, as he kindly\r\nsaid, \u2018Miss Snowe looked uncomfortable.\u2019 Dr. John Bretton knows you only as\r\n\u2018quiet Lucy\u2019\u2014\u2018a creature inoffensive as a shadow;\u2019 he has said, and you have\r\nheard him say it: \u2018Lucy\u2019s disadvantages spring from over-gravity in tastes and\r\nmanner\u2014want of colour in character and costume.\u2019 Such are your own and your\r\nfriends\u2019 impressions; and behold! there starts up a little man, differing\r\ndiametrically from all these, roundly charging you with being too airy and\r\ncheery\u2014too volatile and versatile\u2014too flowery and coloury. This harsh little\r\nman\u2014this pitiless censor\u2014gathers up all your poor scattered sins of vanity,\r\nyour luckless chiffon of rose-colour, your small fringe of a wreath, your small\r\nscrap of ribbon, your silly bit of lace, and calls you to account for the lot,\r\nand for each item. You are well habituated to be passed by as a shadow in\r\nLife\u2019s sunshine: it is a new thing to see one testily lifting his hand to\r\nscreen his eyes, because you tease him with an obtrusive ray.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"30": "\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nMONSIEUR\u2019S F\u00caTE.\n\r\nI was up the next morning an hour before daybreak, and finished my guard,\r\nkneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand, for the benefit of\r\nsuch expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last watch.\r\n\n\r\nAll my materials\u2014my whole stock of beads and silk\u2014were used up before the chain\r\nassumed the length and richness I wished; I had wrought it double, as I knew,\r\nby the rule of contraries, that to, suit the particular taste whose\r\ngratification was in view, an effective appearance was quite indispensable. As\r\na finish to the ornament, a little gold clasp was needed; fortunately I\r\npossessed it in the fastening of my sole necklace; I duly detached and\r\nre-attached it, then coiled compactly the completed guard; and enclosed it in a\r\nsmall box I had bought for its brilliancy, made of some tropic shell of the\r\ncolour called \u201cnacarat,\u201d and decked with a little coronal of sparkling blue\r\nstones. Within the lid of the box, I carefully graved with my scissors\u2019 point\r\ncertain initials.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader will, perhaps, remember the description of Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate; nor\r\nwill he have forgotten that at each anniversary, a handsome present was\r\nsubscribed for and offered by the school. The observance of this day was a\r\ndistinction accorded to none but Madame, and, in a modified form, to her\r\nkinsman and counsellor, M. Emanuel. In the latter case it was an honour\r\nspontaneously awarded, not plotted and contrived beforehand, and offered an\r\nadditional proof, amongst many others, of the estimation in which\u2014despite his\r\npartialities, prejudices, and irritabilities\u2014the professor of literature was\r\nheld by his pupils. No article of value was offered to him: he distinctly gave\r\nit to be understood, that he would accept neither plate nor jewellery. Yet he\r\nliked a slight tribute; the cost, the money-value, did not touch him: a diamond\r\nring, a gold snuff-box, presented, with pomp, would have pleased him less than\r\na flower, or a drawing, offered simply and with sincere feelings. Such was his\r\nnature. He was a man, not wise in his generation, yet could he claim a filial\r\nsympathy with \u201cthe dayspring on high.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul\u2019s f\u00eate fell on the first of March and a Thursday. It proved a fine\r\nsunny day; and being likewise the morning on which it was customary to attend\r\nmass; being also otherwise distinguished by the half-holiday which permitted\r\nthe privilege of walking out, shopping, or paying visits in the afternoon:\r\nthese combined considerations induced a general smartness and freshness of\r\ndress. Clean collars were in vogue; the ordinary dingy woollen classe-dress was\r\nexchanged for something lighter and clearer. Mademoiselle Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, on\r\nthis particular Thursday, even assumed a \u201crobe de soie,\u201d deemed in economical\r\nLabassecour an article of hazardous splendour and luxury; nay, it was remarked\r\nthat she sent for a \u201ccoiffeur\u201d to dress her hair that morning; there were\r\npupils acute enough to discover that she had bedewed her handkerchief and her\r\nhands with a new and fashionable perfume. Poor Z\u00e9lie! It was much her wont to\r\ndeclare about this time, that she was tired to death of a life of seclusion and\r\nlabour; that she longed to have the means and leisure for relaxation; to have\r\nsome one to work for her\u2014a husband who would pay her debts (she was woefully\r\nencumbered with debt), supply her wardrobe, and leave her at liberty, as she\r\nsaid, to \u201cgo\u00fbter un peu les plaisirs.\u201d It had long been rumoured, that her eye\r\nwas upon M. Emanuel. Monsieur Emanuel\u2019s eye was certainly often upon her. He\r\nwould sit and watch her perseveringly for minutes together. I have seen him\r\ngive her a quarter-of-an-hour\u2019s gaze, while the class was silently composing,\r\nand he sat throned on his estrade, unoccupied. Conscious always of this\r\nbasilisk attention, she would writhe under it, half-flattered, half-puzzled,\r\nand Monsieur would follow her sensations, sometimes looking appallingly acute;\r\nfor in some cases, he had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct, and\r\npierced in its hiding-place the last lurking thought of the heart, and\r\ndiscerned under florid veilings the bare; barren places of the spirit: yes, and\r\nits perverted tendencies, and its hidden false curves\u2014all that men and women\r\nwould not have known\u2014the twisted spine, the malformed limb that was born with\r\nthem, and far worse, the stain or disfigurement they have perhaps brought on\r\nthemselves. No calamity so accursed but M. Emanuel could pity and forgive, if\r\nit were acknowledged candidly; but where his questioning eyes met dishonest\r\ndenial\u2014where his ruthless researches found deceitful concealment\u2014oh, then, he\r\ncould be cruel, and I thought wicked! he would exultantly snatch the screen\r\nfrom poor shrinking wretches, passionately hurry them to the summit of the\r\nmount of exposure, and there show them all naked, all false\u2014poor living\r\nlies\u2014the spawn of that horrid Truth which cannot be looked on unveiled. He\r\nthought he did justice; for my part I doubt whether man has a right to do such\r\njustice on man: more than once in these his visitations, I have felt compelled\r\nto give tears to his victims, and not spared ire and keen reproach to himself.\r\nHe deserved it; but it was difficult to shake him in his firm conviction that\r\nthe work was righteous and needed.\r\n\n\r\nBreakfast being over and mass attended, the school-bell rang and the rooms\r\nfilled: a very pretty spectacle was presented in classe. Pupils and teachers\r\nsat neatly arrayed, orderly and expectant, each bearing in her hand the bouquet\r\nof felicitation\u2014the prettiest spring-flowers all fresh, and filling the air\r\nwith their fragrance: I only had no bouquet. I like to see flowers growing, but\r\nwhen they are gathered, they cease to please. I look on them as things rootless\r\nand perishable; their likeness to life makes me sad. I never offer flowers to\r\nthose I love; I never wish to receive them from hands dear to me. Mademoiselle\r\nSt. Pierre marked my empty hands\u2014she could not believe I had been so remiss;\r\nwith avidity her eye roved over and round me: surely I must have some solitary\r\nsymbolic flower somewhere: some small knot of violets, something to win myself\r\npraise for taste, commendation for ingenuity. The unimaginative \u201cAnglaise\u201d\r\nproved better than the Parisienne\u2019s fears: she sat literally unprovided, as\r\nbare of bloom or leaf as the winter tree. This ascertained, Z\u00e9lie smiled, well\r\npleased.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow wisely you have acted to keep your money, Miss Lucie,\u201d she said: \u201csilly I\r\nhave gone and thrown away two francs on a bouquet of hot-house flowers!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she showed with pride her splendid nosegay.\r\n\n\r\nBut hush! a step: the step. It came prompt, as usual, but with a\r\npromptitude, we felt disposed to flatter ourselves, inspired by other feelings\r\nthan mere excitability of nerve and vehemence of intent. We thought our\r\nProfessor\u2019s \u201cfoot-fall\u201d (to speak romantically) had in it a friendly promise\r\nthis morning; and so it had.\r\n\n\r\nHe entered in a mood which made him as good as a new sunbeam to the already\r\nwell-lit first classe. The morning light playing amongst our plants and\r\nlaughing on our walls, caught an added lustre from M. Paul\u2019s all-benignant\r\nsalute. Like a true Frenchman (though I don\u2019t know why I should say so, for he\r\nwas of strain neither French nor Labassecourien), he had dressed for the\r\n\u201csituation\u201d and the occasion. Not by the vague folds, sinister and\r\nconspirator-like, of his soot-dark palet\u00f4t were the outlines of his person\r\nobscured; on the contrary, his figure (such as it was, I don\u2019t boast of it) was\r\nwell set off by a civilized coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold. The\r\ndefiant and pagan bonnet-grec had vanished: bare-headed, he came upon us,\r\ncarrying a Christian hat in his gloved hand. The little man looked well, very\r\nwell; there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye, and a glow of good\r\nfeeling on his dark complexion, which passed perfectly in the place of beauty:\r\none really did not care to observe that his nose, though far from small, was of\r\nno particular shape, his cheek thin, his brow marked and square, his mouth no\r\nrose-bud: one accepted him as he was, and felt his presence the reverse of\r\ndamping or insignificant.\r\n\n\r\nHe passed to his desk; he placed on the same his hat and gloves. \u201cBon jour, mes\r\namies,\u201d said he, in a tone that somehow made amends to some amongst us for many\r\na sharp snap and savage snarl: not a jocund, good-fellow tone, still less an\r\nunctuous priestly, accent, but a voice he had belonging to himself\u2014a voice used\r\nwhen his heart passed the words to his lips. That same heart did speak\r\nsometimes; though an irritable, it was not an ossified organ: in its core was a\r\nplace, tender beyond a man\u2019s tenderness; a place that humbled him to little\r\nchildren, that bound him to girls and women to whom, rebel as he would, he\r\ncould not disown his affinity, nor quite deny that, on the whole, he was better\r\nwith them than with his own sex.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe all wish Monsieur a good day, and present to him our congratulations on the\r\nanniversary of his f\u00eate,\u201d said Mademoiselle Z\u00e9lie, constituting herself\r\nspokeswoman of the assembly; and advancing with no more twists of affectation\r\nthan were with her indispensable to the achievement of motion, she laid her\r\ncostly bouquet before him. He bowed over it.\r\n\n\r\nThe long train of offerings followed: all the pupils, sweeping past with the\r\ngliding step foreigners practise, left their tributes as they went by. Each\r\ngirl so dexterously adjusted her separate gift, that when the last bouquet was\r\nlaid on the desk, it formed the apex to a blooming pyramid\u2014a pyramid blooming,\r\nspreading, and towering with such exuberance as, in the end, to eclipse the\r\nhero behind it. This ceremony over, seats were resumed, and we sat in dead\r\nsilence, expectant of a speech.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose five minutes might have elapsed, and the hush remained unbroken;\r\nten\u2014and there was no sound.\r\n\n\r\nMany present began, doubtless, to wonder for what Monsieur waited; as well they\r\nmight. Voiceless and viewless, stirless and wordless, he kept his station\r\nbehind the pile of flowers.\r\n\n\r\nAt last there issued forth a voice, rather deep, as if it spoke out of a\r\nhollow:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMademoiselle Z\u00e9lie looked round.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have all presented your bouquets?\u201d inquired she of the pupils.\r\n\n\r\nYes; they had all given their nosegays, from the eldest to the youngest, from\r\nthe tallest to the most diminutive. The senior mistress signified as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d was reiterated in an intonation which, deep before, had now\r\ndescended some notes lower.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Mademoiselle St. Pierre, rising, and this time speaking with\r\nher own sweet smile, \u201cI have the honour to tell you that, with a single\r\nexception, every person in classe has offered her bouquet. For Meess Lucie,\r\nMonsieur will kindly make allowance; as a foreigner she probably did not know\r\nour customs, or did not appreciate their significance. Meess Lucie has regarded\r\nthis ceremony as too frivolous to be honoured by her observance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFamous!\u201d I muttered between my teeth: \u201cyou are no bad speaker, Z\u00e9lie, when you\r\nbegin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe answer vouchsafed to Mademoiselle St Pierre from the estrade was given in\r\nthe gesticulation of a hand from behind the pyramid. This manual action seemed\r\nto deprecate words, to enjoin silence.\r\n\n\r\nA form, ere long, followed the hand. Monsieur emerged from his eclipse; and\r\nproducing himself on the front of his estrade, and gazing straight and fixedly\r\nbefore him at a vast \u201cmappe-monde\u201d covering the wall opposite, he demanded a\r\nthird time, and now in really tragic tones\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI might yet have made all right, by stepping forwards and slipping into his\r\nhand the ruddy little shell-box I at that moment held tight in my own. It was\r\nwhat I had fully purposed to do; but, first, the comic side of Monsieur\u2019s\r\nbehaviour had tempted me to delay, and now, Mademoiselle St. Pierre\u2019s affected\r\ninterference provoked contumacity. The reader not having hitherto had any cause\r\nto ascribe to Miss Snowe\u2019s character the most distant pretensions to\r\nperfection, will be scarcely surprised to learn that she felt too perverse to\r\ndefend herself from any imputation the Parisienne might choose to insinuate and\r\nbesides, M. Paul was so tragic, and took my defection so seriously, he deserved\r\nto be vexed. I kept, then, both my box and my countenance, and sat insensate as\r\nany stone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well!\u201d dropped at length from the lips of M. Paul; and having uttered\r\nthis phrase, the shadow of some great paroxysm\u2014the swell of wrath, scorn,\r\nresolve\u2014passed over his brow, rippled his lips, and lined his cheeks. Gulping\r\ndown all further comment, he launched into his customary \u201cdiscours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI can\u2019t at all remember what this \u201cdiscours\u201d was; I did not listen to it: the\r\ngulping-down process, the abrupt dismissal of his mortification or vexation,\r\nhad given me a sensation which half-counteracted the ludicrous effect of the\r\nreiterated \u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTowards the close of the speech there came a pleasing diversion my attention\r\nwas again amusingly arrested.\r\n\n\r\nOwing to some little accidental movement\u2014I think I dropped my thimble on the\r\nfloor, and in stooping to regain it, hit the crown of my head against the sharp\r\ncorner of my desk; which casualties (exasperating to me, by rights, if to\r\nanybody) naturally made a slight bustle\u2014M. Paul became irritated, and\r\ndismissing his forced equanimity, and casting to the winds that dignity and\r\nself-control with which he never cared long to encumber himself, he broke forth\r\ninto the strain best calculated to give him ease.\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how, in the progress of his \u201cdiscours\u201d, he had contrived to cross\r\nthe Channel and land on British ground; but there I found him when I began to\r\nlisten.\r\n\n\r\nCasting a quick, cynical glance round the room\u2014a glance which scathed, or was\r\nintended to scathe, as it crossed me\u2014he fell with fury upon \u201cles Anglaises.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNever have I heard English women handled as M. Paul that morning handled them:\r\nhe spared nothing\u2014neither their minds, morals, manners, nor personal\r\nappearance. I specially remember his abuse of their tall stature, their long\r\nnecks, their thin arms, their slovenly dress, their pedantic education, their\r\nimpious scepticism(!), their insufferable pride, their pretentious virtue: over\r\nwhich he ground his teeth malignantly, and looked as if, had he dared, he would\r\nhave said singular things. Oh! he was spiteful, acrid, savage; and, as a\r\nnatural consequence, detestably ugly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle wicked venomous man!\u201d thought I; \u201cam I going to harass myself with\r\nfears of displeasing you, or hurting your feelings? No, indeed; you shall be\r\nindifferent to me, as the shabbiest bouquet in your pyramid.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI grieve to say I could not quite carry out this resolution. For some time the\r\nabuse of England and the English found and left me stolid: I bore it some\r\nfifteen minutes stoically enough; but this hissing cockatrice was determined to\r\nsting, and he said such things at last\u2014fastening not only upon our women, but\r\nupon our greatest names and best men; sullying, the shield of Britannia, and\r\ndabbling the union jack in mud\u2014that I was stung. With vicious relish he brought\r\nup the most spicy current continental historical falsehoods\u2014than which nothing\r\ncan be conceived more offensive. Z\u00e9lie, and the whole class, became one grin of\r\nvindictive delight; for it is curious to discover how these clowns of\r\nLabassecour secretly hate England. At last, I struck a sharp stroke on my desk,\r\nopened my lips, and let loose this cry:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVive l\u2019Angleterre, l\u2019Histoire et les H\u00e9ros! A bas la France, la Fiction et les\r\nFaquins!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe class was struck of a heap. I suppose they thought me mad. The Professor\r\nput up his handkerchief, and fiendishly smiled into its folds. Little monster\r\nof malice! He now thought he had got the victory, since he had made me angry.\r\nIn a second he became good-humoured. With great blandness he resumed the\r\nsubject of his flowers; talked poetically and symbolically of their sweetness,\r\nperfume, purity, etcetera; made Frenchified comparisons between the \u201cjeunes\r\nfilles\u201d and the sweet blossoms before him; paid Mademoiselle St. Pierre a very\r\nfull-blown compliment on the superiority of her bouquet; and ended by\r\nannouncing that the first really fine, mild, and balmy morning in spring, he\r\nintended to take the whole class out to breakfast in the country. \u201cSuch of the\r\nclass, at least,\u201d he added, with emphasis, \u201cas he could count amongst the\r\nnumber of his friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonc je n\u2019y serai pas,\u201d declared I, involuntarily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoit!\u201d was his response; and, gathering his flowers in his arms, he flashed\r\nout of classe; while I, consigning my work, scissors, thimble, and the\r\nneglected little box, to my desk, swept up-stairs. I don\u2019t know whether\r\nhe felt hot and angry, but I am free to confess that I did.\r\n\n\r\nYet with a strange evanescent anger, I had not sat an hour on the edge of my\r\nbed, picturing and repicturing his look, manner, words ere I smiled at the\r\nwhole scene. A little pang of regret I underwent that the box had not been\r\noffered. I had meant to gratify him. Fate would not have it so.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon, remembering that desks in classe were by no\r\nmeans inviolate repositories, and thinking that it was as well to secure the\r\nbox, on account of the initials in the lid, P. C. D. E., for Paul Carl (or\r\nCarlos) David Emanuel\u2014such was his full name\u2014these foreigners must always have\r\na string of baptismals\u2014I descended to the schoolroom.\r\n\n\r\nIt slept in holiday repose. The day pupils were all gone home, the boarders\r\nwere out walking, the teachers, except the surveillante of the week, were in\r\ntown, visiting or shopping; the suite of divisions was vacant; so was the\r\ngrande salle, with its huge solemn globe hanging in the midst, its pair of\r\nmany-branched chandeliers, and its horizontal grand piano closed, silent,\r\nenjoying its mid-week Sabbath. I rather wondered to find the first classe door\r\najar; this room being usually locked when empty, and being then inaccessible to\r\nany save Madame Beck and myself, who possessed a duplicate key. I wondered\r\nstill more, on approaching, to hear a vague movement as of life\u2014a step, a chair\r\nstirred, a sound like the opening of a desk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is only Madame Beck doing inspection duty,\u201d was the conclusion following a\r\nmoment\u2019s reflection. The partially-opened door gave opportunity for assurance\r\non this point. I looked. Behold! not the inspecting garb of Madame Beck\u2014the\r\nshawl and the clean cap\u2014but the coat, and the close-shorn, dark head of a man.\r\nThis person occupied my chair; his olive hand held my desk open, his nose was\r\nlost to view amongst my papers. His back was towards me, but there could not be\r\na moment\u2019s question about identity. Already was the attire of ceremony\r\ndiscarded: the cherished and ink-stained palet\u00f4t was resumed; the perverse\r\nbonnet-grec lay on the floor, as if just dropped from the hand, culpably busy.\r\n\n\r\nNow I knew, and I had long known, that that hand of M. Emanuel\u2019s was on the\r\nmost intimate terms with my desk; that it raised and lowered the lid, ransacked\r\nand arranged the contents, almost as familiarly as my own. The fact was not\r\ndubious, nor did he wish it to be so: he left signs of each visit palpable and\r\nunmistakable; hitherto, however, I had never caught him in the act: watch as I\r\nwould, I could not detect the hours and moments of his coming. I saw the\r\nbrownie\u2019s work in exercises left overnight full of faults, and found next\r\nmorning carefully corrected: I profited by his capricious good-will in loans\r\nfull welcome and refreshing. Between a sallow dictionary and worn-out grammar\r\nwould magically grow a fresh interesting new work, or a classic, mellow and\r\nsweet in its ripe age. Out of my work-basket would laughingly peep a romance,\r\nunder it would lurk the pamphlet, the magazine, whence last evening\u2019s reading\r\nhad been extracted. Impossible to doubt the source whence these treasures\r\nflowed: had there been no other indication, one condemning and traitor\r\npeculiarity, common to them all, settled the question\u2014they smelt of\r\ncigars. This was very shocking, of course: I thought so at first,\r\nand used to open the window with some bustle, to air my desk, and with\r\nfastidious finger and thumb, to hold the peccant brochures forth to the\r\npurifying breeze. I was cured of that formality suddenly. Monsieur caught me at\r\nit one day, understood the inference, instantly relieved my hand of its burden,\r\nand, in another moment, would have thrust the same into the glowing stove. It\r\nchanced to be a book, on the perusal of which I was bent; so for once I proved\r\nas decided and quicker than himself; recaptured the spoil, and\u2014having saved\r\nthis volume\u2014never hazarded a second. With all this, I had never yet been able\r\nto arrest in his visits the freakish, friendly, cigar-loving phantom.\r\n\n\r\nBut now at last I had him: there he was\u2014the very brownie himself; and there,\r\ncurling from his lips, was the pale blue breath of his Indian darling: he was\r\nsmoking into my desk: it might well betray him. Provoked at this particular,\r\nand yet pleased to surprise him\u2014pleased, that is, with the mixed feeling of the\r\nhousewife who discovers at last her strange elfin ally busy in the dairy at the\r\nuntimely churn\u2014I softly stole forward, stood behind him, bent with precaution\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\n\r\nMy heart smote me to see that\u2014after this morning\u2019s hostility, after my seeming\r\nremissness, after the puncture experienced by his feelings, and the ruffling\r\nundergone by his temper\u2014he, all willing to forget and forgive, had brought me a\r\ncouple of handsome volumes, of which the title and authorship were guarantees\r\nfor interest. Now, as he sat bending above the desk, he was stirring up its\r\ncontents; but with gentle and careful hand; disarranging indeed, but not\r\nharming. My heart smote me: as I bent over him, as he sat unconscious, doing me\r\nwhat good he could, and I daresay not feeling towards me unkindly, my morning\u2019s\r\nanger quite melted: I did not dislike Professor Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nI think he heard me breathe. He turned suddenly: his temperament was nervous,\r\nyet he never started, and seldom changed colour: there was something hardy\r\nabout him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were gone into town with the other teachers,\u201d said he, taking a\r\ngrim gripe of his self-possession, which half-escaped him\u2014\u201cIt is as well you\r\nare not. Do you think I care for being caught? Not I. I often visit your desk.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I know it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou find a brochure or tome now and then; but you don\u2019t read them, because\r\nthey have passed under this?\u201d\u2014touching his cigar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have, and are no better for the process; but I read them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWithout pleasure?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur must not be contradicted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like them, or any of them?\u2014are they acceptable?\u201d \u201cMonsieur has seen me\r\nreading them a hundred times, and knows I have not so many recreations as to\r\nundervalue those he provides.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean well; and, if you see that I mean well, and derive some little\r\namusement from my efforts, why can we not be friends?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA fatalist would say\u2014because we cannot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis morning,\u201d he continued, \u201cI awoke in a bright mood, and came into classe\r\nhappy; you spoiled my day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur, only an hour or two of it, and that unintentionally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnintentionally! No. It was my f\u00eate-day; everybody wished me happiness but\r\nyou. The little children of the third division gave each her knot of violets,\r\nlisped each her congratulation:\u2014you\u2014nothing. Not a bud, leaf, whisper\u2014not a\r\nglance. Was this unintentional?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI meant no harm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you really did not know our custom? You were unprepared? You would\r\nwillingly have laid out a few centimes on a flower to give me pleasure, had you\r\nbeen aware that it was expected? Say so, and all is forgotten, and the pain\r\nsoothed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did know that it was expected: I was prepared; yet I laid out no\r\ncentimes on flowers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well\u2014you do right to be honest. I should almost have hated you had you\r\nflattered and lied. Better declare at once \u2018Paul Carl Emanuel\u2014je te d\u00e9teste,\r\nmon gar\u00e7on!\u2019\u2014than smile an interest, look an affection, and be false and cold\r\nat heart. False and cold I don\u2019t think you are; but you have made a great\r\nmistake in life, that I believe; I think your judgment is warped\u2014that you are\r\nindifferent where you ought to be grateful\u2014and perhaps devoted and infatuated,\r\nwhere you ought to be cool as your name. Don\u2019t suppose that I wish you to have\r\na passion for me, Mademoiselle; Dieu vous en garde! What do you start for?\r\nBecause I said passion? Well, I say it again. There is such a word, and there\r\nis such a thing\u2014though not within these walls, thank heaven! You are no child\r\nthat one should not speak of what exists; but I only uttered the word\u2014the\r\nthing, I assure you, is alien to my whole life and views. It died in the\r\npast\u2014in the present it lies buried\u2014its grave is deep-dug, well-heaped, and many\r\nwinters old: in the future there will be a resurrection, as I believe to my\r\nsouls consolation; but all will then be changed\u2014form and feeling: the mortal\r\nwill have put on immortality\u2014it will rise, not for earth, but heaven. All I say\r\nto you, Miss Lucy Snowe, is\u2014that you ought to treat Professor Paul\r\nEmanuel decently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not, and did not contradict such a sentiment.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he pursued, \u201cwhen it is your f\u00eate-day, and I will not grudge\r\na few centimes for a small offering.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will be like me, Monsieur: this cost more than a few centimes, and I did\r\nnot grudge its price.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd taking from the open desk the little box, I put it into his hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt lay ready in my lap this morning,\u201d I continued; \u201cand if Monsieur had been\r\nrather more patient, and Mademoiselle St. Pierre less interfering\u2014perhaps I\r\nshould say, too, if I had been calmer and wiser\u2014I should have given it\r\nthen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at the box: I saw its clear warm tint and bright azure circlet\r\npleased his eyes. I told him to open it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy initials!\u201d said he, indicating the letters in the lid. \u201cWho told you I was\r\ncalled Carl David?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little bird, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes it fly from me to you? Then one can tie a message under its wing when\r\nneedful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took out the chain\u2014a trifle indeed as to value, but glossy with silk and\r\nsparkling with beads. He liked that too\u2014admired it artlessly, like a child.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is the thing you were working at last night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou finished it this morning?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou commenced it with the intention that it should be mine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd offered on my f\u00eate-day?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis purpose continued as you wove it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I assented.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen it is not necessary that I should cut out any portion\u2014saying, this part\r\nis not mine: it was plaited under the idea and for the adornment of another?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means. It is neither necessary, nor would it be just.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis object is all mine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat object is yours entirely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStraightway Monsieur opened his palet\u00f4t, arranged the guard splendidly across\r\nhis chest, displaying as much and suppressing as little as he could: for he had\r\nno notion of concealing what he admired and thought decorative. As to the box,\r\nhe pronounced it a superb bonbonni\u00e8re\u2014he was fond of bonbons, by the way\u2014and as\r\nhe always liked to share with others what pleased himself, he would give his\r\n\u201cdrag\u00e9es\u201d as freely as he lent his books. Amongst the kind brownie\u2019s gifts left\r\nin my desk, I forgot to enumerate many a paper of chocolate comfits. His tastes\r\nin these matters were southern, and what we think infantine. His simple lunch\r\nconsisted frequently of a \u201cbrioche,\u201d which, as often as not, he shared with\r\nsome child of the third division.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA pr\u00e9sent c\u2019est un fait accompli,\u201d said he, re-adjusting his palet\u00f4t; and we\r\nhad no more words on the subject. After looking over the two volumes he had\r\nbrought, and cutting away some pages with his penknife (he generally pruned\r\nbefore lending his books, especially if they were novels, and sometimes I was a\r\nlittle provoked at the severity of his censorship, the retrenchments\r\ninterrupting the narrative), he rose, politely touched his bonnet-grec, and\r\nbade me a civil good-day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe are friends now,\u201d thought I, \u201ctill the next time we quarrel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe might have quarrelled again that very same evening, but, wonderful to\r\nrelate, failed, for once, to make the most of our opportunity.\r\n\n\r\nContrary to all expectation, M. Paul arrived at the study-hour. Having seen so\r\nmuch of him in the morning, we did not look for his presence at night. No\r\nsooner were we seated at lessons, however, than he appeared. I own I was glad\r\nto see him, so glad that I could not help greeting his arrival with a smile;\r\nand when he made his way to the same seat about which so serious a\r\nmisunderstanding had formerly arisen, I took good care not to make too much\r\nroom for him; he watched with a jealous, side-long look, to see whether I\r\nshrank away, but I did not, though the bench was a little crowded. I was losing\r\nthe early impulse to recoil from M. Paul. Habituated to the palet\u00f4t and\r\nbonnet-grec, the neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable\r\nor very formidable. I did not now sit restrained, \u201casphyxi\u00e9e\u201d (as he used to\r\nsay) at his side; I stirred when I wished to stir, coughed when it was\r\nnecessary, even yawned when I was tired\u2014did, in short, what I pleased, blindly\r\nreliant upon his indulgence. Nor did my temerity, this evening at least, meet\r\nthe punishment it perhaps merited; he was both indulgent and good-natured; not\r\na cross glance shot from his eyes, not a hasty word left his lips. Till the\r\nvery close of the evening, he did not indeed address me at all, yet I felt,\r\nsomehow, that he was full of friendliness. Silence is of different kinds, and\r\nbreathes different meanings; no words could inspire a pleasanter content than\r\ndid M. Paul\u2019s worldless presence. When the tray came in, and the bustle of\r\nsupper commenced, he just said, as he retired, that he wished me a good night\r\nand sweet dreams; and a good night and sweet dreams I had.\r\n\n"}
{"31": "\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nM. PAUL.\n\r\nYet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his kindly conclusions,\r\nor to suppose, with an over-hasty charity, that from that day M. Paul became a\r\nchanged character\u2014easy to live with, and no longer apt to flash danger and\r\ndiscomfort round him.\r\n\n\r\nNo; he was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods. When over-wrought,\r\nwhich he often was, he became acutely irritable; and, besides, his veins were\r\ndark with a livid belladonna tincture, the essence of jealousy. I do not mean\r\nmerely the tender jealousy of the heart, but that sterner, narrower sentiment\r\nwhose seat is in the head.\r\n\n\r\nI used to think, as I sat looking at M. Paul, while he was knitting his brow or\r\nprotruding his lip over some exercise of mine, which had not as many faults as\r\nhe wished (for he liked me to commit faults: a knot of blunders was sweet to\r\nhim as a cluster of nuts), that he had points of resemblance to Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. I think so still.\r\n\n\r\nIn a shameless disregard of magnanimity, he resembled the great Emperor. M.\r\nPaul would have quarrelled with twenty learned women, would have unblushingly\r\ncarried on a system of petty bickering and recrimination with a whole capital\r\nof coteries, never troubling himself about loss or lack of dignity. He would\r\nhave exiled fifty Madame de Sta\u00ebls, if they had annoyed, offended,\r\noutrivalled, or opposed him.\r\n\n\r\nI well remember a hot episode of his with a certain Madame Panache\u2014a lady\r\ntemporarily employed by Madame Beck to give lessons in history. She was\r\nclever\u2014that is, she knew a good deal; and, besides, thoroughly possessed the\r\nart of making the most of what she knew; of words and confidence she held\r\nunlimited command. Her personal appearance was far from destitute of\r\nadvantages; I believe many people would have pronounced her \u201ca fine woman;\u201d and\r\nyet there were points in her robust and ample attractions, as well as in her\r\nbustling and demonstrative presence, which, it appeared, the nice and\r\ncapricious tastes of M. Paul could not away with. The sound of her voice,\r\nechoing through the carr\u00e9, would put him into a strange taking; her long free\r\nstep\u2014almost stride\u2014along the corridor, would often make him snatch up his\r\npapers and decamp on the instant.\r\n\n\r\nWith malicious intent he bethought himself, one day, to intrude on her class;\r\nas quick as lightning he gathered her method of instruction; it differed from a\r\npet plan of his own. With little ceremony, and less courtesy, he pointed out\r\nwhat he termed her errors. Whether he expected submission and attention, I know\r\nnot; he met an acrid opposition, accompanied by a round reprimand for his\r\ncertainly unjustifiable interference.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of withdrawing with dignity, as he might still have done, he threw down\r\nthe gauntlet of defiance. Madame Panache, bellicose as a Penthesilea, picked it\r\nup in a minute. She snapped her fingers in the intermeddler\u2019s face; she rushed\r\nupon him with a storm of words. M. Emanuel was eloquent; but Madame Panache was\r\nvoluble. A system of fierce antagonism ensued. Instead of laughing in his\r\nsleeve at his fair foe, with all her sore amour-propre and loud self-assertion,\r\nM. Paul detested her with intense seriousness; he honoured her with his earnest\r\nfury; he pursued her vindictively and implacably, refusing to rest peaceably in\r\nhis bed, to derive due benefit from his meals, or even serenely to relish his\r\ncigar, till she was fairly rooted out of the establishment. The Professor\r\nconquered, but I cannot say that the laurels of this victory shadowed\r\ngracefully his temples. Once I ventured to hint as much. To my great surprise\r\nhe allowed that I might be right, but averred that when brought into contact\r\nwith either men or women of the coarse, self-complacent quality, whereof Madame\r\nPanache was a specimen, he had no control over his own passions; an unspeakable\r\nand active aversion impelled him to a war of extermination.\r\n\n\r\nThree months afterwards, hearing that his vanquished foe had met with reverses,\r\nand was likely to be really distressed for want of employment, he forgot his\r\nhatred, and alike active in good and evil, he moved heaven and earth till he\r\nfound her a place. Upon her coming to make up former differences, and thank him\r\nfor his recent kindness, the old voice\u2014a little loud\u2014the old manner\u2014a little\r\nforward\u2014so acted upon him that in ten minutes he started up and bowed her, or\r\nrather himself, out of the room, in a transport of nervous irritation.\r\n\n\r\nTo pursue a somewhat audacious parallel, in a love of power, in an eager grasp\r\nafter supremacy, M. Emanuel was like Bonaparte. He was a man not always to be\r\nsubmitted to. Sometimes it was needful to resist; it was right to stand still,\r\nto look up into his eyes and tell him that his requirements went beyond\r\nreason\u2014that his absolutism verged on tyranny.\r\n\n\r\nThe dawnings, the first developments of peculiar talent appearing within his\r\nrange, and under his rule, curiously excited, even disturbed him. He watched\r\nits struggle into life with a scowl; he held back his hand\u2014perhaps said, \u201cCome\r\non if you have strength,\u201d but would not aid the birth.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the pang and peril of the first conflict were over, when the breath of\r\nlife was drawn, when he saw the lungs expand and contract, when he felt the\r\nheart beat and discovered life in the eye, he did not yet offer to foster.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProve yourself true ere I cherish you,\u201d was his ordinance; and how difficult\r\nhe made that proof! What thorns and briers, what flints, he strewed in the path\r\nof feet not inured to rough travel! He watched tearlessly\u2014ordeals that he\r\nexacted should be passed through\u2014fearlessly. He followed footprints that, as\r\nthey approached the bourne, were sometimes marked in blood\u2014followed them\r\ngrimly, holding the austerest police-watch over the pain-pressed pilgrim. And\r\nwhen at last he allowed a rest, before slumber might close the eyelids, he\r\nopened those same lids wide, with pitiless finger and thumb, and gazed deep\r\nthrough the pupil and the irids into the brain, into the heart, to search if\r\nVanity, or Pride, or Falsehood, in any of its subtlest forms, was discoverable\r\nin the furthest recess of existence. If, at last, he let the neophyte sleep, it\r\nwas but a moment; he woke him suddenly up to apply new tests: he sent him on\r\nirksome errands when he was staggering with weariness; he tried the temper, the\r\nsense, and the health; and it was only when every severest test had been\r\napplied and endured, when the most corrosive aquafortis had been used, and\r\nfailed to tarnish the ore, that he admitted it genuine, and, still in clouded\r\nsilence, stamped it with his deep brand of approval.\r\n\n\r\nI speak not ignorant of these evils.\r\n\n\r\nTill the date at which the last chapter closes, M. Paul had not been my\r\nprofessor\u2014he had not given me lessons, but about that time, accidentally\r\nhearing me one day acknowledge an ignorance of some branch of education (I\r\nthink it was arithmetic), which would have disgraced a charity-school boy, as\r\nhe very truly remarked, he took me in hand, examined me first, found me, I need\r\nnot say, abundantly deficient, gave me some books and appointed me some tasks.\r\n\n\r\nHe did this at first with pleasure, indeed with unconcealed exultation,\r\ncondescending to say that he believed I was \u201cbonne et pas trop faible\u201d (i.e.\r\nwell enough disposed, and not wholly destitute of parts), but, owing he\r\nsupposed to adverse circumstances, \u201cas yet in a state of wretchedly imperfect\r\nmental development.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe beginning of all effort has indeed with me been marked by a preternatural\r\nimbecility. I never could, even in forming a common acquaintance, assert or\r\nprove a claim to average quickness. A depressing and difficult passage has\r\nprefaced every new page I have turned in life.\r\n\n\r\nSo long as this passage lasted, M. Paul was very kind, very good, very\r\nforbearing; he saw the sharp pain inflicted, and felt the weighty humiliation\r\nimposed by my own sense of incapacity; and words can hardly do justice to his\r\ntenderness and helpfulness. His own eyes would moisten, when tears of shame and\r\neffort clouded mine; burdened as he was with work, he would steal half his\r\nbrief space of recreation to give to me.\r\n\n\r\nBut, strange grief! when that heavy and overcast dawn began at last to yield to\r\nday; when my faculties began to struggle themselves, free, and my time of\r\nenergy and fulfilment came; when I voluntarily doubled, trebled, quadrupled the\r\ntasks he set, to please him as I thought, his kindness became sternness; the\r\nlight changed in his eyes from a beam to a spark; he fretted, he opposed, he\r\ncurbed me imperiously; the more I did, the harder I worked, the less he seemed\r\ncontent. Sarcasms of which the severity amazed and puzzled me, harassed my\r\nears; then flowed out the bitterest inuendoes against the \u201cpride of intellect.\u201d\r\nI was vaguely threatened with I know not what doom, if I ever trespassed the\r\nlimits proper to my sex, and conceived a contraband appetite for unfeminine\r\nknowledge. Alas! I had no such appetite. What I loved, it joyed me by any\r\neffort to content; but the noble hunger for science in the abstract\u2014the godlike\r\nthirst after discovery\u2014these feelings were known to me but by briefest flashes.\r\n\n\r\nYet, when M. Paul sneered at me, I wanted to possess them more fully; his\r\ninjustice stirred in me ambitious wishes\u2014it imparted a strong stimulus\u2014it gave\r\nwings to aspiration.\r\n\n\r\nIn the beginning, before I had penetrated to motives, that uncomprehended sneer\r\nof his made my heart ache, but by-and-by it only warmed the blood in my veins,\r\nand sent added action to my pulses. Whatever my powers\u2014feminine or the\r\ncontrary\u2014God had given them, and I felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of\r\nhis bestowal.\r\n\n\r\nThe combat was very sharp for a time. I seemed to have lost M. Paul\u2019s\r\naffection; he treated me strangely. In his most unjust moments he would\r\ninsinuate that I had deceived him when I appeared, what he called \u201cfaible\u201d\u2014that\r\nis incompetent; he said I had feigned a false incapacity. Again, he would turn\r\nsuddenly round and accuse me of the most far-fetched imitations and impossible\r\nplagiarisms, asserting that I had extracted the pith out of books I had not so\r\nmuch as heard of\u2014and over the perusal of which I should infallibly have fallen\r\ndown in a sleep as deep as that of Eutychus.\r\n\n\r\nOnce, upon his preferring such an accusation, I turned upon him\u2014I rose against\r\nhim. Gathering an armful of his books out of my desk, I filled my apron and\r\npoured them in a heap upon his estrade, at his feet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake them away, M. Paul,\u201d I said, \u201cand teach me no more. I never asked to be\r\nmade learned, and you compel me to feel very profoundly that learning is not\r\nhappiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd returning to my desk, I laid my head on my arms, nor would I speak to him\r\nfor two days afterwards. He pained and chagrined me. His affection had been\r\nvery sweet and dear\u2014a pleasure new and incomparable: now that this seemed\r\nwithdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.\r\n\n\r\nThe books, however, were not taken away; they were all restored with careful\r\nhand to their places, and he came as usual to teach me. He made his peace\r\nsomehow\u2014too readily, perhaps: I ought to have stood out longer, but when he\r\nlooked kind and good, and held out his hand with amity, memory refused to\r\nreproduce with due force his oppressive moments. And then, reconcilement is\r\nalways sweet!\r\n\n\r\nOn a certain morning a message came from my godmother, inviting me to attend\r\nsome notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms before described.\r\nDr. John had brought the message himself, and delivered it verbally to Rosine,\r\nwho had not scrupled to follow the steps of M. Emanuel, then passing to the\r\nfirst classe, and, in his presence, stand \u201ccarr\u00e9ment\u201d before my desk, hand in\r\napron-pocket, and rehearse the same, saucily and aloud, concluding with the\r\nwords, \u201cQu\u2019il est vraiment beau, Mademoiselle, ce jeune docteur! Quels\r\nyeux\u2014quel regard! Tenez! J\u2019en ai le c\u0153ur tout \u00e9mu!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen she was gone, my professor demanded of me why I suffered \u201ccette fille\r\neffront\u00e9e, cette cr\u00e9ature sans pudeur,\u201d to address me in such terms.\r\n\n\r\nI had no pacifying answer to give. The terms were precisely such as Rosine\u2014a\r\nyoung lady in whose skull the organs of reverence and reserve were not largely\r\ndeveloped\u2014was in the constant habit of using. Besides, what she said about the\r\nyoung doctor was true enough. Graham was handsome; he had fine eyes and\r\na thrilling glance. An observation to that effect actually formed itself into\r\nsound on my lips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElle ne dit que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! vous trouvez?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, sans doute.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe lesson to which we had that day to submit was such as to make us very glad\r\nwhen it terminated. At its close, the released pupils rushed out,\r\nhalf-trembling, half-exultant. I, too, was going. A mandate to remain arrested\r\nme. I muttered that I wanted some fresh air sadly\u2014the stove was in a glow, the\r\nclasse over-heated. An inexorable voice merely recommended silence; and this\r\nsalamander\u2014for whom no room ever seemed too hot\u2014sitting down between my desk\r\nand the stove\u2014a situation in which he ought to have felt broiled, but did\r\nnot\u2014proceeded to confront me with\u2014a Greek quotation!\r\n\n\r\nIn M. Emanuel\u2019s soul rankled a chronic suspicion that I knew both Greek and\r\nLatin. As monkeys are said to have the power of speech if they would but use\r\nit, and are reported to conceal this faculty in fear of its being turned to\r\ntheir detriment, so to me was ascribed a fund of knowledge which I was supposed\r\ncriminally and craftily to conceal. The privileges of a \u201cclassical education,\u201d\r\nit was insinuated, had been mine; on flowers of Hymettus I had revelled; a\r\ngolden store, hived in memory, now silently sustained my efforts, and privily\r\nnurtured my wits.\r\n\n\r\nA hundred expedients did M. Paul employ to surprise my secret\u2014to wheedle, to\r\nthreaten, to startle it out of me. Sometimes he placed Greek and Latin books in\r\nmy way, and then watched me, as Joan of Arc\u2019s jailors tempted her with the\r\nwarrior\u2019s accoutrements, and lay in wait for the issue. Again he quoted I know\r\nnot what authors and passages, and while rolling out their sweet and sounding\r\nlines (the classic tones fell musically from his lips\u2014for he had a good\r\nvoice\u2014remarkable for compass, modulation, and matchless expression), he would\r\nfix on me a vigilant, piercing, and often malicious eye. It was evident he\r\nsometimes expected great demonstrations; they never occurred, however; not\r\ncomprehending, of course I could neither be charmed nor annoyed.\r\n\n\r\nBaffled\u2014almost angry\u2014he still clung to his fixed idea; my susceptibilities were\r\npronounced marble\u2014my face a mask. It appeared as if he could not be brought to\r\naccept the homely truth, and take me for what I was: men, and women too, must\r\nhave delusion of some sort; if not made ready to their hand, they will invent\r\nexaggeration for themselves.\r\n\n\r\nAt moments I did wish that his suspicions had been better founded. There\r\nwere times when I would have given my right hand to possess the treasures he\r\nascribed to me. He deserved condign punishment for his testy crotchets. I could\r\nhave gloried in bringing home to him his worst apprehensions astoundingly\r\nrealized. I could have exulted to burst on his vision, confront and confound\r\nhis \u201clunettes,\u201d one blaze of acquirements. Oh! why did nobody undertake to make\r\nme clever while I was young enough to learn, that I might, by one grand,\r\nsudden, inhuman revelation\u2014one cold, cruel, overwhelming triumph\u2014have for ever\r\ncrushed the mocking spirit out of Paul Carl David Emanuel!\r\n\n\r\nAlas! no such feat was in my power. To-day, as usual, his quotations fell\r\nineffectual: he soon shifted his ground.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWomen of intellect\u201d was his next theme: here he was at home. A \u201cwoman of\r\nintellect,\u201d it appeared, was a sort of \u201clusus naturae,\u201d a luckless accident, a\r\nthing for which there was neither place nor use in creation, wanted neither as\r\nwife nor worker. Beauty anticipated her in the first office. He believed in his\r\nsoul that lovely, placid, and passive feminine mediocrity was the only pillow\r\non which manly thought and sense could find rest for its aching temples; and as\r\nto work, male mind alone could work to any good practical result\u2014hein?\r\n\n\r\nThis \u201chein?\u201d was a note of interrogation intended to draw from me contradiction\r\nor objection. However, I only said\u2014\u201cCela ne me regarde pas: je ne m\u2019en soucie\r\npas;\u201d and presently added\u2014\u201cMay I go, Monsieur? They have rung the bell for the\r\nsecond d\u00e9jeuner\u201d (i.e. luncheon).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat of that? You are not hungry?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I was,\u201d I said; \u201cI had had nothing since breakfast, at seven, and\r\nshould have nothing till dinner, at five, if I missed this bell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, he was in the same plight, but I might share with him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he broke in two the \u201cbrioche\u201d intended for his own refreshment, and gave me\r\nhalf. Truly his bark was worse than his bite; but the really formidable attack\r\nwas yet to come. While eating his cake, I could not forbear expressing my\r\nsecret wish that I really knew all of which he accused me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I sincerely feel myself to be an ignoramus?\u201d he asked, in a softened tone.\r\n\n\r\nIf I had replied meekly by an unqualified affirmative, I believe he would have\r\nstretched out his hand, and we should have been friends on the spot, but I\r\nanswered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. I am ignorant, Monsieur, in the knowledge you ascribe to me, but\r\nI sometimes, not always, feel a knowledge of my own.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I mean?\u201d he inquired, sharply.\r\n\n\r\nUnable to answer this question in a breath, I evaded it by change of subject.\r\nHe had now finished his half of the brioche: feeling sure that on so trifling a\r\nfragment he could not have satisfied his appetite, as indeed I had not appeased\r\nmine, and inhaling the fragrance of baked apples afar from the refectory, I\r\nventured to inquire whether he did not also perceive that agreeable odour. He\r\nconfessed that he did. I said if he would let me out by the garden-door, and\r\npermit me just to run across the court, I would fetch him a plateful; and added\r\nthat I believed they were excellent, as Goton had a very good method of baking,\r\nor rather stewing fruit, putting in a little spice, sugar, and a glass or two\r\nof vin blanc\u2014might I go?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite gourmande!\u201d said he, smiling, \u201cI have not forgotten how pleased you\r\nwere with the p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e2 la cr\u00eame I once gave you, and you know very well, at this\r\nmoment, that to fetch the apples for me will be the same as getting them for\r\nyourself. Go, then, but come back quickly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd at last he liberated me on parole. My own plan was to go and return with\r\nspeed and good faith, to put the plate in at the door, and then to vanish\r\nincontinent, leaving all consequences for future settlement.\r\n\n\r\nThat intolerably keen instinct of his seemed to have anticipated my scheme: he\r\nmet me at the threshold, hurried me into the room, and fixed me in a minute in\r\nmy former seat. Taking the plate of fruit from my hand, he divided the portion\r\nintended only for himself, and ordered me to eat my share. I complied with no\r\ngood grace, and vexed, I suppose, by my reluctance, he opened a masked and\r\ndangerous battery. All he had yet said, I could count as mere sound and fury,\r\nsignifying nothing: not so of the present attack.\r\n\n\r\nIt consisted in an unreasonable proposition with which he had before afflicted\r\nme: namely, that on the next public examination-day I should engage\u2014foreigner\r\nas I was\u2014to take my place on the first form of first-class pupils, and with\r\nthem improvise a composition in French, on any subject any spectator might\r\ndictate, without benefit of grammar or lexicon.\r\n\n\r\nI knew what the result of such an experiment would be. I, to whom nature had\r\ndenied the impromptu faculty; who, in public, was by nature a cypher; whose\r\ntime of mental activity, even when alone, was not under the meridian sun; who\r\nneeded the fresh silence of morning, or the recluse peace of evening, to win\r\nfrom the Creative Impulse one evidence of his presence, one proof of his force;\r\nI, with whom that Impulse was the most intractable, the most capricious, the\r\nmost maddening of masters (him before me always excepted)\u2014a deity which\r\nsometimes, under circumstances\u2014apparently propitious, would not speak when\r\nquestioned, would not hear when appealed to, would not, when sought, be found;\r\nbut would stand, all cold, all indurated, all granite, a dark Baal with carven\r\nlips and blank eye-balls, and breast like the stone face of a tomb; and again,\r\nsuddenly, at some turn, some sound, some long-trembling sob of the wind, at\r\nsome rushing past of an unseen stream of electricity, the irrational demon\r\nwould wake unsolicited, would stir strangely alive, would rush from its\r\npedestal like a perturbed Dagon, calling to its votary for a sacrifice,\r\nwhatever the hour\u2014to its victim for some blood, or some breath, whatever the\r\ncircumstance or scene\u2014rousing its priest, treacherously promising vaticination,\r\nperhaps filling its temple with a strange hum of oracles, but sure to give half\r\nthe significance to fateful winds, and grudging to the desperate listener even\r\na miserable remnant\u2014yielding it sordidly, as though each word had been a drop\r\nof the deathless ichor of its own dark veins. And this tyrant I was to compel\r\ninto bondage, and make it improvise a theme, on a school estrade, between a\r\nMathilde and a Coralie, under the eye of a Madame Beck, for the pleasure, and\r\nto the inspiration of a bourgeois of Labassecour!\r\n\n\r\nUpon this argument M. Paul and I did battle more than once\u2014strong battle, with\r\nconfused noise of demand and rejection, exaction and repulse.\r\n\n\r\nOn this particular day I was soundly rated. \u201cThe obstinacy of my whole sex,\u201d it\r\nseems, was concentrated in me; I had an \u201corgueil de diable.\u201d I feared to fail,\r\nforsooth! What did it matter whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should\r\nnot fail, like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He wanted to see me\r\nworsted (I knew he did), and one minute he paused to take breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould I speak now, and be tractable?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever would I be tractable in this matter. Law itself should not compel me. I\r\nwould pay a fine, or undergo an imprisonment, rather than write for a show and\r\nto order, perched up on a platform.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould softer motives influence me? Would I yield for friendship\u2019s sake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a whit, not a hair-breadth. No form of friendship under the sun had a\r\nright to exact such a concession. No true friendship would harass me thus.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe supposed then (with a sneer\u2014M. Paul could sneer supremely, curling his lip,\r\nopening his nostrils, contracting his eyelids)\u2014he supposed there was but one\r\nform of appeal to which I would listen, and of that form it was not for him to\r\nmake use.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnder certain persuasions, from certain quarters, je vous vois d\u2019ici,\u201d said\r\nhe, \u201ceagerly subscribing to the sacrifice, passionately arming for the effort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMaking a simpleton, a warning, and an example of myself, before a hundred and\r\nfifty of the \u2018papas\u2019 and \u2018mammas\u2019 of Villette.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd here, losing patience, I broke out afresh with a cry that I wanted to be\r\nliberated\u2014to get out into the air\u2014I was almost in a fever.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChut!\u201d said the inexorable, \u201cthis was a mere pretext to run away; he\r\nwas not hot, with the stove close at his back; how could I suffer, thoroughly\r\nscreened by his person?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not understand his constitution. I knew nothing of the natural history\r\nof salamanders. For my own part, I was a phlegmatic islander, and sitting in an\r\noven did not agree with me; at least, might I step to the well, and get a glass\r\nof water\u2014the sweet apples had made me thirsty?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf that was all, he would do my errand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe went to fetch the water. Of course, with a door only on the latch behind me,\r\nI lost not my opportunity. Ere his return, his half-worried prey had escaped.\r\n\n"}
{"32": "\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE DRYAD.\n\r\nThe spring was advancing, and the weather had turned suddenly warm. This change\r\nof temperature brought with it for me, as probably for many others, temporary\r\ndecrease of strength. Slight exertion at this time left me overcome with\r\nfatigue\u2014sleepless nights entailed languid days.\r\n\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, having walked the distance of half a league to the\r\nProtestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking refuge in my\r\nsolitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit down, and to make of my\r\ndesk a pillow for my arms and head.\r\n\n\r\nAwhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau, and watched,\r\nthrough the glass door and the tender, lightly-strewn spring foliage, Madame\r\nBeck and a gay party of friends, whom she had entertained that day at dinner\r\nafter morning mass, walking in the centre-alley under orchard boughs dressed at\r\nthis season in blossom, and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as\r\nmountain-snow at sun-rise.\r\n\n\r\nMy principal attraction towards this group of guests lay, I remember, in one\r\nfigure\u2014that of a handsome young girl whom I had seen before as a visitor at\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s, and of whom I had been vaguely told that she was a \u201cfilleule,\u201d\r\nor god-daughter, of M. Emanuel\u2019s, and that between her mother, or aunt, or some\r\nother female relation of hers, and the Professor, had existed of old a special\r\nfriendship. M. Paul was not of the holiday band to-day, but I had seen this\r\nyoung girl with him ere now, and as far as distant observation could enable me\r\nto judge, she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with an\r\nindulgent guardian. I had seen her run up to him, put her arm through his, and\r\nhang upon him. Once, when she did so, a curious sensation had struck through\r\nme\u2014a disagreeable anticipatory sensation\u2014one of the family of presentiments, I\r\nsuppose\u2014but I refused to analyze or dwell upon it. While watching this girl,\r\nMademoiselle Sauveur by name, and following the gleam of her bright silk robe\r\n(she was always richly dressed, for she was said to be wealthy) through the\r\nflowers and the glancing leaves of tender emerald, my eyes became dazzled\u2014they\r\nclosed; my lassitude, the warmth of the day, the hum of bees and birds, all\r\nlulled me, and at last I slept.\r\n\n\r\nTwo hours stole over me. Ere I woke, the sun had declined out of sight behind\r\nthe towering houses, the garden and the room were grey, bees had gone homeward,\r\nand the flowers were closing; the party of guests, too, had vanished; each\r\nalley was void.\r\n\n\r\nOn waking, I felt much at ease\u2014not chill, as I ought to have been after sitting\r\nso still for at least two hours; my cheek and arms were not benumbed by\r\npressure against the hard desk. No wonder. Instead of the bare wood on which I\r\nhad laid them, I found a thick shawl, carefully folded, substituted for\r\nsupport, and another shawl (both taken from the corridor where such things\r\nhung) wrapped warmly round me.\r\n\n\r\nWho had done this? Who was my friend? Which of the teachers? Which of the\r\npupils? None, except St. Pierre, was inimical to me; but which of them had the\r\nart, the thought, the habit, of benefiting thus tenderly? Which of them had a\r\nstep so quiet, a hand so gentle, but I should have heard or felt her, if she\r\nhad approached or touched me in a day-sleep?\r\n\n\r\nAs to Ginevra Fanshawe, that bright young creature was not gentle at all, and\r\nwould certainly have pulled me out of my chair, if she had meddled in the\r\nmatter. I said at last: \u201cIt is Madame Beck\u2019s doing; she has come in, seen me\r\nasleep, and thought I might take cold. She considers me a useful machine,\r\nanswering well the purpose for which it was hired; so would not have me\r\nneedlessly injured. And now,\u201d methought, \u201cI\u2019ll take a walk; the evening is\r\nfresh, and not very chill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I opened the glass door and stepped into the berceau.\r\n\n\r\nI went to my own alley: had it been dark, or even dusk, I should have hardly\r\nventured there, for I had not yet forgotten the curious illusion of vision (if\r\nillusion it were) experienced in that place some months ago. But a ray of the\r\nsetting sun burnished still the grey crown of Jean Baptiste; nor had all the\r\nbirds of the garden yet vanished into their nests amongst the tufted shrubs and\r\nthick wall-ivy. I paced up and down, thinking almost the same thoughts I had\r\npondered that night when I buried my glass jar\u2014how I should make some advance\r\nin life, take another step towards an independent position; for this train of\r\nreflection, though not lately pursued, had never by me been wholly abandoned;\r\nand whenever a certain eye was averted from me, and a certain countenance grew\r\ndark with unkindness and injustice, into that track of speculation did I at\r\nonce strike; so that, little by little, I had laid half a plan.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLiving costs little,\u201d said I to myself, \u201cin this economical town of Villette,\r\nwhere people are more sensible than I understand they are in dear old\r\nEngland\u2014infinitely less worried about appearance, and less emulous of\r\ndisplay\u2014where nobody is in the least ashamed to be quite as homely and saving\r\nas he finds convenient. House-rent, in a prudently chosen situation, need not\r\nbe high. When I shall have saved one thousand francs, I will take a tenement\r\nwith one large room, and two or three smaller ones, furnish the first with a\r\nfew benches and desks, a black tableau, an estrade for myself; upon it a chair\r\nand table, with a sponge and some white chalks; begin with taking day-pupils,\r\nand so work my way upwards. Madame Beck\u2019s commencement was\u2014as I have often\r\nheard her say\u2014from no higher starting-point, and where is she now? All these\r\npremises and this garden are hers, bought with her money; she has a competency\r\nalready secured for old age, and a flourishing establishment under her\r\ndirection, which will furnish a career for her children.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCourage, Lucy Snowe! With self-denial and economy now, and steady exertion\r\nby-and-by, an object in life need not fail you. Venture not to complain that\r\nsuch an object is too selfish, too limited, and lacks interest; be content to\r\nlabour for independence until you have proved, by winning that prize, your\r\nright to look higher. But afterwards, is there nothing more for me in life\u2014no\r\ntrue home\u2014nothing to be dearer to me than myself, and by its paramount\r\npreciousness, to draw from me better things than I care to culture for myself\r\nonly? Nothing, at whose feet I can willingly lay down the whole burden of human\r\negotism, and gloriously take up the nobler charge of labouring and living for\r\nothers? I suppose, Lucy Snowe, the orb of your life is not to be so rounded:\r\nfor you, the crescent-phase must suffice. Very good. I see a huge mass of my\r\nfellow-creatures in no better circumstances. I see that a great many men, and\r\nmore women, hold their span of life on conditions of denial and privation. I\r\nfind no reason why I should be of the few favoured. I believe in some blending\r\nof hope and sunshine sweetening the worst lots. I believe that this life is not\r\nall; neither the beginning nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust\r\nwhile I weep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo this subject is done with. It is right to look our life-accounts bravely in\r\nthe face now and then, and settle them honestly. And he is a poor self-swindler\r\nwho lies to himself while he reckons the items, and sets down under the\r\nhead\u2014happiness that which is misery. Call anguish\u2014anguish, and despair\u2014despair;\r\nwrite both down in strong characters with a resolute pen: you will the better\r\npay your debt to Doom. Falsify: insert \u201cprivilege\u201d where you should have\r\nwritten \u201cpain;\u201d and see if your mighty creditor will allow the fraud to pass,\r\nor accept the coin with which you would cheat him. Offer to the strongest\u2014if\r\nthe darkest angel of God\u2019s host\u2014water, when he has asked blood\u2014will he take it?\r\nNot a whole pale sea for one red drop. I settled another account.\r\n\n\r\nPausing before Methusaleh\u2014the giant and patriarch of the garden\u2014and leaning my\r\nbrow against his knotty trunk, my foot rested on the stone sealing the small\r\nsepulchre at his root; and I recalled the passage of feeling therein buried; I\r\nrecalled Dr. John; my warm affection for him; my faith in his excellence; my\r\ndelight in his grace. What was become of that curious one-sided friendship\r\nwhich was half marble and half life; only on one hand truth, and on the other\r\nperhaps a jest?\r\n\n\r\nWas this feeling dead? I do not know, but it was buried. Sometimes I thought\r\nthe tomb unquiet, and dreamed strangely of disturbed earth, and of hair, still\r\ngolden, and living, obtruded through coffin-chinks.\r\n\n\r\nHad I been too hasty? I used to ask myself; and this question would occur with\r\na cruel sharpness after some brief chance interview with Dr. John. He had still\r\nsuch kind looks, such a warm hand; his voice still kept so pleasant a tone for\r\nmy name; I never liked \u201cLucy\u201d so well as when he uttered it. But I learned in\r\ntime that this benignity, this cordiality, this music, belonged in no shape to\r\nme: it was a part of himself; it was the honey of his temper; it was the balm\r\nof his mellow mood; he imparted it, as the ripe fruit rewards with sweetness\r\nthe rifling bee; he diffused it about him, as sweet plants shed their perfume.\r\nDoes the nectarine love either the bee or bird it feeds? Is the sweetbriar\r\nenamoured of the air?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.\r\nGood-night, and God bless you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus I closed my musings. \u201cGood-night\u201d left my lips in sound; I heard the words\r\nspoken, and then I heard an echo\u2014quite close.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mademoiselle; or, rather, good-evening\u2014the sun is scarce set; I\r\nhope you slept well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI started, but was only discomposed a moment; I knew the voice and speaker.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSlept, Monsieur! When? where?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may well inquire when\u2014where. It seems you turn day into night, and choose\r\na desk for a pillow; rather hard lodging\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was softened for me, Monsieur, while I slept. That unseen, gift-bringing\r\nthing which haunts my desk, remembered me. No matter how I fell asleep; I awoke\r\npillowed and covered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid the shawls keep you warm?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery warm. Do you ask thanks for them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. You looked pale in your slumbers: are you home-sick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be home-sick, one must have a home; which I have not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you have more need of a careful friend. I scarcely know any one, Miss\r\nLucy, who needs a friend more absolutely than you; your very faults\r\nimperatively require it. You want so much checking, regulating, and keeping\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis idea of \u201ckeeping down\u201d never left M. Paul\u2019s head; the most habitual\r\nsubjugation would, in my case, have failed to relieve him of it. No matter;\r\nwhat did it signify? I listened to him, and did not trouble myself to be too\r\nsubmissive; his occupation would have been gone had I left him nothing to \u201ckeep\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need watching, and watching over,\u201d he pursued; \u201cand it is well for you\r\nthat I see this, and do my best to discharge both duties. I watch you and\r\nothers pretty closely, pretty constantly, nearer and oftener than you or they\r\nthink. Do you see that window with a light in it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe pointed to a lattice in one of the college boarding-houses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d said he, \u201cis a room I have hired, nominally for a study\u2014virtually for a\r\npost of observation. There I sit and read for hours together: it is my way\u2014my\r\ntaste. My book is this garden; its contents are human nature\u2014female human\r\nnature. I know you all by heart. Ah! I know you well\u2014St. Pierre, the\r\nParisienne\u2014cette ma\u00eetresse-femme, my cousin Beck herself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not right, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComment? it is not right? By whose creed? Does some dogma of Calvin or Luther\r\ncondemn it? What is that to me? I am no Protestant. My rich father (for, though\r\nI have known poverty, and once starved for a year in a garret in Rome\u2014starved\r\nwretchedly, often on a meal a day, and sometimes not that\u2014yet I was born to\r\nwealth)\u2014my rich father was a good Catholic; and he gave me a priest and a\r\nJesuit for a tutor. I retain his lessons; and to what discoveries, grand Dieu!\r\nhave they not aided me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDiscoveries made by stealth seem to me dishonourable discoveries.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPuritaine! I doubt it not. Yet see how my Jesuit\u2019s system works. You know the\r\nSt. Pierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPartially.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe laughed. \u201cYou say right\u2014\u2018partially\u2019; whereas I know her\r\nthoroughly; there is the difference. She played before me the amiable;\r\noffered me patte de velours; caressed, flattered, fawned on me. Now, I am\r\naccessible to a woman\u2019s flattery\u2014accessible against my reason. Though never\r\npretty, she was\u2014when I first knew her\u2014young, or knew how to look young. Like\r\nall her countrywomen, she had the art of dressing\u2014she had a certain cool, easy,\r\nsocial assurance, which spared me the pain of embarrassment\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, that must have been unnecessary. I never saw you embarrassed in my\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, you know little of me; I can be embarrassed as a petite\r\npensionnaire; there is a fund of modesty and diffidence in my nature\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I never saw it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, it is there. You ought to have seen it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I have observed you in public\u2014on platforms, in tribunes, before\r\ntitles and crowned heads\u2014and you were as easy as you are in the third\r\ndivision.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, neither titles nor crowned heads excite my modesty; and\r\npublicity is very much my element. I like it well, and breathe in it quite\r\nfreely;\u2014but\u2014but, in short, here is the sentiment brought into action, at this\r\nvery moment; however, I disdain to be worsted by it. If, Mademoiselle, I were a\r\nmarrying man (which I am not; and you may spare yourself the trouble of any\r\nsneer you may be contemplating at the thought), and found it necessary to ask a\r\nlady whether she could look upon me in the light of a future husband, then\r\nwould it be proved that I am as I say\u2014modest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI quite believed him now; and, in believing, I honoured him with a sincerity of\r\nesteem which made my heart ache.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs to the St. Pierre,\u201d he went on, recovering himself, for his voice had\r\naltered a little, \u201cshe once intended to be Madame Emanuel; and I don\u2019t know\r\nwhither I might have been led, but for yonder little lattice with the light.\r\nAh, magic lattice! what miracles of discovery hast thou wrought! Yes,\u201d he\r\npursued, \u201cI have seen her rancours, her vanities, her levities\u2014not only here,\r\nbut elsewhere: I have witnessed what bucklers me against all her arts: I am\r\nsafe from poor Z\u00e9lie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd my pupils,\u201d he presently recommenced, \u201cthose blondes jeunes filles\u2014so mild\r\nand meek\u2014I have seen the most reserved\u2014romp like boys, the demurest\u2014snatch\r\ngrapes from the walls, shake pears from the trees. When the English teacher\r\ncame, I saw her, marked her early preference for this alley, noticed her taste\r\nfor seclusion, watched her well, long before she and I came to speaking terms;\r\ndo you recollect my once coming silently and offering you a little knot of\r\nwhite violets when we were strangers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI recollect it. I dried the violets, kept them, and have them still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt pleased me when you took them peacefully and promptly, without prudery\u2014that\r\nsentiment which I ever dread to excite, and which, when it is revealed in eye\r\nor gesture, I vindictively detest. To return. Not only did I watch you;\r\nbut often\u2014especially at eventide\u2014another guardian angel was noiselessly\r\nhovering near: night after night my cousin Beck has stolen down yonder steps,\r\nand glidingly pursued your movements when you did not see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Monsieur, you could not from the distance of that window see what passed\r\nin this garden at night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy moonlight I possibly might with a glass\u2014I use a glass\u2014but the garden itself\r\nis open to me. In the shed, at the bottom, there is a door leading into a\r\ncourt, which communicates with the college; of that door I possess the key, and\r\nthus come and go at pleasure. This afternoon I came through it, and found you\r\nasleep in classe; again this evening I have availed myself of the same\r\nentrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help saying, \u201cIf you were a wicked, designing man, how terrible\r\nwould all this be!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis attention seemed incapable of being arrested by this view of the subject:\r\nhe lit his cigar, and while he puffed it, leaning against a tree, and looking\r\nat me in a cool, amused way he had when his humour was tranquil, I thought\r\nproper to go on sermonizing him: he often lectured me by the hour together\u2014I\r\ndid not see why I should not speak my mind for once. So I told him my\r\nimpressions concerning his Jesuit-system.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe knowledge it brings you is bought too dear, Monsieur; this coming and\r\ngoing by stealth degrades your own dignity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dignity!\u201d he cried, laughing; \u201cwhen did you ever see me trouble my head\r\nabout my dignity? It is you, Miss Lucy, who are \u2018digne.\u2019 How often, in your\r\nhigh insular presence, have I taken a pleasure in trampling upon, what you are\r\npleased to call, my dignity; tearing it, scattering it to the winds, in those\r\nmad transports you witness with such hauteur, and which I know you think very\r\nlike the ravings of a third-rate London actor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I tell you every glance you cast from that lattice is a wrong done\r\nto the best part of your own nature. To study the human heart thus, is to\r\nbanquet secretly and sacrilegiously on Eve\u2019s apples. I wish you were a\r\nProtestant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIndifferent to the wish, he smoked on. After a space of smiling yet thoughtful\r\nsilence, he said, rather suddenly\u2014\u201cI have seen other things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat other things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTaking the weed from his lips, he threw the remnant amongst the shrubs, where,\r\nfor a moment, it lay glowing in the gloom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook, at it,\u201d said he: \u201cis not that spark like an eye watching you and me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took a turn down the walk; presently returning, he went on:\u2014\u201cI have seen,\r\nMiss Lucy, things to me unaccountable, that have made me watch all night for a\r\nsolution, and I have not yet found it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe tone was peculiar; my veins thrilled; he saw me shiver.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you afraid? Whether is it of my words or that red jealous eye just winking\r\nitself out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am cold; the night grows dark and late, and the air is changed; it is time\r\nto go in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is little past eight, but you shall go in soon. Answer me only this\r\nquestion.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYet he paused ere he put it. The garden was truly growing dark; dusk had come\r\non with clouds, and drops of rain began to patter through the trees. I hoped he\r\nwould feel this, but, for the moment, he seemed too much absorbed to be\r\nsensible of the change.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, do you Protestants believe in the supernatural?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a difference of theory and belief on this point amongst Protestants\r\nas amongst other sects,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy, Monsieur, do you ask such a\r\nquestion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you shrink and speak so faintly? Are you superstitious?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am constitutionally nervous. I dislike the discussion of such subjects. I\r\ndislike it the more because\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou believe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: but it has happened to me to experience impressions\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSince you came here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; not many months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u2014in this house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! I am glad of it. I knew it, somehow; before you told me. I was conscious\r\nof rapport between you and myself. You are patient, and I am choleric; you are\r\nquiet and pale, and I am tanned and fiery; you are a strict Protestant, and I\r\nam a sort of lay Jesuit: but we are alike\u2014there is affinity between us. Do you\r\nsee it, Mademoiselle, when you look in the glass? Do you observe that your\r\nforehead is shaped like mine\u2014that your eyes are cut like mine? Do you hear that\r\nyou have some of my tones of voice? Do you know that you have many of my looks?\r\nI perceive all this, and believe that you were born under my star. Yes, you\r\nwere born under my star! Tremble! for where that is the case with mortals, the\r\nthreads of their destinies are difficult to disentangle; knottings and\r\ncatchings occur\u2014sudden breaks leave damage in the web. But these \u2018impressions,\u2019\r\nas you say, with English caution. I, too, have had my \u2018impressions.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, tell me them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI desire no better, and intend no less. You know the legend of this house and\r\ngarden?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know it. Yes. They say that hundreds of years ago a nun was buried here\r\nalive at the foot of this very tree, beneath the ground which now bears us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd that in former days a nun\u2019s ghost used to come and go here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, what if it comes and goes here still?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSomething comes and goes here: there is a shape frequenting this house by\r\nnight, different to any forms that show themselves by day. I have indisputably\r\nseen a something, more than once; and to me its conventual weeds were a strange\r\nsight, saying more than they can do to any other living being. A nun!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I, too, have seen it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI anticipated that. Whether this nun be flesh and blood, or something that\r\nremains when blood is dried, and flesh is wasted, her business is as much with\r\nyou as with me, probably. Well, I mean to make it out; it has baffled me so\r\nfar, but I mean to follow up the mystery. I mean\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInstead of telling what he meant, he raised his head suddenly; I made the same\r\nmovement in the same instant; we both looked to one point\u2014the high tree\r\nshadowing the great berceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the\r\nfirst classe. There had been a strange and inexplicable sound from that\r\nquarter, as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their own motion, and its\r\nweight of foliage had rushed and crushed against the massive trunk. Yes; there\r\nscarce stirred a breeze, and that heavy tree was convulsed, whilst the feathery\r\nshrubs stood still. For some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and\r\nheaving went on. Dark as it was, it seemed to me that something more solid than\r\neither night-shadow, or branch-shadow, blackened out of the boles. At last the\r\nstruggle ceased. What birth succeeded this travail? What Dryad was born of\r\nthese throes? We watched fixedly. A sudden bell rang in the house\u2014the\r\nprayer-bell. Instantly into our alley there came, out of the berceau, an\r\napparition, all black and white. With a sort of angry rush-close, close past\r\nour faces\u2014swept swiftly the very NUN herself! Never had I seen her so clearly.\r\nShe looked tall of stature, and fierce of gesture. As she went, the wind rose\r\nsobbing; the rain poured wild and cold; the whole night seemed to feel her.\r\n\n"}
{"33": "\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nTHE FIRST LETTER.\n\r\nWhere, it becomes time to inquire, was Paulina Mary? How fared my intercourse\r\nwith the sumptuous H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy? That intercourse had, for an interval, been\r\nsuspended by absence; M. and Miss de Bassompierre had been travelling, dividing\r\nsome weeks between the provinces and capital of France. Chance apprised me of\r\ntheir return very shortly after it took place.\r\n\n\r\nI was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard, wandering slowly on,\r\nenjoying the benign April sun, and some thoughts not unpleasing, when I saw\r\nbefore me a group of riders, stopping as if they had just encountered, and\r\nexchanging greetings in the midst of the broad, smooth, linden-bordered path;\r\non one side a middle-aged gentleman and young lady, on the other\u2014a young and\r\nhandsome man. Very graceful was the lady\u2019s mien, choice her appointments,\r\ndelicate and stately her whole aspect. Still, as I looked, I felt they were\r\nknown to me, and, drawing a little nearer, I fully recognised them all: the\r\nCount Home de Bassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton.\r\n\n\r\nHow animated was Graham\u2019s face! How true, how warm, yet how retiring the joy it\r\nexpressed! This was the state of things, this the combination of circumstances,\r\nat once to attract and enchain, to subdue and excite Dr. John. The pearl he\r\nadmired was in itself of great price and truest purity, but he was not the man\r\nwho, in appreciating the gem, could forget its setting. Had he seen Paulina\r\nwith the same youth, beauty, and grace, but on foot, alone, unguarded, and in\r\nsimple attire, a dependent worker, a demi-grisette, he would have thought her a\r\npretty little creature, and would have loved with his eye her movements and her\r\nmien, but it required other than this to conquer him as he was now vanquished,\r\nto bring him safe under dominion as now, without loss, and even with gain to\r\nhis manly honour, one saw that he was reduced; there was about Dr. John all the\r\nman of the world; to satisfy himself did not suffice; society must approve\u2014the\r\nworld must admire what he did, or he counted his measures false and futile. In\r\nhis victrix he required all that was here visible\u2014the imprint of high\r\ncultivation, the consecration of a careful and authoritative protection, the\r\nadjuncts that Fashion decrees, Wealth purchases, and Taste adjusts; for these\r\nconditions his spirit stipulated ere it surrendered: they were here to the\r\nutmost fulfilled; and now, proud, impassioned, yet fearing, he did homage to\r\nPaulina as his sovereign. As for her, the smile of feeling, rather than of\r\nconscious power, slept soft in her eyes.\r\n\n\r\nThey parted. He passed me at speed, hardly feeling the earth he skimmed, and\r\nseeing nothing on either hand. He looked very handsome; mettle and purpose were\r\nroused in him fully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, there is Lucy!\u201d cried a musical, friendly voice. \u201cLucy, dear\r\nLucy\u2014do come here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hastened to her. She threw back her veil, and stooped from her saddle to kiss\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was coming to see you to-morrow,\u201d said she; \u201cbut now to-morrow you will come\r\nand see me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe named the hour, and I promised compliance.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow\u2019s evening found me with her\u2014she and I shut into her own room. I had\r\nnot seen her since that occasion when her claims were brought into comparison\r\nwith those of Ginevra Fanshawe, and had so signally prevailed; she had much to\r\ntell me of her travels in the interval. A most animated, rapid speaker was she\r\nin such a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, a most lively describer; yet with her artless diction\r\nand clear soft voice, she never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much. My\r\nown attention I think would not soon have flagged, but by-and-by, she herself\r\nseemed to need some change of subject; she hastened to wind up her narrative\r\nbriefly. Yet why she terminated with so concise an abridgment did not\r\nimmediately appear; silence followed\u2014a restless silence, not without symptoms\r\nof abstraction. Then, turning to me, in a diffident, half-appealing\r\nvoice\u2014\u201cLucy\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I am at your side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs my cousin Ginevra still at Madame Beck\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour cousin is still there; you must be longing to see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou want to invite her to spend another evening?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I suppose she still talks about being married?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot to any one you care for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut of course she still thinks of Dr. Bretton? She cannot have changed her\r\nmind on that point, because it was so fixed two months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you know, it does not matter. You saw the terms on which they stood.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little misunderstanding that evening, certainly; does she seem\r\nunhappy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot she. To change the subject. Have you heard or seen nothing of, or from,\r\nGraham during your absence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa had letters from him once or twice about business, I think. He undertook\r\nthe management of some affair which required attention while we were away. Dr.\r\nBretton seems to respect papa, and to have pleasure in obliging him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: you met him yesterday on the boulevard; you would be able to judge from\r\nhis aspect that his friends need not be painfully anxious about his health?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa seems to have thought with you. I could not help smiling. He is not\r\nparticularly observant, you know, because he is often thinking of other things\r\nthan what pass before his eyes; but he said, as Dr. Bretton rode away, \u2018Really\r\nit does a man good to see the spirit and energy of that boy.\u2019 He called Dr.\r\nBretton a boy; I believe he almost thinks him so, just as he thinks me a little\r\ngirl; he was not speaking to me, but dropped that remark to himself. Lucy\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain fell the appealing accent, and at the same instant she left her chair,\r\nand came and sat on the stool at my feet.\r\n\n\r\nI liked her. It is not a declaration I have often made concerning my\r\nacquaintance, in the course of this book: the reader will bear with it for\r\nonce. Intimate intercourse, close inspection, disclosed in Paulina only what\r\nwas delicate, intelligent, and sincere; therefore my regard for her lay deep.\r\nAn admiration more superficial might have been more demonstrative; mine,\r\nhowever, was quiet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to ask of Lucy?\u201d said I; \u201cbe brave, and speak out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut there was no courage in her eye; as it met mine, it fell; and there was no\r\ncoolness on her cheek\u2014not a transient surface-blush, but a gathering inward\r\nexcitement raised its tint and its temperature.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I do wish to know your thoughts of Dr. Bretton. Do, do\r\ngive me your real opinion of his character, his disposition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis character stands high, and deservedly high.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd his disposition? Tell me about his disposition,\u201d she urged; \u201cyou know him\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know him pretty well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know his home-side. You have seen him with his mother; speak of him as a\r\nson.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is a fine-hearted son; his mother\u2019s comfort and hope, her pride and\r\npleasure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe held my hand between hers, and at each favourable word gave it a little\r\ncaressing stroke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn what other way is he good, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton is benevolent\u2014humanely disposed towards all his race, Dr. Bretton\r\nwould have benignity for the lowest savage, or the worst criminal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI heard some gentlemen, some of papa\u2019s friends, who were talking about him,\r\nsay the same. They say many of the poor patients at the hospitals, who tremble\r\nbefore some pitiless and selfish surgeons, welcome him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are right; I have witnessed as much. He once took me over a hospital; I\r\nsaw how he was received: your father\u2019s friends are right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe softest gratitude animated her eye as she lifted it a moment. She had yet\r\nmore to say, but seemed hesitating about time and place. Dusk was beginning to\r\nreign; her parlour fire already glowed with twilight ruddiness; but I thought\r\nshe wished the room dimmer, the hour later.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow quiet and secluded we feel here!\u201d I remarked, to reassure her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo we? Yes; it is a still evening, and I shall not be called down to tea; papa\r\nis dining out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill holding my hand, she played with the fingers unconsciously, dressed them,\r\nnow in her own rings, and now circled them with a twine of her beautiful hair;\r\nshe patted the palm against her hot cheek, and at last, having cleared a voice\r\nthat was naturally liquid as a lark\u2019s, she said:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must think it rather strange that I should talk so much about Dr. Bretton,\r\nask so many questions, take such an interest, but\u2014\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all strange; perfectly natural; you like him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I did,\u201d said she, with slight quickness, \u201cis that a reason why I should\r\ntalk? I suppose you think me weak, like my cousin Ginevra?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I thought you one whit like Madame Ginevra, I would not sit here waiting\r\nfor your communications. I would get up, walk at my ease about the room, and\r\nanticipate all you had to say by a round lecture. Go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean to go on,\u201d retorted she; \u201cwhat else do you suppose I mean to do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she looked and spoke\u2014the little Polly of Bretton\u2014petulant, sensitive.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf,\u201d said she, emphatically, \u201cif I liked Dr. John till I was fit to die for\r\nliking him, that alone could not license me to be otherwise than dumb\u2014dumb as\r\nthe grave\u2014dumb as you, Lucy Snowe\u2014you know it\u2014and you know you would despise me\r\nif I failed in self-control, and whined about some rickety liking that was all\r\non my side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is true I little respect women or girls who are loquacious either in\r\nboasting the triumphs, or bemoaning the mortifications, of feelings. But as to\r\nyou, Paulina, speak, for I earnestly wish to hear you. Tell me all it will give\r\nyou pleasure or relief to tell: I ask no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you care for me, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do, Paulina.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I love you. I had an odd content in being with you even when I was a\r\nlittle, troublesome, disobedient girl; it was charming to me then to lavish on\r\nyou my naughtiness and whims. Now you are acceptable to me, and I like to talk\r\nwith and trust you. So listen, Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she settled herself, resting against my arm\u2014resting gently, not with honest\r\nMistress Fanshawe\u2019s fatiguing and selfish weight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA few minutes since you asked whether we had not heard from Graham during our\r\nabsence, and I said there were two letters for papa on business; this was true,\r\nbut I did not tell you all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou evaded?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shuffled and equivocated, you know. However, I am going to speak the truth\r\nnow; it is getting darker; one can talk at one\u2019s ease. Papa often lets me open\r\nthe letter-bag and give him out the contents. One morning, about three weeks\r\nago, you don\u2019t know how surprised I was to find, amongst a dozen letters for M.\r\nde Bassompierre, a note addressed to Miss de Bassompierre. I spied it at once,\r\namidst all the rest; the handwriting was not strange; it attracted me directly.\r\nI was going to say, \u2018Papa, here is another letter from Dr. Bretton;\u2019 but the\r\n\u2018Miss\u2019 struck me mute. I actually never received a letter from a gentleman\r\nbefore. Ought I to have shown it to papa, and let him open it and read it\r\nfirst? I could not for my life, Lucy. I know so well papa\u2019s ideas about me: he\r\nforgets my age; he thinks I am a mere school-girl; he is not aware that other\r\npeople see I am grown up as tall as I shall be; so, with a curious mixture of\r\nfeelings, some of them self-reproachful, and some so fluttering and strong, I\r\ncannot describe them, I gave papa his twelve letters\u2014his herd of\r\npossessions\u2014and kept back my one, my ewe-lamb. It lay in my lap during\r\nbreakfast, looking up at me with an inexplicable meaning, making me feel myself\r\na thing double-existent\u2014a child to that dear papa, but no more a child to\r\nmyself. After breakfast I carried my letter up-stairs, and having secured\r\nmyself by turning the key in the door, I began to study the outside of my\r\ntreasure: it was some minutes before I could get over the direction and\r\npenetrate the seal; one does not take a strong place of this kind by instant\r\nstorm\u2014one sits down awhile before it, as beleaguers say. Graham\u2019s hand is like\r\nhimself, Lucy, and so is his seal\u2014all clear, firm, and rounded\u2014no slovenly\r\nsplash of wax\u2014a full, solid, steady drop\u2014a distinct impress; no pointed turns\r\nharshly pricking the optic nerve, but a clean, mellow, pleasant manuscript,\r\nthat soothes you as you read. It is like his face\u2014just like the chiselling of\r\nhis features: do you know his autograph?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have seen it: go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe seal was too beautiful to be broken, so I cut it round with my scissors.\r\nOn the point of reading the letter at last, I once more drew back voluntarily;\r\nit was too soon yet to drink that draught\u2014the sparkle in the cup was so\r\nbeautiful\u2014I would watch it yet a minute. Then I remembered all at once that I\r\nhad not said my prayers that morning. Having heard papa go down to breakfast a\r\nlittle earlier than usual, I had been afraid of keeping him waiting, and had\r\nhastened to join him as soon as dressed, thinking no harm to put off prayers\r\ntill afterwards. Some people would say I ought to have served God first and\r\nthen man; but I don\u2019t think heaven could be jealous of anything I might do for\r\npapa. I believe I am superstitious. A voice seemed now to say that another\r\nfeeling than filial affection was in question\u2014to urge me to pray before I dared\r\nto read what I so longed to read\u2014to deny myself yet a moment, and remember\r\nfirst a great duty. I have had these impulses ever since I can remember. I put\r\nthe letter down and said my prayers, adding, at the end, a strong entreaty that\r\nwhatever happened, I might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow, and\r\nmight never, in caring for others, neglect him. The very thought of such a\r\npossibility, so pierced my heart that it made me cry. But still, Lucy, I felt\r\nthat in time papa would have to be taught the truth, managed, and induced to\r\nhear reason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read the letter. Lucy, life is said to be all disappointment. I was\r\nnot disappointed. Ere I read, and while I read, my heart did more than throb\u2014it\r\ntrembled fast\u2014every quiver seemed like the pant of an animal athirst, laid down\r\nat a well and drinking; and the well proved quite full, gloriously clear; it\r\nrose up munificently of its own impulse; I saw the sun through its gush, and\r\nnot a mote, Lucy, no moss, no insect, no atom in the thrice-refined golden\r\ngurgle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLife,\u201d she went on, \u201cis said to be full of pain to some. I have read\r\nbiographies where the wayfarer seemed to journey on from suffering to\r\nsuffering; where Hope flew before him fast, never alighting so near, or\r\nlingering so long, as to give his hand a chance of one realizing grasp. I have\r\nread of those who sowed in tears, and whose harvest, so far from being reaped\r\nin joy, perished by untimely blight, or was borne off by sudden whirlwind; and,\r\nalas! some of these met the winter with empty garners, and died of utter want\r\nin the darkest and coldest of the year.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it their fault, Paulina, that they of whom you speak thus died?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always their fault. Some of them were good endeavouring people. I am not\r\nendeavouring, nor actively good, yet God has caused me to grow in sun, due\r\nmoisture, and safe protection, sheltered, fostered, taught, by my dear father;\r\nand now\u2014now\u2014another comes. Graham loves me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor some minutes we both paused on this climax.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes your father know?\u201d I inquired, in a low voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham spoke with deep respect of papa, but implied that he dared not approach\r\nthat quarter as yet; he must first prove his worth: he added that he must have\r\nsome light respecting myself and my own feelings ere he ventured to risk a step\r\nin the matter elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did you reply?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI replied briefly, but I did not repulse him. Yet I almost trembled for fear\r\nof making the answer too cordial: Graham\u2019s tastes are so fastidious. I wrote it\r\nthree times\u2014chastening and subduing the phrases at every rescript; at last,\r\nhaving confected it till it seemed to me to resemble a morsel of ice flavoured\r\nwith ever so slight a zest of fruit or sugar, I ventured to seal and despatch\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcellent, Paulina! Your instinct is fine; you understand Dr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how must I manage about papa? There I am still in pain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not manage at all. Wait now. Only maintain no further correspondence till\r\nyour father knows all, and gives his sanction.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he ever give it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTime will show. Wait.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton wrote one other letter, deeply grateful for my calm, brief note;\r\nbut I anticipated your advice, by saying, that while my sentiments continued\r\nthe same, I could not, without my father\u2019s knowledge, write again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou acted as you ought to have done; so Dr. Bretton will feel: it will\r\nincrease his pride in you, his love for you, if either be capable of increase.\r\nPaulina, that gentle hoar-frost of yours, surrounding so much pure, fine flame,\r\nis a priceless privilege of nature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see I feel Graham\u2019s disposition,\u201d said she. \u201cI feel that no delicacy can\r\nbe too exquisite for his treatment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is perfectly proved that you comprehend him, and then\u2014whatever Dr.\r\nBretton\u2019s disposition, were he one who expected to be more nearly met\u2014you would\r\nstill act truthfully, openly, tenderly, with your father.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I trust I shall thus act always. Oh, it will be pain to wake papa from\r\nhis dream, and tell him I am no more a little girl!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe in no hurry to do so, Paulina. Leave the revelation to Time and your kind\r\nFate. I also have noticed the gentleness of her cares for you: doubt not she\r\nwill benignantly order the circumstances, and fitly appoint the hour. Yes: I\r\nhave thought over your life just as you have yourself thought it over; I have\r\nmade comparisons like those to which you adverted. We know not the future, but\r\nthe past has been propitious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs a child I feared for you; nothing that has life was ever more susceptible\r\nthan your nature in infancy: under harshness or neglect, neither your outward\r\nnor your inward self would have ripened to what they now are. Much pain, much\r\nfear, much struggle, would have troubled the very lines of your features,\r\nbroken their regularity, would have harassed your nerves into the fever of\r\nhabitual irritation; you would have lost in health and cheerfulness, in grace\r\nand sweetness. Providence has protected and cultured you, not only for your own\r\nsake, but I believe for Graham\u2019s. His star, too, was fortunate: to develop\r\nfully the best of his nature, a companion like you was needed: there you are,\r\nready. You must be united. I knew it the first day I saw you together at La\r\nTerrasse. In all that mutually concerns you and Graham there seems to me\r\npromise, plan, harmony. I do not think the sunny youth of either will prove the\r\nforerunner of stormy age. I think it is deemed good that you two should live in\r\npeace and be happy\u2014not as angels, but as few are happy amongst mortals. Some\r\nlives are thus blessed: it is God\u2019s will: it is the attesting trace and\r\nlingering evidence of Eden. Other lives run from the first another course.\r\nOther travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty, wild and variable\u2014breast\r\nadverse winds, are belated and overtaken by the early closing winter night.\r\nNeither can this happen without the sanction of God; and I know that, amidst\r\nHis boundless works, is somewhere stored the secret of this last fate\u2019s\r\njustice: I know that His treasures contain the proof as the promise of its\r\nmercy.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"34": "\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nM. PAUL KEEPS HIS PROMISE.\n\r\nOn the first of May, we had all\u2014i.e. the twenty boarders and the four\r\nteachers\u2014notice to rise at five o\u2019clock of the morning, to be dressed and ready\r\nby six, to put ourselves under the command of M. le Professeur Emanuel, who was\r\nto head our march forth from Villette, for it was on this day he proposed to\r\nfulfil his promise of taking us to breakfast in the country. I, indeed, as the\r\nreader may perhaps remember, had not had the honour of an invitation when this\r\nexcursion was first projected\u2014rather the contrary; but on my now making\r\nallusion to this fact, and wishing to know how it was to be, my ear received a\r\npull, of which I did not venture to challenge the repetition by raising,\r\nfurther difficulties.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vous conseille de vous faire prier,\u201d said M. Emanuel, imperially menacing\r\nthe other ear. One Napoleonic compliment, however, was enough, so I made up my\r\nmind to be of the party.\r\n\n\r\nThe morning broke calm as summer, with singing of birds in the garden, and a\r\nlight dew-mist that promised heat. We all said it would be warm, and we all\r\nfelt pleasure in folding away heavy garments, and in assuming the attire\r\nsuiting a sunny season. The clean fresh print dress, and the light straw\r\nbonnet, each made and trimmed as the French workwoman alone can make and trim,\r\nso as to unite the utterly unpretending with the perfectly becoming, was the\r\nrule of costume. Nobody flaunted in faded silk; nobody wore a second-hand best\r\narticle.\r\n\n\r\nAt six the bell rang merrily, and we poured down the staircase, through the\r\ncarr\u00e9, along the corridor, into the vestibule. There stood our Professor,\r\nwearing, not his savage-looking palet\u00f4t and severe bonnet-grec, but a\r\nyoung-looking belted blouse and cheerful straw hat. He had for us all the\r\nkindest good-morrow, and most of us for him had a thanksgiving smile. We were\r\nmarshalled in order and soon started.\r\n\n\r\nThe streets were yet quiet, and the boulevards were fresh and peaceful as\r\nfields. I believe we were very happy as we walked along. This chief of ours had\r\nthe secret of giving a certain impetus to happiness when he would; just as, in\r\nan opposite mood, he could give a thrill to fear.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not lead nor follow us, but walked along the line, giving a word to\r\nevery one, talking much to his favourites, and not wholly neglecting even those\r\nhe disliked. It was rather my wish, for a reason I had, to keep slightly aloof\r\nfrom notice, and being paired with Ginevra Fanshawe, bearing on my arm the dear\r\npressure of that angel\u2019s not unsubstantial limb\u2014(she continued in excellent\r\ncase, and I can assure the reader it was no trifling business to bear the\r\nburden of her loveliness; many a time in the course of that warm day I wished\r\nto goodness there had been less of the charming commodity)\u2014however, having her,\r\nas I said, I tried to make her useful by interposing her always between myself\r\nand M. Paul, shifting my place, according as I heard him coming up to the right\r\nhand or the left. My private motive for this man\u0153uvre might be traced to the\r\ncircumstance of the new print dress I wore, being pink in colour\u2014a fact which,\r\nunder our present convoy, made me feel something as I have felt, when, clad in\r\na shawl with a red border, necessitated to traverse a meadow where pastured a\r\nbull.\r\n\n\r\nFor awhile, the shifting system, together with some modifications in the\r\narrangement of a black silk scarf, answered my purpose; but, by-and-by, he\r\nfound out, that whether he came to this side or to that, Miss Fanshawe was\r\nstill his neighbour. The course of acquaintance between Ginevra and him had\r\nnever run so smooth that his temper did not undergo a certain crisping process\r\nwhenever he heard her English accent: nothing in their dispositions fitted;\r\nthey jarred if they came in contact; he held her empty and affected; she deemed\r\nhim bearish, meddling, repellent.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, when he had changed his place for about the sixth time, finding still\r\nthe same untoward result to the experiment\u2014he thrust his head forward, settled\r\nhis eyes on mine, and demanded with impatience, \u201cQu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est? Vous me\r\njouez des tours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, however, ere, with his customary\r\nquickness, he seized the root of this proceeding: in vain I shook out the long\r\nfringe, and spread forth the broad end of my scarf. \u201cA-h-h! c\u2019est la robe\r\nrose!\u201d broke from his lips, affecting me very much like the sudden and irate\r\nlow of some lord of the meadow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is only cotton,\u201d I alleged, hurriedly; \u201cand cheaper, and washes better than\r\nany other colour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt Mademoiselle Lucy est coquette comme dix Parisiennes,\u201d he answered. \u201cA-t-on\r\njamais vu une Anglaise pareille. Regardez plut\u00f4t son chapeau, et ses gants, et\r\nses brodequins!\u201d These articles of dress were just like what my companions\r\nwore; certainly not one whit smarter\u2014perhaps rather plainer than most\u2014but\r\nMonsieur had now got hold of his text, and I began to chafe under the expected\r\nsermon. It went off, however, as mildly as the menace of a storm sometimes\r\npasses on a summer day. I got but one flash of sheet lightning in the shape of\r\na single bantering smile from his eyes; and then he said, \u201cCourage!\u2014\u00e0 vrai dire\r\nje ne suis pas f\u00e2ch\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame suis je content qu\u2019on s\u2019est fait si belle\r\npour ma petite f\u00eate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais ma robe n\u2019est pas belle, Monsieur\u2014elle n\u2019est que propre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019aime la propret\u00e9,\u201d said he. In short, he was not to be dissatisfied; the sun\r\nof good humour was to triumph on this auspicious morning; it consumed scudding\r\nclouds ere they sullied its disk.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now we were in the country, amongst what they called \u201cles bois et les\r\npetits sentiers.\u201d These woods and lanes a month later would offer but a dusty\r\nand doubtful seclusion: now, however, in their May greenness and morning\r\nrepose, they looked very pleasant.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached a certain well, planted round, in the taste of Labassecour, with an\r\norderly circle of lime-trees: here a halt was called; on the green swell of\r\nground surrounding this well, we were ordered to be seated, Monsieur taking his\r\nplace in our midst, and suffering us to gather in a knot round him. Those who\r\nliked him more than they feared, came close, and these were chiefly little\r\nones; those who feared more than they liked, kept somewhat aloof; those in whom\r\nmuch affection had given, even to what remained of fear, a pleasurable zest,\r\nobserved the greatest distance.\r\n\n\r\nHe began to tell us a story. Well could he narrate: in such a diction as\r\nchildren love, and learned men emulate; a diction simple in its strength, and\r\nstrong in its simplicity. There were beautiful touches in that little tale;\r\nsweet glimpses of feeling and hues of description that, while I listened, sunk\r\ninto my mind, and since have never faded. He tinted a twilight scene\u2014I hold it\r\nin memory still\u2014such a picture I have never looked on from artist\u2019s pencil.\r\n\n\r\nI have said, that, for myself, I had no impromptu faculty; and perhaps that\r\nvery deficiency made me marvel the more at one who possessed it in perfection.\r\nM. Emanuel was not a man to write books; but I have heard him lavish, with\r\ncareless, unconscious prodigality, such mental wealth as books seldom boast;\r\nhis mind was indeed my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I entered\r\nbliss. Intellectually imperfect as I was, I could read little; there were few\r\nbound and printed volumes that did not weary me\u2014whose perusal did not fag and\r\nblind\u2014but his tomes of thought were collyrium to the spirit\u2019s eyes; over their\r\ncontents, inward sight grew clear and strong. I used to think what a delight it\r\nwould be for one who loved him better than he loved himself, to gather and\r\nstore up those handfuls of gold-dust, so recklessly flung to heaven\u2019s reckless\r\nwinds.\r\n\n\r\nHis story done, he approached the little knoll where I and Ginevra sat apart.\r\nIn his usual mode of demanding an opinion (he had not reticence to wait till it\r\nwas voluntarily offered) he asked, \u201cWere you interested?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAccording to my wonted undemonstrative fashion, I simply answered\u2014\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet I could not write that down,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hate the mechanical labour; I hate to stoop and sit still. I could dictate\r\nit, though, with pleasure, to an amanuensis who suited me. Would Mademoiselle\r\nLucy write for me if I asked her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur would be too quick; he would urge me, and be angry if my pen did not\r\nkeep pace with his lips.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTry some day; let us see the monster I can make of myself under the\r\ncircumstances. But just now, there is no question of dictation; I mean to make\r\nyou useful in another office. Do you see yonder farm-house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurrounded with trees? Yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere we are to breakfast; and while the good fermi\u00e8re makes the caf\u00e9 au lait\r\nin a caldron, you and five others, whom I shall select, will spread with butter\r\nhalf a hundred rolls.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHaving formed his troop into line once more, he marched us straight on the\r\nfarm, which, on seeing our force, surrendered without capitulation.\r\n\n\r\nClean knives and plates, and fresh butter being provided, half-a-dozen of us,\r\nchosen by our Professor, set to work under his directions, to prepare for\r\nbreakfast a huge basket of rolls, with which the baker had been ordered to\r\nprovision the farm, in anticipation of our coming. Coffee and chocolate were\r\nalready made hot; cream and new-laid eggs were added to the treat, and M.\r\nEmanuel, always generous, would have given a large order for \u201cjambon\u201d and\r\n\u201cconfitures\u201d in addition, but that some of us, who presumed perhaps upon our\r\ninfluence, insisted that it would be a most reckless waste of victual. He\r\nrailed at us for our pains, terming us \u201cdes m\u00e9nag\u00e8res avares;\u201d but we let him\r\ntalk, and managed the economy of the repast our own way.\r\n\n\r\nWith what a pleasant countenance he stood on the farm-kitchen hearth looking\r\non! He was a man whom it made happy to see others happy; he liked to have\r\nmovement, animation, abundance and enjoyment round him. We asked where he would\r\nsit. He told us, we knew well he was our slave, and we his tyrants, and that he\r\ndared not so much as choose a chair without our leave; so we set him the\r\nfarmer\u2019s great chair at the head of the long table, and put him into it.\r\n\n\r\nWell might we like him, with all his passions and hurricanes, when he could be\r\nso benignant and docile at times, as he was just now. Indeed, at the worst, it\r\nwas only his nerves that were irritable, not his temper that was radically bad;\r\nsoothe, comprehend, comfort him, and he was a lamb; he would not harm a fly.\r\nOnly to the very stupid, perverse, or unsympathizing, was he in the slightest\r\ndegree dangerous.\r\n\n\r\nMindful always of his religion, he made the youngest of the party say a little\r\nprayer before we began breakfast, crossing himself as devotedly as a woman. I\r\nhad never seen him pray before, or make that pious sign; he did it so simply,\r\nwith such child-like faith, I could not help smiling pleasurably as I watched;\r\nhis eyes met my smile; he just stretched out his kind hand, saying, \u201cDonnez-moi\r\nla main! I see we worship the same God, in the same spirit, though by different\r\nrites.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMost of M. Emanuel\u2019s brother Professors were emancipated free-thinkers,\r\ninfidels, atheists; and many of them men whose lives would not bear scrutiny;\r\nhe was more like a knight of old, religious in his way, and of spotless fame.\r\nInnocent childhood, beautiful youth were safe at his side. He had vivid\r\npassions, keen feelings, but his pure honour and his artless piety were the\r\nstrong charm that kept the lions couchant.\r\n\n\r\nThat breakfast was a merry meal, and the merriment was not mere vacant clatter:\r\nM. Paul originated, led, controlled and heightened it; his social, lively\r\ntemper played unfettered and unclouded; surrounded only by women and children\r\nthere was nothing to cross and thwart him; he had his own way, and a pleasant\r\nway it was.\r\n\n\r\nThe meal over, the party were free to run and play in the meadows; a few stayed\r\nto help the farmer\u2019s wife to put away her earthenware. M. Paul called me from\r\namong these to come out and sit near him under a tree\u2014whence he could view the\r\ntroop gambolling, over a wide pasture\u2014and read to him whilst he took his cigar.\r\nHe sat on a rustic bench, and I at the tree-root. While I read (a\r\npocket-classic\u2014a Corneille\u2014I did not like it, but he did, finding therein\r\nbeauties I never could be brought to perceive), he listened with a sweetness of\r\ncalm the more impressive from the impetuosity of his general nature; the\r\ndeepest happiness filled his blue eye and smoothed his broad forehead. I, too,\r\nwas happy\u2014happy with the bright day, happier with his presence, happiest with\r\nhis kindness.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked, by-and-by, if I would not rather run to my companions than sit there?\r\nI said, no; I felt content to be where he was. He asked whether, if I were his\r\nsister, I should always be content to stay with a brother such as he. I said, I\r\nbelieved I should; and I felt it. Again, he inquired whether, if he were to\r\nleave Villette, and go far away, I should be sorry; and I dropped Corneille,\r\nand made no reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite s\u0153ur,\u201d said he; \u201chow long could you remember me if we were separated?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat, Monsieur, I can never tell, because I do not know how long it will be\r\nbefore I shall cease to remember everything earthly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to go beyond seas for two\u2014three\u2014five years, should you welcome me on\r\nmy return?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, how could I live in the interval?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPourtant j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pour vous bien dur, bien exigeant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hid my face with the book, for it was covered with tears. I asked him why he\r\ntalked so; and he said he would talk so no more, and cheered me again with the\r\nkindest encouragement. Still, the gentleness with which he treated me during\r\nthe rest of the day, went somehow to my heart. It was too tender. It was\r\nmournful. I would rather he had been abrupt, whimsical, and irate as was his\r\nwont.\r\n\n\r\nWhen hot noon arrived\u2014for the day turned out as we had anticipated, glowing as\r\nJune\u2014our shepherd collected his sheep from the pasture, and proceeded to lead\r\nus all softly home. But we had a whole league to walk, thus far from Villette\r\nwas the farm where he had breakfasted; the children, especially, were tired\r\nwith their play; the spirits of most flagged at the prospect of this mid-day\r\nwalk over chauss\u00e9es flinty, glaring, and dusty. This state of things had been\r\nforeseen and provided for. Just beyond the boundary of the farm we met two\r\nspacious vehicles coming to fetch us\u2014such conveyances as are hired out\r\npurposely for the accommodation of school-parties; here, with good management,\r\nroom was found for all, and in another hour M. Paul made safe consignment of\r\nhis charge at the Rue Fossette. It had been a pleasant day: it would have been\r\nperfect, but for the breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its sunshine a\r\nmoment.\r\n\n\r\nThat tarnish was renewed the same evening.\r\n\n\r\nJust about sunset, I saw M. Emanuel come out of the front-door, accompanied by\r\nMadame Beck. They paced the centre-alley for nearly an hour, talking earnestly:\r\nhe\u2014looking grave, yet restless; she\u2014wearing an amazed, expostulatory,\r\ndissuasive air.\r\n\n\r\nI wondered what was under discussion; and when Madame Beck re-entered the house\r\nas it darkened, leaving her kinsman Paul yet lingering in the garden, I said to\r\nmyself\u2014\u201cHe called me \u2018petite s\u0153ur\u2019 this morning. If he were really my brother,\r\nhow I should like to go to him just now, and ask what it is that presses on his\r\nmind. See how he leans against that tree, with his arms crossed and his brow\r\nbent. He wants consolation, I know: Madame does not console: she only\r\nremonstrates. What now\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStarting from quiescence to action, M. Paul came striding erect and quick down\r\nthe garden. The carr\u00e9 doors were yet open: I thought he was probably going to\r\nwater the orange-trees in the tubs, after his occasional custom; on reaching\r\nthe court, however, he took an abrupt turn and made for the berceau and the\r\nfirst-classe glass door. There, in that first classe I was, thence I had been\r\nwatching him; but there I could not find courage to await his approach. He had\r\nturned so suddenly, he strode so fast, he looked so strange; the coward within\r\nme grew pale, shrank and\u2014not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing the\r\nshrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his advance\u2014she was gone on the wings of\r\npanic.\r\n\n\r\nNor did I pause till I had taken sanctuary in the oratory, now empty. Listening\r\nthere with beating pulses, and an unaccountable, undefined apprehension, I\r\nheard him pass through all the schoolrooms, clashing the doors impatiently as\r\nhe went; I heard him invade the refectory which the \u201clecture pieuse\u201d was now\r\nholding under hallowed constraint; I heard him pronounce these words\u2014\u201cO\u00f9 est\r\nMademoiselle Lucie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd just as, summoning my courage, I was preparing to go down and do what,\r\nafter all, I most wished to do in the world\u2014viz., meet him\u2014the wiry voice of\r\nSt. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, \u201cElle est au lit.\u201d And he passed, with\r\nthe stamp of vexation, into the corridor. There Madame Beck met, captured,\r\nchid, convoyed to the street-door, and finally dismissed him.\r\n\n\r\nAs that street-door closed, a sudden amazement at my own perverse proceeding\r\nstruck like a blow upon me. I felt from the first it was me he wanted\u2014me he was\r\nseeking\u2014and had not I wanted him too? What, then, had carried me away? What had\r\nrapt me beyond his reach? He had something to tell: he was going to tell me\r\nthat something: my ear strained its nerve to hear it, and I had made the\r\nconfidence impossible. Yearning to listen and console, while I thought audience\r\nand solace beyond hope\u2019s reach\u2014no sooner did opportunity suddenly and fully\r\narrive, than I evaded it as I would have evaded the levelled shaft of\r\nmortality.\r\n\n\r\nWell, my insane inconsistency had its reward. Instead of the comfort, the\r\ncertain satisfaction, I might have won\u2014could I but have put choking panic down,\r\nand stood firm two minutes\u2014here was dead blank, dark doubt, and drear suspense.\r\n\n\r\nI took my wages to my pillow, and passed the night counting them.\r\n\n"}
{"35": "\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nMALEVOLA.\n\r\nMadame Beck called me on Thursday afternoon, and asked whether I had any\r\noccupation to hinder me from going into town and executing some little\r\ncommissions for her at the shops.\r\n\n\r\nBeing disengaged, and placing myself at her service, I was presently furnished\r\nwith a list of the wools, silks, embroidering thread, etcetera, wanted in the\r\npupils\u2019 work, and having equipped myself in a manner suiting the threatening\r\naspect of a cloudy and sultry day, I was just drawing the spring-bolt of the\r\nstreet-door, in act to issue forth, when Madame\u2019s voice again summoned me to\r\nthe salle-\u00e0-manger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon, Meess Lucie!\u201d cried she, in the seeming haste of an impromptu thought,\r\n\u201cI have just recollected one more errand for you, if your good-nature will not\r\ndeem itself over-burdened?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course I \u201cconfounded myself\u201d in asseverations to the contrary; and Madame,\r\nrunning into the little salon, brought thence a pretty basket, filled with fine\r\nhothouse fruit, rosy, perfect, and tempting, reposing amongst the dark green,\r\nwax-like leaves, and pale yellow stars of, I know not what, exotic plant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, \u201cit is not heavy, and will not shame your neat toilette, as\r\nif it were a household, servant-like detail. Do me the favour to leave this\r\nlittle basket at the house of Madame Walravens, with my felicitations on her\r\nf\u00eate. She lives down in the old town, Num\u00e9ro 3, Rue des Mages. I fear you will\r\nfind the walk rather long, but you have the whole afternoon before you, and do\r\nnot hurry; if you are not back in time for dinner, I will order a portion to be\r\nsaved, or Goton, with whom you are a favourite, will have pleasure in tossing\r\nup some trifle, for your especial benefit. You shall not be forgotten, ma bonne\r\nMeess. And oh! please!\u201d (calling me back once more) \u201cbe sure to insist on\r\nseeing Madame Walravens herself, and giving the basket into her own hands, in\r\norder that there may be no mistake, for she is rather a punctilious personage.\r\nAdieu! Au revoir!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd at last I got away. The shop commissions took some time to execute, that\r\nchoosing and matching of silks and wools being always a tedious business, but\r\nat last I got through my list. The patterns for the slippers, the bell-ropes,\r\nthe cabas were selected\u2014the slides and tassels for the purses chosen\u2014the whole\r\n\u201ctripotage,\u201d in short, was off my mind; nothing but the fruit and the\r\nfelicitations remained to be attended to.\r\n\n\r\nI rather liked the prospect of a long walk, deep into the old and grim\r\nBasse-Ville; and I liked it no worse because the evening sky, over the city,\r\nwas settling into a mass of black-blue metal, heated at the rim, and inflaming\r\nslowly to a heavy red.\r\n\n\r\nI fear a high wind, because storm demands that exertion of strength and use of\r\naction I always yield with pain; but the sullen down-fall, the thick\r\nsnow-descent, or dark rush of rain, ask only resignation\u2014the quiet abandonment\r\nof garments and person to be drenched. In return, it sweeps a great capital\r\nclean before you; it makes you a quiet path through broad, grand streets; it\r\npetrifies a living city as if by eastern enchantment; it transforms a Villette\r\ninto a Tadmor. Let, then, the rains fall, and the floods descend\u2014only I must\r\nfirst get rid of this basket of fruit.\r\n\n\r\nAn unknown clock from an unknown tower (Jean Baptiste\u2019s voice was now too\r\ndistant to be audible) was tolling the third quarter past five, when I reached\r\nthat street and house whereof Madame Beck had given me the address. It was no\r\nstreet at all; it seemed rather to be part of a square: it was quiet, grass\r\ngrew between the broad grey flags, the houses were large and looked very\r\nold\u2014behind them rose the appearance of trees, indicating gardens at the back.\r\nAntiquity brooded above this region, business was banished thence. Rich men had\r\nonce possessed this quarter, and once grandeur had made her seat here. That\r\nchurch, whose dark, half-ruinous turrets overlooked the square, was the\r\nvenerable and formerly opulent shrine of the Magi. But wealth and greatness had\r\nlong since stretched their gilded pinions and fled hence, leaving these their\r\nancient nests, perhaps to house Penury for a time, or perhaps to stand cold and\r\nempty, mouldering untenanted in the course of winters.\r\n\n\r\nAs I crossed this deserted \u201cplace,\u201d on whose pavement drops almost as large as\r\na five-franc piece were now slowly darkening, I saw, in its whole expanse, no\r\nsymptom or evidence of life, except what was given in the figure of an infirm\r\nold priest, who went past, bending and propped on a staff\u2014the type of eld and\r\ndecay.\r\n\n\r\nHe had issued from the very house to which I was directed; and when I paused\r\nbefore the door just closed after him, and rang the bell, he turned to look at\r\nme. Nor did he soon avert his gaze; perhaps he thought me, with my basket of\r\nsummer fruit, and my lack of the dignity age confers, an incongruous figure in\r\nsuch a scene. I know, had a young ruddy-faced bonne opened the door to admit\r\nme, I should have thought such a one little in harmony with her dwelling; but,\r\nwhen I found myself confronted by a very old woman, wearing a very antique\r\npeasant costume, a cap alike hideous and costly, with long flaps of native\r\nlace, a petticoat and jacket of cloth, and sabots more like little boats than\r\nshoes, it seemed all right, and soothingly in character.\r\n\n\r\nThe expression of her face was not quite so soothing as the cut of her costume;\r\nanything more cantankerous I have seldom seen; she would scarcely reply to my\r\ninquiry after Madame Walravens; I believe she would have snatched the basket of\r\nfruit from my hand, had not the old priest, hobbling up, checked her, and\r\nhimself lent an ear to the message with which I was charged.\r\n\n\r\nHis apparent deafness rendered it a little difficult to make him fully\r\nunderstand that I must see Madame Walravens, and consign the fruit into her own\r\nhands. At last, however, he comprehended the fact that such were my orders, and\r\nthat duty enjoined their literal fulfilment. Addressing the aged bonne, not in\r\nFrench, but in the aboriginal tongue of Labassecour, he persuaded her, at last,\r\nto let me cross the inhospitable threshold, and himself escorting me up-stairs,\r\nI was ushered into a sort of salon, and there left.\r\n\n\r\nThe room was large, and had a fine old ceiling, and almost church-like windows\r\nof coloured-glass; but it was desolate, and in the shadow of a coming storm,\r\nlooked strangely lowering. Within\u2014opened a smaller room; there, however, the\r\nblind of the single casement was closed; through the deep gloom few details of\r\nfurniture were apparent. These few I amused myself by puzzling to make out;\r\nand, in particular, I was attracted by the outline of a picture on the wall.\r\n\n\r\nBy-and-by the picture seemed to give way: to my bewilderment, it shook, it\r\nsunk, it rolled back into nothing; its vanishing left an opening arched,\r\nleading into an arched passage, with a mystic winding stair; both passage and\r\nstair were of cold stone, uncarpeted and unpainted. Down this donjon stair\r\ndescended a tap, tap, like a stick; soon there fell on the steps a shadow, and\r\nlast of all, I was aware of a substance.\r\n\n\r\nYet, was it actual substance, this appearance approaching me? this obstruction,\r\npartially darkening the arch?\r\n\n\r\nIt drew near, and I saw it well. I began to comprehend where I was. Well might\r\nthis old square be named quarter of the Magi\u2014well might the three towers,\r\noverlooking it, own for godfathers three mystic sages of a dead and dark art.\r\nHoar enchantment here prevailed; a spell had opened for me elf-land\u2014that\r\ncell-like room, that vanishing picture, that arch and passage, and stair of\r\nstone, were all parts of a fairy tale. Distincter even than these scenic\r\ndetails stood the chief figure\u2014Cunegonde, the sorceress! Malevola, the evil\r\nfairy. How was she?\r\n\n\r\nShe might be three feet high, but she had no shape; her skinny hands rested\r\nupon each other, and pressed the gold knob of a wand-like ivory staff. Her face\r\nwas large, set, not upon her shoulders, but before her breast; she seemed to\r\nhave no neck; I should have said there were a hundred years in her features,\r\nand more perhaps in her eyes\u2014her malign, unfriendly eyes, with thick grey brows\r\nabove, and livid lids all round. How severely they viewed me, with a sort of\r\ndull displeasure!\r\n\n\r\nThis being wore a gown of brocade, dyed bright blue, full-tinted as the\r\ngentianella flower, and covered with satin foliage in a large pattern; over the\r\ngown a costly shawl, gorgeously bordered, and so large for her, that its\r\nmany-coloured fringe swept the floor. But her chief points were her jewels: she\r\nhad long, clear earrings, blazing with a lustre which could not be borrowed or\r\nfalse; she had rings on her skeleton hands, with thick gold hoops, and\r\nstones\u2014purple, green, and blood-red. Hunchbacked, dwarfish, and doting, she was\r\nadorned like a barbarian queen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue me voulez-vous?\u201d said she, hoarsely, with the voice rather of male than of\r\nfemale old age; and, indeed, a silver beard bristled her chin.\r\n\n\r\nI delivered my basket and my message.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is all,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTruly, it was well worth while,\u201d she answered. \u201cReturn to Madame Beck, and\r\ntell her I can buy fruit when I want it, et quant \u00e0 ses f\u00e9licitations, je m\u2019en\r\nmoque!\u201d And this courteous dame turned her back.\r\n\n\r\nJust as she turned, a peal of thunder broke, and a flash of lightning blazed\r\nbroad over salon and boudoir. The tale of magic seemed to proceed with due\r\naccompaniment of the elements. The wanderer, decoyed into the enchanted castle,\r\nheard rising, outside, the spell-wakened tempest.\r\n\n\r\nWhat, in all this, was I to think of Madame Beck? She owned strange\r\nacquaintance; she offered messages and gifts at an unique shrine, and\r\ninauspicious seemed the bearing of the uncouth thing she worshipped. There went\r\nthat sullen Sidonia, tottering and trembling like palsy incarnate, tapping her\r\nivory staff on the mosaic parquet, and muttering venomously as she vanished.\r\n\n\r\nDown washed the rain, deep lowered the welkin; the clouds, ruddy a while ago,\r\nhad now, through all their blackness, turned deadly pale, as if in terror.\r\nNotwithstanding my late boast about not fearing a shower, I hardly liked to go\r\nout under this waterspout. Then the gleams of lightning were very fierce, the\r\nthunder crashed very near; this storm had gathered immediately above Villette;\r\nit seemed to have burst at the zenith; it rushed down prone; the forked, slant\r\nbolts pierced athwart vertical torrents; red zigzags interlaced a descent\r\nblanched as white metal: and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen\r\nabundance.\r\n\n\r\nLeaving Madame Walravens\u2019 inhospitable salon, I betook myself to her cold\r\nstaircase; there was a seat on the landing\u2014there I waited. Somebody came\r\ngliding along the gallery just above; it was the old priest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed Mademoiselle shall not sit there,\u201d said he. \u201cIt would displeasure our\r\nbenefactor if he knew a stranger was so treated in this house.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he begged me so earnestly to return to the salon, that, without\r\ndiscourtesy, I could not but comply. The smaller room was better furnished and\r\nmore habitable than the larger; thither he introduced me. Partially withdrawing\r\nthe blind, he disclosed what seemed more like an oratory than a boudoir, a very\r\nsolemn little chamber, looking as if it were a place rather dedicated to relics\r\nand remembrance, than designed for present use and comfort.\r\n\n\r\nThe good father sat down, as if to keep me company; but instead of conversing,\r\nhe took out a book, fastened on the page his eyes, and employed his lips in\r\nwhispering\u2014what sounded like a prayer or litany. A yellow electric light from\r\nthe sky gilded his bald head; his figure remained in shade\u2014deep and purple; he\r\nsat still as sculpture; he seemed to forget me for his prayers; he only looked\r\nup when a fiercer bolt, or a harsher, closer rattle told of nearing danger;\r\neven then, it was not in fear, but in seeming awe, he raised his eyes. I too\r\nwas awe-struck; being, however, under no pressure of slavish terror, my\r\nthoughts and observations were free.\r\n\n\r\nTo speak truth, I was beginning to fancy that the old priest resembled that\r\nP\u00e8re Silas, before whom I had kneeled in the church of the B\u00e9guinage. The idea\r\nwas vague, for I had seen my confessor only in dusk and in profile, yet still I\r\nseemed to trace a likeness: I thought also I recognized the voice. While I\r\nwatched him, he betrayed, by one lifted look, that he felt my scrutiny; I\r\nturned to note the room; that too had its half mystic interest.\r\n\n\r\nBeside a cross of curiously carved old ivory, yellow with time, and sloped\r\nabove a dark-red prie-dieu, furnished duly, with rich missal and ebon\r\nrosary\u2014hung the picture whose dim outline had drawn my eyes before\u2014the picture\r\nwhich moved, fell away with the wall and let in phantoms. Imperfectly seen, I\r\nhad taken it for a Madonna; revealed by clearer light, it proved to be a\r\nwoman\u2019s portrait in a nun\u2019s dress. The face, though not beautiful, was\r\npleasing; pale, young, and shaded with the dejection of grief or ill health. I\r\nsay again it was not beautiful; it was not even intellectual; its very\r\namiability was the amiability of a weak frame, inactive passions, acquiescent\r\nhabits: yet I looked long at that picture, and could not choose but look.\r\n\n\r\nThe old priest, who at first had seemed to me so deaf and infirm, must yet have\r\nretained his faculties in tolerable preservation; absorbed in his book as he\r\nappeared, without once lifting his head, or, as far as I knew, turning his\r\neyes, he perceived the point towards which my attention was drawn, and, in a\r\nslow distinct voice, dropped, concerning it, these four observations:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was much beloved.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe gave herself to God.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe died young.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is still remembered, still wept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy that aged lady, Madame Walravens?\u201d I inquired, fancying that I had\r\ndiscovered in the incurable grief of bereavement, a key to that same aged\r\nlady\u2019s desperate ill-humour.\r\n\n\r\nThe father shook his head with half a smile.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said he; \u201ca grand-dame\u2019s affection for her children\u2019s children may be\r\ngreat, and her sorrow for their loss, lively; but it is only the affianced\r\nlover, to whom Fate, Faith, and Death have trebly denied the bliss of union,\r\nwho mourns what he has lost, as Justine Marie is still mourned.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought the father rather wished to be questioned, and therefore I inquired\r\nwho had lost and who still mourned \u201cJustine Marie.\u201d I got, in reply, quite a\r\nlittle romantic narrative, told not unimpressively, with the accompaniment of\r\nthe now subsiding storm. I am bound to say it might have been made much more\r\ntruly impressive, if there had been less French, Rousseau-like sentimentalizing\r\nand wire-drawing; and rather more healthful carelessness of effect. But the\r\nworthy father was obviously a Frenchman born and bred (I became more and more\r\npersuaded of his resemblance to my confessor)\u2014he was a true son of Rome; when\r\nhe did lift his eyes, he looked at me out of their corners, with more and\r\nsharper subtlety than, one would have thought, could survive the wear and tear\r\nof seventy years. Yet, I believe, he was a good old man.\r\n\n\r\nThe hero of his tale was some former pupil of his, whom he now called his\r\nbenefactor, and who, it appears, had loved this pale Justine Marie, the\r\ndaughter of rich parents, at a time when his own worldly prospects were such as\r\nto justify his aspiring to a well-dowered hand. The pupil\u2019s father\u2014once a rich\r\nbanker\u2014had failed, died, and left behind him only debts and destitution. The\r\nson was then forbidden to think of Marie; especially that old witch of a\r\ngrand-dame I had seen, Madame Walravens, opposed the match with all the\r\nviolence of a temper which deformity made sometimes demoniac. The mild Marie\r\nhad neither the treachery to be false, nor the force to be quite staunch to her\r\nlover; she gave up her first suitor, but, refusing to accept a second with a\r\nheavier purse, withdrew to a convent, and there died in her noviciate.\r\n\n\r\nLasting anguish, it seems, had taken possession of the faithful heart which\r\nworshipped her, and the truth of that love and grief had been shown in a manner\r\nwhich touched even me, as I listened.\r\n\n\r\nSome years after Justine Marie\u2019s death, ruin had come on her house too: her\r\nfather, by nominal calling a jeweller, but who also dealt a good deal on the\r\nBourse, had been concerned in some financial transactions which entailed\r\nexposure and ruinous fines. He died of grief for the loss, and shame for the\r\ninfamy. His old hunchbacked mother and his bereaved wife were left penniless,\r\nand might have died too of want; but their lost daughter\u2019s once-despised, yet\r\nmost true-hearted suitor, hearing of the condition of these ladies, came with\r\nsingular devotedness to the rescue. He took on their insolent pride the revenge\r\nof the purest charity\u2014housing, caring for, befriending them, so as no son could\r\nhave done it more tenderly and efficiently. The mother\u2014on the whole a good\r\nwoman\u2014died blessing him; the strange, godless, loveless, misanthrope\r\ngrandmother lived still, entirely supported by this self-sacrificing man. Her,\r\nwho had been the bane of his life, blighting his hope, and awarding him, for\r\nlove and domestic happiness, long mourning and cheerless solitude, he treated\r\nwith the respect a good son might offer a kind mother. He had brought her to\r\nthis house, \u201cand,\u201d continued the priest, while genuine tears rose to his eyes,\r\n\u201chere, too, he shelters me, his old tutor, and Agnes, a superannuated servant\r\nof his father\u2019s family. To our sustenance, and to other charities, I know he\r\ndevotes three-parts of his income, keeping only the fourth to provide himself\r\nwith bread and the most modest accommodations. By this arrangement he has\r\nrendered it impossible to himself ever to marry: he has given himself to God\r\nand to his angel-bride as much as if he were a priest, like me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe father had wiped away his tears before he uttered these last words, and in\r\npronouncing them, he for one instant raised his eyes to mine. I caught this\r\nglance, despite its veiled character; the momentary gleam shot a meaning which\r\nstruck me.\r\n\n\r\nThese Romanists are strange beings. Such a one among them\u2014whom you know no more\r\nthan the last Inca of Peru, or the first Emperor of China\u2014knows you and all\r\nyour concerns; and has his reasons for saying to you so and so, when you simply\r\nthought the communication sprang impromptu from the instant\u2019s impulse: his plan\r\nin bringing it about that you shall come on such a day, to such a place, under\r\nsuch and such circumstances, when the whole arrangement seems to your crude\r\napprehension the ordinance of chance, or the sequel of exigency. Madame Beck\u2019s\r\nsuddenly-recollected message and present, my artless embassy to the Place of\r\nthe Magi, the old priest accidentally descending the steps and crossing the\r\nsquare, his interposition on my behalf with the bonne who would have sent me\r\naway, his reappearance on the staircase, my introduction to this room, the\r\nportrait, the narrative so affably volunteered\u2014all these little incidents,\r\ntaken as they fell out, seemed each independent of its successor; a handful of\r\nloose beads: but threaded through by that quick-shot and crafty glance of a\r\nJesuit-eye, they dropped pendent in a long string, like that rosary on the\r\nprie-dieu. Where lay the link of junction, where the little clasp of this\r\nmonastic necklace? I saw or felt union, but could not yet find the spot, or\r\ndetect the means of connection.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps the musing-fit into which I had by this time fallen, appeared somewhat\r\nsuspicious in its abstraction; he gently interrupted: \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cI trust you have not far to go through these inundated streets?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMore than half a league.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou live\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the Rue Fossette.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot\u201d (with animation), \u201cnot at the pensionnat of Madame Beck?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonc\u201d (clapping his hands), \u201cdonc, vous devez conna\u00eetre mon noble \u00e9l\u00e8ve, mon\r\nPaul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Paul Emanuel, Professor of Literature?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe and none other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA brief silence fell. The spring of junction seemed suddenly to have become\r\npalpable; I felt it yield to pressure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it of M. Paul you have been speaking?\u201d I presently inquired. \u201cWas he your\r\npupil and the benefactor of Madame Walravens?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, and of Agnes, the old servant: and moreover, (with a certain emphasis),\r\nhe was and is the lover, true, constant and eternal, of that saint in\r\nheaven\u2014Justine Marie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who, father, are you?\u201d I continued; and though I accentuated the\r\nquestion, its utterance was well nigh superfluous; I was ere this quite\r\nprepared for the answer which actually came.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI, daughter, am P\u00e8re Silas; that unworthy son of Holy Church whom you once\r\nhonoured with a noble and touching confidence, showing me the core of a heart,\r\nand the inner shrine of a mind whereof, in solemn truth, I coveted the\r\ndirection, in behalf of the only true faith. Nor have I for a day lost sight of\r\nyou, nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted interest. Passed under the\r\ndiscipline of Rome, moulded by her high training, inoculated with her salutary\r\ndoctrines, inspired by the zeal she alone gives\u2014I realize what then might be\r\nyour spiritual rank, your practical value; and I envy Heresy her prey.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis struck me as a special state of things\u2014I half-realized myself in that\r\ncondition also; passed under discipline, moulded, trained, inoculated, and so\r\non. \u201cNot so,\u201d thought I, but I restrained deprecation, and sat quietly enough.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose M. Paul does not live here?\u201d I resumed, pursuing a theme which I\r\nthought more to the purpose than any wild renegade dreams.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; he only comes occasionally to worship his beloved saint, to make his\r\nconfession to me, and to pay his respects to her he calls his mother. His own\r\nlodging consists but of two rooms: he has no servant, and yet he will not\r\nsuffer Madame Walravens to dispose of those splendid jewels with which you see\r\nher adorned, and in which she takes a puerile pride as the ornaments of her\r\nyouth, and the last relics of her son the jeweller\u2019s wealth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow often,\u201d murmured I to myself, \u201chas this man, this M. Emanuel, seemed to me\r\nto lack magnanimity in trifles, yet how great he is in great things!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI own I did not reckon amongst the proofs of his greatness, either the act of\r\nconfession, or the saint-worship.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long is it since that lady died?\u201d I inquired, looking at Justine Marie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwenty years. She was somewhat older than M. Emanuel; he was then very young,\r\nfor he is not much beyond forty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes he yet weep her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis heart will weep her always: the essence of Emanuel\u2019s nature is\u2014constancy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was said with marked emphasis.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now the sun broke out pallid and waterish; the rain yet fell, but there was\r\nno more tempest: that hot firmament had cloven and poured out its lightnings. A\r\nlonger delay would scarce leave daylight for my return, so I rose, thanked the\r\nfather for his hospitality and his tale, was benignantly answered by a \u201cpax\r\nvobiscum,\u201d which I made kindly welcome, because it seemed uttered with a true\r\nbenevolence; but I liked less the mystic phrase accompanying it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDaughter, you shall be what you shall be!\u201d an oracle that made\r\nme shrug my shoulders as soon as I had got outside the door. Few of us know\r\nwhat we are to come to certainly, but for all that had happened yet, I had good\r\nhopes of living and dying a sober-minded Protestant: there was a hollowness\r\nwithin, and a flourish around \u201cHoly Church\u201d which tempted me but moderately. I\r\nwent on my way pondering many things. Whatever Romanism may be, there are good\r\nRomanists: this man, Emanuel, seemed of the best; touched with superstition,\r\ninfluenced by priestcraft, yet wondrous for fond faith, for pious devotion, for\r\nsacrifice of self, for charity unbounded. It remained to see how Rome, by her\r\nagents, handled such qualities; whether she cherished them for their own sake\r\nand for God\u2019s, or put them out to usury and made booty of the interest.\r\n\n\r\nBy the time I reached home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly saved me a portion\r\nof dinner, which indeed I needed. She called me into the little cabinet to\r\npartake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance, bringing me a\r\nglass of wine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d began she, chuckling, \u201cand what sort of a reception did Madame\r\nWalravens give you? Elle est dr\u00f4le, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI told her what had passed, delivering verbatim the courteous message with\r\nwhich I had been charged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh la singuli\u00e8re petite bossue!\u201d laughed she. \u201cEt figurez-vous qu\u2019elle me\r\nd\u00e9teste, parcequ\u2019elle me croit amoureuse de mon cousin Paul; ce petit d\u00e9vot qui\r\nn\u2019ose pas bouger, \u00e0 moins que son confesseur ne lui donne la permission! Au\r\nreste\u201d (she went on), \u201cif he wanted to marry ever so much\u2014soit moi, soit une\r\nautre\u2014he could not do it; he has too large a family already on his hands: M\u00e8re\r\nWalravens, P\u00e8re Silas, Dame Agnes, and a whole troop of nameless paupers. There\r\nnever was a man like him for laying on himself burdens greater than he can\r\nbear, voluntarily incurring needless responsibilities. Besides, he harbours a\r\nromantic idea about some pale-faced Marie Justine\u2014personnage assez niaise \u00e0 ce\r\nque je pense\u201d (such was Madame\u2019s irreverent remark), \u201cwho has been an angel in\r\nheaven, or elsewhere, this score of years, and to whom he means to go, free\r\nfrom all earthly ties, pure comme un lis, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il dit. Oh, you would laugh\r\ncould you but know half M. Emanuel\u2019s crotchets and eccentricities! But I hinder\r\nyou from taking refreshment, ma bonne Meess, which you must need; eat your\r\nsupper, drink your wine, oubliez les anges, les bossues, et surtout, les\r\nProfesseurs\u2014et bon soir!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"36": "\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nFRATERNITY.\n\r\n\u201cOubliez les Professeurs.\u201d So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise woman,\r\nbut she should not have uttered those words. To do so was a mistake. That night\r\nshe should have left me calm\u2014not excited, indifferent, not interested, isolated\r\nin my own estimation and that of others\u2014not connected, even in idea, with this\r\nsecond person whom I was to forget.\r\n\n\r\nForget him? Ah! they took a sage plan to make me forget him\u2014the wiseheads! They\r\nshowed me how good he was; they made of my dear little man a stainless little\r\nhero. And then they had prated about his manner of loving. What means had I,\r\nbefore this day, of being certain whether he could love at all or not?\r\n\n\r\nI had known him jealous, suspicious; I had seen about him certain tendernesses,\r\nfitfulnesses\u2014a softness which came like a warm air, and a ruth which passed\r\nlike early dew, dried in the heat of his irritabilities: this was all I\r\nhad seen. And they, P\u00e8re Silas and Modeste Maria Beck (that these two wrought\r\nin concert I could not doubt) opened up the adytum of his heart\u2014showed me one\r\ngrand love, the child of this southern nature\u2019s youth, born so strong and\r\nperfect, that it had laughed at Death himself, despised his mean rape of\r\nmatter, clung to immortal spirit, and in victory and faith, had watched beside\r\na tomb twenty years.\r\n\n\r\nThis had been done\u2014not idly: this was not a mere hollow indulgence of\r\nsentiment; he had proven his fidelity by the consecration of his best energies\r\nto an unselfish purpose, and attested it by limitless personal sacrifices: for\r\nthose once dear to her he prized\u2014he had laid down vengeance, and taken up a\r\ncross.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as for Justine Marie, I knew what she was as well as if I had seen her. I\r\nknew she was well enough; there were girls like her in Madame Beck\u2019s\r\nschool\u2014phlegmatics\u2014pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil,\r\nundistinguished for good.\r\n\n\r\nIf she wore angels\u2019 wings, I knew whose poet-fancy conferred them. If her\r\nforehead shone luminous with the reflex of a halo, I knew in the fire of whose\r\nirids that circlet of holy flame had generation.\r\n\n\r\nWas I, then, to be frightened by Justine Marie? Was the picture of a pale dead\r\nnun to rise, an eternal barrier? And what of the charities which absorbed his\r\nworldly goods? What of his heart sworn to virginity?\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck\u2014P\u00e8re Silas\u2014you should not have suggested these questions. They were\r\nat once the deepest puzzle, the strongest obstruction, and the keenest\r\nstimulus, I had ever felt. For a week of nights and days I fell asleep\u2014I\r\ndreamt, and I woke upon these two questions. In the whole world there was no\r\nanswer to them, except where one dark little man stood, sat, walked, lectured,\r\nunder the head-piece of a bandit bonnet-grec, and within the girth of a sorry\r\npalet\u00f4t, much be-inked, and no little adust.\r\n\n\r\nAfter that visit to the Rue des Mages, I did want to see him again. I\r\nfelt as if\u2014knowing what I now knew\u2014his countenance would offer a page more\r\nlucid, more interesting than ever; I felt a longing to trace in it the imprint\r\nof that primitive devotedness, the signs of that half-knightly, half-saintly\r\nchivalry which the priest\u2019s narrative imputed to his nature. He had become my\r\nChristian hero: under that character I wanted to view him.\r\n\n\r\nNor was opportunity slow to favour; my new impressions underwent her test the\r\nnext day. Yes: I was granted an interview with my \u201cChristian hero\u201d\u2014an interview\r\nnot very heroic, or sentimental, or biblical, but lively enough in its way.\r\n\n\r\nAbout three o\u2019clock of the afternoon, the peace of the first classe\u2014safely\r\nestablished, as it seemed, under the serene sway of Madame Beck, who, in\r\npropria persona, was giving one of her orderly and useful lessons\u2014this\r\npeace, I say, suffered a sudden fracture by the wild inburst of a palet\u00f4t.\r\n\n\r\nNobody at the moment was quieter than myself. Eased of responsibility by Madame\r\nBeck\u2019s presence, soothed by her uniform tones, pleased and edified with her\r\nclear exposition of the subject in hand (for she taught well), I sat bent over\r\nmy desk, drawing\u2014that is, copying an elaborate line engraving, tediously\r\nworking up my copy to the finish of the original, for that was my practical\r\nnotion of art; and, strange to say, I took extreme pleasure in the labour, and\r\ncould even produce curiously finical Chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint\r\nplates\u2014things about as valuable as so many achievements in worsted-work, but I\r\nthought pretty well of them in those days.\r\n\n\r\nWhat was the matter? My drawing, my pencils, my precious copy, gathered into\r\none crushed-up handful, perished from before my sight; I myself appeared to be\r\nshaken or emptied out of my chair, as a solitary and withered nutmeg might be\r\nemptied out of a spice-box by an excited cook. That chair and my desk, seized\r\nby the wild palet\u00f4t, one under each sleeve, were borne afar; in a second, I\r\nfollowed the furniture; in two minutes they and I were fixed in the centre of\r\nthe grand salle\u2014a vast adjoining room, seldom used save for dancing and choral\r\nsinging-lessons\u2014fixed with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the remotest\r\nhope of our ever being permitted to stir thence again.\r\n\n\r\nHaving partially collected my scared wits, I found myself in the presence of\r\ntwo men, gentlemen, I suppose I should say\u2014one dark, the other light\u2014one having\r\na stiff, half-military air, and wearing a braided surtout; the other partaking,\r\nin garb and bearing, more of the careless aspect of the student or artist\r\nclass: both flourishing in full magnificence of moustaches, whiskers, and\r\nimperial. M. Emanuel stood a little apart from these; his countenance and eyes\r\nexpressed strong choler; he held forth his hand with his tribune gesture.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said he, \u201cyour business is to prove to these gentlemen that I\r\nam no liar. You will answer, to the best of your ability, such questions as\r\nthey shall put. You will also write on such theme as they shall select. In\r\ntheir eyes, it appears, I hold the position of an unprincipled impostor. I\r\nwrite essays; and, with deliberate forgery, sign to them my pupils\u2019 names, and\r\nboast of them as their work. You will disprove this charge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGrand ciel! Here was the show-trial, so long evaded, come on me like a\r\nthunder-clap. These two fine, braided, mustachioed, sneering personages, were\r\nnone other than dandy professors of the college\u2014Messieurs Boissec and\r\nRochemorte\u2014a pair of cold-blooded fops and pedants, sceptics, and scoffers. It\r\nseems that M. Paul had been rashly exhibiting something I had\r\nwritten\u2014something, he had never once praised, or even mentioned, in my hearing,\r\nand which I deemed forgotten. The essay was not remarkable at all; it only\r\nseemed remarkable, compared with the average productions of foreign\r\nschool-girls; in an English establishment it would have passed scarce noticed.\r\nMessieurs Boissec and Rochemorte had thought proper to question its\r\ngenuineness, and insinuate a cheat; I was now to bear my testimony to the\r\ntruth, and to be put to the torture of their examination.\r\n\n\r\nA memorable scene ensued.\r\n\n\r\nThey began with classics. A dead blank. They went on to French history. I\r\nhardly knew M\u00e9rov\u00e9e from Pharamond. They tried me in various \u2019ologies, and\r\nstill only got a shake of the head, and an unchanging \u201cJe n\u2019en sais rien.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAfter an expressive pause, they proceeded to matters of general information,\r\nbroaching one or two subjects which I knew pretty well, and on which I had\r\noften reflected. M. Emanuel, who had hitherto stood looking on, dark as the\r\nwinter-solstice, brightened up somewhat; he thought I should now show myself at\r\nleast no fool.\r\n\n\r\nHe learned his error. Though answers to the questions surged up fast, my mind\r\nfilling like a rising well, ideas were there, but not words. I either\r\ncould not, or would not speak\u2014I am not sure which: partly, I\r\nthink, my nerves had got wrong, and partly my humour was crossed.\r\n\n\r\nI heard one of my examiners\u2014he of the braided surtout\u2014whisper to his\r\nco-professor, \u201cEst-elle donc idiote?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I thought, \u201can idiot she is, and always will be, for such as you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I suffered\u2014suffered cruelly; I saw the damps gather on M. Paul\u2019s brow, and\r\nhis eye spoke a passionate yet sad reproach. He would not believe in my total\r\nlack of popular cleverness; he thought I could be prompt if I\r\nwould.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, to relieve him, the professors, and myself, I stammered out:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen, you had better let me go; you will get no good of me; as you say, I\r\nam an idiot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI wish I could have spoken with calm and dignity, or I wish my sense had\r\nsufficed to make me hold my tongue; that traitor tongue tripped, faltered.\r\nBeholding the judges cast on M. Emanuel a hard look of triumph, and hearing the\r\ndistressed tremor of my own voice, out I burst in a fit of choking tears. The\r\nemotion was far more of anger than grief; had I been a man and strong, I could\r\nhave challenged that pair on the spot\u2014but it was emotion, and I would\r\nrather have been scourged than betrayed it.\r\n\n\r\nThe incapables! Could they not see at once the crude hand of a novice in that\r\ncomposition they called a forgery? The subject was classical. When M. Paul\r\ndictated the trait on which the essay was to turn, I heard it for the first\r\ntime; the matter was new to me, and I had no material for its treatment. But I\r\ngot books, read up the facts, laboriously constructed a skeleton out of the dry\r\nbones of the real, and then clothed them, and tried to breathe into them life,\r\nand in this last aim I had pleasure. With me it was a difficult and anxious\r\ntime till my facts were found, selected, and properly jointed; nor could I rest\r\nfrom research and effort till I was satisfied of correct anatomy; the strength\r\nof my inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity sometimes enabled me to\r\nshun egregious blunders; but the knowledge was not there in my head, ready and\r\nmellow; it had not been sown in Spring, grown in Summer, harvested in Autumn,\r\nand garnered through Winter; whatever I wanted I must go out and gather fresh;\r\nglean of wild herbs my lapful, and shred them green into the pot. Messieurs\r\nBoissec and Rochemorte did not perceive this. They mistook my work for the work\r\nof a ripe scholar.\r\n\n\r\nThey would not yet let me go: I must sit down and write before them. As I\r\ndipped my pen in the ink with a shaking hand, and surveyed the white paper with\r\neyes half-blinded and overflowing, one of my judges began mincingly to\r\napologize for the pain he caused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNous agissons dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Nous ne voulons pas vous blesser,\u201d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\n\r\nScorn gave me nerve. I only answered,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDictate, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nRochemorte named this theme: \u201cHuman Justice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHuman Justice! What was I to make of it? Blank, cold abstraction, unsuggestive\r\nto me of one inspiring idea; and there stood M. Emanuel, sad as Saul, and stern\r\nas Joab, and there triumphed his accusers.\r\n\n\r\nAt these two I looked. I was gathering my courage to tell them that I would\r\nneither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction, that their theme\r\ndid not suit, nor their presence inspire me, and that, notwithstanding, whoever\r\nthrew the shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel\u2019s honour, outraged that truth of\r\nwhich they had announced themselves the\u2014champions: I meant to utter all\r\nthis, I say, when suddenly, a light darted on memory.\r\n\n\r\nThose two faces looking out of the forest of long hair, moustache, and\r\nwhisker\u2014those two cold yet bold, trustless yet presumptuous visages\u2014were the\r\nsame faces, the very same that, projected in full gaslight from behind the\r\npillars of a portico, had half frightened me to death on the night of my\r\ndesolate arrival in Villette. These, I felt morally certain, were the very\r\nheroes who had driven a friendless foreigner beyond her reckoning and her\r\nstrength, chased her breathless over a whole quarter of the town.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPious mentors!\u201d thought I. \u201cPure guides for youth! If \u2018Human Justice\u2019 were\r\nwhat she ought to be, you two would scarce hold your present post, or enjoy\r\nyour present credit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAn idea once seized, I fell to work. \u201cHuman Justice\u201d rushed before me in novel\r\nguise, a red, random beldame, with arms akimbo. I saw her in her house, the den\r\nof confusion: servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give;\r\nbeggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed; a swarm of children,\r\nsick and quarrelsome, crawled round her feet, and yelled in her ears appeals\r\nfor notice, sympathy, cure, redress. The honest woman cared for none of these\r\nthings. She had a warm seat of her own by the fire, she had her own solace in a\r\nshort black pipe, and a bottle of Mrs. Sweeny\u2019s soothing syrup; she smoked and\r\nshe sipped, and she enjoyed her paradise; and whenever a cry of the suffering\r\nsouls about her pierced her ears too keenly\u2014my jolly dame seized the poker or\r\nthe hearth-brush: if the offender was weak, wronged, and sickly, she\r\neffectually settled him: if he was strong, lively, and violent, she only\r\nmenaced, then plunged her hand in her deep pouch, and flung a liberal shower of\r\nsugar-plums.\r\n\n\r\nSuch was the sketch of \u201cHuman Justice,\u201d scratched hurriedly on paper, and\r\nplaced at the service of Messrs. Boissec and Rochemorte. M. Emanuel read it\r\nover my shoulder. Waiting no comment, I curtsied to the trio, and withdrew.\r\n\n\r\nAfter school that day, M. Paul and I again met. Of course the meeting did not\r\nat first run smooth; there was a crow to pluck with him; that forced\r\nexamination could not be immediately digested. A crabbed dialogue terminated in\r\nmy being called \u201cune petite moqueuse et sans-c\u0153ur,\u201d and in Monsieur\u2019s\r\ntemporary departure.\r\n\n\r\nNot wishing him to go quite away, only desiring he should feel that such a\r\ntransport as he had that day given way to, could not be indulged with perfect\r\nimpunity, I was not sorry to see him, soon after, gardening in the berceau. He\r\napproached the glass door; I drew near also. We spoke of some flowers growing\r\nround it. By-and-by Monsieur laid down his spade; by-and-by he recommenced\r\nconversation, passed to other subjects, and at last touched a point of\r\ninterest.\r\n\n\r\nConscious that his proceeding of that day was specially open to a charge of\r\nextravagance, M. Paul half apologized; he half regretted, too, the fitfulness\r\nof his moods at all times, yet he hinted that some allowance ought to be made\r\nfor him. \u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cI can hardly expect it at your hands, Miss Lucy; you\r\nknow neither me, nor my position, nor my history.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis history. I took up the word at once; I pursued the idea.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur,\u201d I rejoined. \u201cOf course, as you say, I know neither your\r\nhistory, nor your position, nor your sacrifices, nor any of your sorrows, or\r\ntrials, or affections, or fidelities. Oh, no! I know nothing about you; you are\r\nfor me altogether a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHein?\u201d he murmured, arching his brows in surprise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know, Monsieur, I only see you in classe\u2014stern, dogmatic, hasty,\r\nimperious. I only hear of you in town as active and wilful, quick to originate,\r\nhasty to lead, but slow to persuade, and hard to bend. A man like you, without\r\nties, can have no attachments; without dependants, no duties. All we, with whom\r\nyou come in contact, are machines, which you thrust here and there,\r\ninconsiderate of their feelings. You seek your recreations in public, by the\r\nlight of the evening chandelier: this school and yonder college are your\r\nworkshops, where you fabricate the ware called pupils. I don\u2019t so much as know\r\nwhere you live; it is natural to take it for granted that you have no home, and\r\nneed none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am judged,\u201d said he. \u201cYour opinion of me is just what I thought it was. For\r\nyou I am neither a man nor a Christian. You see me void of affection and\r\nreligion, unattached by friend or family, unpiloted by principle or faith. It\r\nis well, Mademoiselle; such is our reward in this life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are a philosopher, Monsieur; a cynic philosopher\u201d (and I looked at his\r\npalet\u00f4t, of which he straightway brushed the dim sleeve with his hand),\r\n\u201cdespising the foibles of humanity\u2014above its luxuries\u2014independent of its\r\ncomforts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt vous, Mademoiselle? vous \u00eates proprette et douillette, et affreusement\r\ninsensible, par-dessus le march\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, in short, Monsieur, now I think of it, you must live somewhere? Do\r\ntell me where; and what establishment of servants do you keep?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith a fearful projection of the under-lip, implying an impetus of scorn the\r\nmost decided, he broke out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vis dans un trou! I inhabit a den, Miss\u2014a cavern, where you would not put\r\nyour dainty nose. Once, with base shame of speaking the whole truth, I talked\r\nabout my \u2018study\u2019 in that college: know now that this \u2018study\u2019 is my whole abode;\r\nmy chamber is there and my drawing-room. As for my \u2018establishment of servants\u2019\u201d\r\n(mimicking my voice) \u201cthey number ten; les voil\u00e0.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he grimly spread, close under my eyes, his ten fingers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI black my boots,\u201d pursued he savagely. \u201cI brush my palet\u00f4t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur, it is too plain; you never do that,\u201d was my parenthesis.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe fais mon lit et mon m\u00e9nage; I seek my dinner in a restaurant; my supper\r\ntakes care, of itself; I pass days laborious and loveless; nights long and\r\nlonely; I am ferocious, and bearded and monkish; and nothing now living in this\r\nworld loves me, except some old hearts worn like my own, and some few beings,\r\nimpoverished, suffering, poor in purse and in spirit, whom the kingdoms of this\r\nworld own not, but to whom a will and testament not to be disputed has\r\nbequeathed the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, Monsieur; but I know!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know? many things, I verily believe; yet not me, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know that you have a pleasant old house in a pleasant old square of the\r\nBasse-Ville\u2014why don\u2019t you go and live there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHein?\u201d muttered he again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI liked it much, Monsieur; with the steps ascending to the door, the grey\r\nflags in front, the nodding trees behind\u2014real trees, not shrubs\u2014trees dark,\r\nhigh, and of old growth. And the boudoir-oratoire\u2014you should make that room\r\nyour study; it is so quiet and solemn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe eyed me closely; he half-smiled, half-coloured. \u201cWhere did you pick up all\r\nthat? Who told you?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNobody told me. Did I dream it, Monsieur, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I enter into your visions? Can I guess a woman\u2019s waking thoughts, much\r\nless her sleeping fantasies?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I dreamt it, I saw in my dream human beings as well as a house. I saw a\r\npriest, old, bent, and grey, and a domestic\u2014old, too, and picturesque; and a\r\nlady, splendid but strange; her head would scarce reach to my elbow\u2014her\r\nmagnificence might ransom a duke. She wore a gown bright as lapis-lazuli\u2014a\r\nshawl worth a thousand francs: she was decked with ornaments so brilliant, I\r\nnever saw any with such a beautiful sparkle; but her figure looked as if it had\r\nbeen broken in two and bent double; she seemed also to have outlived the common\r\nyears of humanity, and to have attained those which are only labour and sorrow.\r\nShe was become morose\u2014almost malevolent; yet somebody, it appears, cared\r\nfor her in her infirmities\u2014somebody forgave her trespasses, hoping to have his\r\ntrespasses forgiven. They lived together, these three people\u2014the mistress, the\r\nchaplain, the servant\u2014all old, all feeble, all sheltered under one kind wing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe covered with his hand the upper part of his face, but did not conceal his\r\nmouth, where I saw hovering an expression I liked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see you have entered into my secrets,\u201d said he, \u201cbut how was it done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I told him how\u2014the commission on which I had been sent, the storm which had\r\ndetained me, the abruptness of the lady, the kindness of the priest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs I sat waiting for the rain to cease, P\u00e8re Silas whiled away the time with a\r\nstory,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA story! What story? P\u00e8re Silas is no romancist.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell Monsieur the tale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: begin at the beginning. Let me hear some of Miss Lucy\u2019s French\u2014her best\r\nor her worst\u2014I don\u2019t much care which: let us have a good poign\u00e9e of barbarisms,\r\nand a bounteous dose of the insular accent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur is not going to be gratified by a tale of ambitious proportions, and\r\nthe spectacle of the narrator sticking fast in the midst. But I will tell him\r\nthe title\u2014the \u2018Priest\u2019s Pupil.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said he, the swarthy flush again dyeing his dark cheek. \u201cThe good old\r\nfather could not have chosen a worse subject; it is his weak point. But what of\r\nthe \u2018Priest\u2019s Pupil?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! many things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may as well define what things. I mean to know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere was the pupil\u2019s youth, the pupil\u2019s manhood;\u2014his avarice, his\r\ningratitude, his implacability, his inconstancy. Such a bad pupil, Monsieur!\u2014so\r\nthankless, cold-hearted, unchivalrous, unforgiving!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt puis?\u201d said he, taking a cigar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt puis,\u201d I pursued, \u201che underwent calamities which one did not pity\u2014bore them\r\nin a spirit one did not admire\u2014endured wrongs for which one felt no sympathy;\r\nfinally took the unchristian revenge of heaping coals of fire on his\r\nadversary\u2019s head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have not told me all,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNearly all, I think: I have indicated the heads of P\u00e8re Silas\u2019s chapters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have forgotten one\u2014that which touched on the pupil\u2019s lack of affection\u2014on\r\nhis hard, cold, monkish heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue; I remember now. P\u00e8re Silas did say that his vocation was almost\r\nthat of a priest\u2014that his life was considered consecrated.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy what bonds or duties?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy the ties of the past and the charities of the present.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have, then, the whole situation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have now told Monsieur all that was told me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSome meditative minutes passed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mademoiselle Lucy, look at me, and with that truth which I believe you\r\nnever knowingly violate, answer me one question. Raise your eyes; rest them on\r\nmine; have no hesitation; fear not to trust me\u2014I am a man to be trusted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI raised my eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKnowing me thoroughly now\u2014all my antecedents, all my responsibilities\u2014having\r\nlong known my faults, can you and I still be friends?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf Monsieur wants a friend in me, I shall be glad to have a friend in him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut a close friend I mean\u2014intimate and real\u2014kindred in all but blood. Will\r\nMiss Lucy be the sister of a very poor, fettered, burdened, encumbered man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not answer him in words, yet I suppose I did answer him; he took\r\nmy hand, which found comfort, in the shelter of his. His friendship was\r\nnot a doubtful, wavering benefit\u2014a cold, distant hope\u2014a sentiment so brittle as\r\nnot to bear the weight of a finger: I at once felt (or thought I felt)\r\nits support like that of some rock.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen I talk of friendship, I mean true friendship,\u201d he repeated\r\nemphatically; and I could hardly believe that words so earnest had blessed my\r\near; I hardly could credit the reality of that kind, anxious look he gave. If\r\nhe really wished for my confidence and regard, and really would\r\ngive me his\u2014why, it seemed to me that life could offer nothing more or better.\r\nIn that case, I was become strong and rich: in a moment I was made\r\nsubstantially happy. To ascertain the fact, to fix and seal it, I asked\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Monsieur quite serious? Does he really think he needs me, and can take an\r\ninterest in me as a sister?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely, surely,\u201d said he; \u201ca lonely man like me, who has no sister, must be\r\nbut too glad to find in some woman\u2019s heart a sister\u2019s pure affection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd dare I rely on Monsieur\u2019s regard? Dare I speak to him when I am so\r\ninclined?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little sister must make her own experiments,\u201d said he; \u201cI will give no\r\npromises. She must tease and try her wayward brother till she has drilled him\r\ninto what she wishes. After all, he is no inductile material in some hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile he spoke, the tone of his voice, the light of his now affectionate eye,\r\ngave me such a pleasure as, certainly, I had never felt. I envied no girl her\r\nlover, no bride her bridegroom, no wife her husband; I was content with this my\r\nvoluntary, self-offering friend. If he would but prove reliable, and he\r\nlooked reliable, what, beyond his friendship, could I ever covet? But,\r\nif all melted like a dream, as once before had happened\u2014?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQu\u2019est-ce donc? What is it?\u201d said he, as this thought threw its weight on my\r\nheart, its shadow on my countenance. I told him; and after a moment\u2019s pause,\r\nand a thoughtful smile, he showed me how an equal fear\u2014lest I should weary of\r\nhim, a man of moods so difficult and fitful\u2014had haunted his mind for more than\r\none day, or one month.\r\n\n\r\nOn hearing this, a quiet courage cheered me. I ventured a word of re-assurance.\r\nThat word was not only tolerated; its repetition was courted. I grew quite\r\nhappy\u2014strangely happy\u2014in making him secure, content, tranquil. Yesterday, I\r\ncould not have believed that earth held, or life afforded, moments like the few\r\nI was now passing. Countless times it had been my lot to watch apprehended\r\nsorrow close darkly in; but to see unhoped-for happiness take form, find place,\r\nand grow more real as the seconds sped, was indeed a new experience.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d said M. Paul, speaking low, and still holding my hand, \u201cdid you see a\r\npicture in the boudoir of the old house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did; a picture painted on a panel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe portrait of a nun?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou heard her history?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou remember what we saw that night in the berceau?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall never forget it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not connect the two ideas; that would be folly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the apparition when I saw the portrait,\u201d said I; which was true\r\nenough.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not, nor will you fancy,\u201d pursued he, \u201cthat a saint in heaven perturbs\r\nherself with rivalries of earth? Protestants are rarely superstitious; these\r\nmorbid fancies will not beset you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know not what to think of this matter; but I believe a perfectly natural\r\nsolution of this seeming mystery will one day be arrived at.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless, doubtless. Besides, no good-living woman\u2014much less a pure, happy\r\nspirit\u2014would trouble amity like ours\u2014n\u2019est-il pas vrai?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEre I could answer, Fifine Beck burst in, rosy and abrupt, calling out that I\r\nwas wanted. Her mother was going into town to call on some English family, who\r\nhad applied for a prospectus: my services were needed as interpreter. The\r\ninterruption was not unseasonable: sufficient for the day is always the evil;\r\nfor this hour, its good sufficed. Yet I should have liked to ask M. Paul\r\nwhether the \u201cmorbid fancies,\u201d against which he warned me, wrought in his own\r\nbrain.\r\n\n"}
{"37": "\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nTHE APPLE OF DISCORD.\n\r\nBesides Fifine Beck\u2019s mother, another power had a word to say to M. Paul and\r\nme, before that covenant of friendship could be ratified. We were under the\r\nsurveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son through that\r\nmystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to which M. Emanuel drew nigh\r\nmonth by month\u2014the sliding panel of the confessional.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?\u201d asks the reader. \u201cHad he not\r\nlong been a friend to you? Had he not given proof on proof of a certain\r\npartiality in his feelings?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYes, he had; but still I liked to hear him say so earnestly\u2014that he was my\r\nclose, true friend; I liked his modest doubts, his tender deference\u2014that trust\r\nwhich longed to rest, and was grateful when taught how. He had called me\r\n\u201csister.\u201d It was well. Yes; he might call me what he pleased, so long as he\r\nconfided in me. I was willing to be his sister, on condition that he did not\r\ninvite me to fill that relation to some future wife of his; and tacitly vowed\r\nas he was to celibacy, of this dilemma there seemed little danger.\r\n\n\r\nThrough most of the succeeding night I pondered that evening\u2019s interview. I\r\nwanted much the morning to break, and then listened for the bell to ring; and,\r\nafter rising and dressing, I deemed prayers and breakfast slow, and all the\r\nhours lingering, till that arrived at last which brought me the lesson of\r\nliterature. My wish was to get a more thorough comprehension of this fraternal\r\nalliance: to note with how much of the brother he would demean himself when we\r\nmet again; to prove how much of the sister was in my own feelings; to discover\r\nwhether I could summon a sister\u2019s courage, and he a brother\u2019s frankness.\r\n\n\r\nHe came. Life is so constructed, that the event does not, cannot, will not,\r\nmatch the expectation. That whole day he never accosted me. His lesson was\r\ngiven rather more quietly than usual, more mildly, and also more gravely. He\r\nwas fatherly to his pupils, but he was not brotherly to me. Ere he left the\r\nclasse, I expected a smile, if not a word; I got neither: to my portion fell\r\none nod\u2014hurried, shy.\r\n\n\r\nThis distance, I argued, is accidental\u2014it is involuntary; patience, and it will\r\nvanish. It vanished not; it continued for days; it increased. I suppressed my\r\nsurprise, and swallowed whatever other feelings began to surge.\r\n\n\r\nWell might I ask when he offered fraternity\u2014\u201cDare I rely on you?\u201d Well might\r\nhe, doubtless knowing himself, withhold all pledge. True, he had bid me make my\r\nown experiments\u2014tease and try him. Vain injunction! Privilege nominal and\r\nunavailable! Some women might use it! Nothing in my powers or instinct placed\r\nme amongst this brave band. Left alone, I was passive; repulsed, I withdrew;\r\nforgotten\u2014my lips would not utter, nor my eyes dart a reminder. It seemed there\r\nhad been an error somewhere in my calculations, and I wanted for time to\r\ndisclose it.\r\n\n\r\nBut the day came when, as usual, he was to give me a lesson. One evening in\r\nseven he had long generously bestowed on me, devoting it to the examination of\r\nwhat had been done in various studies during the past week, and to the\r\npreparation of work for the week in prospect. On these occasions my schoolroom\r\nwas anywhere, wherever the pupils and the other teachers happened to be, or in\r\ntheir close vicinage, very often in the large second division, where it was\r\neasy to choose a quiet nook when the crowding day pupils were absent, and the\r\nfew boarders gathered in a knot about the surveillante\u2019s estrade.\r\n\n\r\nOn the customary evening, hearing the customary hour strike, I collected my\r\nbooks and papers, my pen and ink, and sought the large division.\r\n\n\r\nIn classe there was no one, and it lay all in cool deep shadow; but through the\r\nopen double doors was seen the carr\u00e9, filled with pupils and with light; over\r\nhall and figures blushed the westering sun. It blushed so ruddily and vividly,\r\nthat the hues of the walls and the variegated tints of the dresses seemed all\r\nfused in one warm glow. The girls were seated, working or studying; in the\r\nmidst of their circle stood M. Emanuel, speaking good-humouredly to a teacher.\r\nHis dark palet\u00f4t, his jetty hair, were tinged with many a reflex of crimson;\r\nhis Spanish face, when he turned it momentarily, answered the sun\u2019s animated\r\nkiss with an animated smile. I took my place at a desk.\r\n\n\r\nThe orange-trees, and several plants, full and bright with bloom, basked also\r\nin the sun\u2019s laughing bounty; they had partaken it the whole day, and now asked\r\nwater. M. Emanuel had a taste for gardening; he liked to tend and foster\r\nplants. I used to think that working amongst shrubs with a spade or a\r\nwatering-pot soothed his nerves; it was a recreation to which he often had\r\nrecourse; and now he looked to the orange-trees, the geraniums, the gorgeous\r\ncactuses, and revived them all with the refreshment their drought needed. His\r\nlips meantime sustained his precious cigar, that (for him) first necessary and\r\nprime luxury of life; its blue wreaths curled prettily enough amongst the\r\nflowers, and in the evening light. He spoke no more to the pupils, nor to the\r\nmistresses, but gave many an endearing word to a small spanieless (if one may\r\ncoin a word), that nominally belonged to the house, but virtually owned him as\r\nmaster, being fonder of him than any inmate. A delicate, silky, loving, and\r\nlovable little doggie she was, trotting at his side, looking with expressive,\r\nattached eyes into his face; and whenever he dropped his bonnet-grec or his\r\nhandkerchief, which he occasionally did in play, crouching beside it with the\r\nair of a miniature lion guarding a kingdom\u2019s flag.\r\n\n\r\nThere were many plants, and as the amateur gardener fetched all the water from\r\nthe well in the court, with his own active hands, his work spun on to some\r\nlength. The great school-clock ticked on. Another hour struck. The carr\u00e9 and\r\nthe youthful group lost the illusion of sunset. Day was drooping. My lesson, I\r\nperceived, must to-night be very short; but the orange-trees, the cacti, the\r\ncamelias were all served now. Was it my turn?\r\n\n\r\nAlas! in the garden were more plants to be looked after,\u2014favourite rose-bushes,\r\ncertain choice flowers; little Sylvie\u2019s glad bark and whine followed the\r\nreceding palet\u00f4t down the alleys. I put up some of my books; I should not want\r\nthem all; I sat and thought; and waited, involuntarily deprecating the creeping\r\ninvasion of twilight.\r\n\n\r\nSylvie, gaily frisking, emerged into view once more, heralding the returning\r\npalet\u00f4t; the watering-pot was deposited beside the well; it had fulfilled its\r\noffice; how glad I was! Monsieur washed his hands in a little stone bowl. There\r\nwas no longer time for a lesson now; ere long the prayer-bell must ring; but\r\nstill we should meet; he would speak; a chance would be offered of reading in\r\nhis eyes the riddle of his shyness. His ablutions over, he stood, slowly\r\nre-arranging his cuffs, looking at the horn of a young moon, set pale in the\r\nopal sky, and glimmering faint on the oriel of Jean Baptiste. Sylvie watched\r\nthe mood contemplative; its stillness irked her; she whined and jumped to break\r\nit. He looked down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite exigeante,\u201d said he; \u201cyou must not be forgotten one moment, it seems.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped, lifted her in his arms, sauntered across the court, within a yard\r\nof the line of windows near one of which I sat: he sauntered lingeringly,\r\nfondling the spaniel in his bosom, calling her tender names in a tender voice.\r\nOn the front-door steps he turned; once again he looked at the moon, at the\r\ngrey cathedral, over the remoter spires and house-roofs fading into a blue sea\r\nof night-mist; he tasted the sweet breath of dusk, and noted the folded bloom\r\nof the garden; he suddenly looked round; a keen beam out of his eye rased the\r\nwhite fa\u00e7ade of the classes, swept the long line of crois\u00e9es. I think he bowed;\r\nif he did, I had no time to return the courtesy. In a moment he was gone; the\r\nmoonlit threshold lay pale and shadowless before the closed front door.\r\n\n\r\nGathering in my arms all that was spread on the desk before me, I carried back\r\nthe unused heap to its place in the third classe. The prayer-bell rang; I\r\nobeyed its summons.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow would not restore him to the Rue Fossette, that day being devoted\r\nentirely to his college. I got through my teaching; I got over the intermediate\r\nhours; I saw evening approaching, and armed myself for its heavy ennuis.\r\nWhether it was worse to stay with my co-inmates, or to sit alone, I had not\r\nconsidered; I naturally took up the latter alternative; if there was a hope of\r\ncomfort for any moment, the heart or head of no human being in this house could\r\nyield it; only under the lid of my desk could it harbour, nestling between the\r\nleaves of some book, gilding a pencil-point, the nib of a pen, or tinging the\r\nblack fluid in that ink-glass. With a heavy heart I opened my desk-lid; with a\r\nweary hand I turned up its contents.\r\n\n\r\nOne by one, well-accustomed books, volumes sewn in familiar covers, were taken\r\nout and put back hopeless: they had no charm; they could not comfort. Is this\r\nsomething new, this pamphlet in lilac? I had not seen it before, and I\r\nre-arranged my desk this very day\u2014this very afternoon; the tract must have been\r\nintroduced within the last hour, while we were at dinner.\r\n\n\r\nI opened it. What was it? What would it say to me?\r\n\n\r\nIt was neither tale nor poem, neither essay nor history; it neither sung, nor\r\nrelated, not discussed. It was a theological work; it preached and it\r\npersuaded.\r\n\n\r\nI lent to it my ear very willingly, for, small as it was, it possessed its own\r\nspell, and bound my attention at once. It preached Romanism; it persuaded to\r\nconversion. The voice of that sly little book was a honeyed voice; its accents\r\nwere all unction and balm. Here roared no utterance of Rome\u2019s thunders, no\r\nblasting of the breath of her displeasure. The Protestant was to turn Papist,\r\nnot so much in fear of the heretic\u2019s hell, as on account of the comfort, the\r\nindulgence, the tenderness Holy Church offered: far be it from her to threaten\r\nor to coerce; her wish was to guide and win. She persecute? Oh dear no!\r\nnot on any account!\r\n\n\r\nThis meek volume was not addressed to the hardened and worldly; it was not even\r\nstrong meat for the strong: it was milk for babes: the mild effluence of a\r\nmother\u2019s love towards her tenderest and her youngest; intended wholly and\r\nsolely for those whose head is to be reached through the heart. Its appeal was\r\nnot to intellect; it sought to win the affectionate through their affections,\r\nthe sympathizing through their sympathies: St. Vincent de Paul, gathering his\r\norphans about him, never spoke more sweetly.\r\n\n\r\nI remember one capital inducement to apostacy was held out in the fact that the\r\nCatholic who had lost dear friends by death could enjoy the unspeakable solace\r\nof praying them out of purgatory. The writer did not touch on the firmer peace\r\nof those whose belief dispenses with purgatory altogether: but I thought of\r\nthis; and, on the whole, preferred the latter doctrine as the most consolatory.\r\nThe little book amused, and did not painfully displease me. It was a canting,\r\nsentimental, shallow little book, yet something about it cheered my gloom and\r\nmade me smile; I was amused with the gambols of this unlicked wolf-cub muffled\r\nin the fleece, and mimicking the bleat of a guileless lamb. Portions of it\r\nreminded me of certain Wesleyan Methodist tracts I had once read when a child;\r\nthey were flavoured with about the same seasoning of excitation to fanaticism.\r\nHe that had written it was no bad man, and while perpetually betraying the\r\ntrained cunning\u2014the cloven hoof of his system\u2014I should pause before accusing\r\nhimself of insincerity. His judgment, however, wanted surgical props; it was\r\nrickety.\r\n\n\r\nI smiled then over this dose of maternal tenderness, coming from the ruddy old\r\nlady of the Seven Hills; smiled, too, at my own disinclination, not to say\r\ndisability, to meet these melting favours. Glancing at the title-page, I found\r\nthe name of \u201cP\u00e8re Silas.\u201d A fly-leaf bore in small, but clear and well-known\r\npencil characters: \u201cFrom P. C. D. E. to L\u2014y.\u201d And when I saw this I laughed:\r\nbut not in my former spirit. I was revived.\r\n\n\r\nA mortal bewilderment cleared suddenly from my head and vision; the solution of\r\nthe Sphinx-riddle was won; the conjunction of those two names, P\u00e8re Silas and\r\nPaul Emanuel, gave the key to all. The penitent had been with his director;\r\npermitted to withhold nothing; suffered to keep no corner of his heart sacred\r\nto God and to himself; the whole narrative of our late interview had been drawn\r\nfrom him; he had avowed the covenant of fraternity, and spoken of his adopted\r\nsister. How could such a covenant, such adoption, be sanctioned by the Church?\r\nFraternal communion with a heretic! I seemed to hear P\u00e8re Silas annulling the\r\nunholy pact; warning his penitent of its perils; entreating, enjoining reserve,\r\nnay, by the authority of his office, and in the name, and by the memory of all\r\nM. Emanuel held most dear and sacred, commanding the enforcement of that new\r\nsystem whose frost had pierced to the marrow of my bones.\r\n\n\r\nThese may not seem pleasant hypotheses; yet, by comparison, they were welcome.\r\nThe vision of a ghostly troubler hovering in the background, was as nothing,\r\nmatched with the fear of spontaneous change arising in M. Paul himself.\r\n\n\r\nAt this distance of time, I cannot be sure how far the above conjectures were\r\nself-suggested: or in what measure they owed their origin and confirmation to\r\nanother quarter. Help was not wanting.\r\n\n\r\nThis evening there was no bright sunset: west and east were one cloud; no\r\nsummer night-mist, blue, yet rose-tinged, softened the distance; a clammy fog\r\nfrom the marshes crept grey round Villette. To-night the watering-pot might\r\nrest in its niche by the well: a small rain had been drizzling all the\r\nafternoon, and still it fell fast and quietly. This was no weather for rambling\r\nin the wet alleys, under the dripping trees; and I started to hear Sylvie\u2019s\r\nsudden bark in the garden\u2014her bark of welcome. Surely she was not accompanied\r\nand yet this glad, quick bark was never uttered, save in homage to one\r\npresence.\r\n\n\r\nThrough the glass door and the arching berceau, I commanded the deep vista of\r\nthe all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue: thither rushed Sylvie, glistening through its gloom like a\r\nwhite guelder-rose. She ran to and fro, whining, springing, harassing little\r\nbirds amongst the bushes. I watched five minutes; no fulfilment followed the\r\nomen. I returned to my books; Sylvie\u2019s sharp bark suddenly ceased. Again I\r\nlooked up. She was standing not many yards distant, wagging her white feathery\r\ntail as fast as the muscle would work, and intently watching the operations of\r\na spade, plied fast by an indefatigable hand. There was M. Emanuel, bent over\r\nthe soil, digging in the wet mould amongst the rain-laden and streaming shrubs,\r\nworking as hard as if his day\u2019s pittance were yet to earn by the literal sweat\r\nof his brow.\r\n\n\r\nIn this sign I read a ruffled mood. He would dig thus in frozen snow on the\r\ncoldest winter day, when urged inwardly by painful emotion, whether of nervous\r\nexcitation, or, sad thoughts of self-reproach. He would dig by the hour, with\r\nknit brow and set teeth, nor once lift his head, or open his lips.\r\n\n\r\nSylvie watched till she was tired. Again scampering devious, bounding here,\r\nrushing there, snuffing and sniffing everywhere; she at last discovered me in\r\nclasse. Instantly she flew barking at the panes, as if to urge me forth to\r\nshare her pleasure or her master\u2019s toil; she had seen me occasionally walking\r\nin that alley with M. Paul; and I doubt not, considered it my duty to join him\r\nnow, wet as it was.\r\n\n\r\nShe made such a bustle that M. Paul at last looked up, and of course perceived\r\nwhy, and at whom she barked. He whistled to call her off; she only barked the\r\nlouder. She seemed quite bent upon having the glass door opened. Tired, I\r\nsuppose, with her importunity, he threw down his spade, approached, and pushed\r\nthe door ajar. Sylvie burst in all impetuous, sprang to my lap, and with her\r\npaws at my neck, and her little nose and tongue somewhat overpoweringly busy\r\nabout my face, mouth, and eyes, flourished her bushy tail over the desk, and\r\nscattered books and papers far and wide.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel advanced to still the clamour and repair the disarrangement. Having\r\ngathered up the books, he captured Sylvie, and stowed her away under his\r\npalet\u00f4t, where she nestled as quiet as a mouse, her head just peeping forth.\r\nShe was very tiny, and had the prettiest little innocent face, the silkiest\r\nlong ears, the finest dark eyes in the world. I never saw her, but I thought of\r\nPaulina de Bassompierre: forgive the association, reader, it would\r\noccur.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul petted and patted her; the endearments she received were not to be\r\nwondered at; she invited affection by her beauty and her vivacious life.\r\n\n\r\nWhile caressing the spaniel, his eye roved over the papers and books just\r\nreplaced; it settled on the religious tract. His lips moved; he half checked\r\nthe impulse to speak. What! had he promised never to address me more? If so,\r\nhis better nature pronounced the vow \u201cmore honoured in the breach than in the\r\nobservance,\u201d for with a second effort, he spoke.\u2014\u201cYou have not yet read the\r\nbrochure, I presume? It is not sufficiently inviting?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I had read it.\r\n\n\r\nHe waited, as if wishing me to give an opinion upon it unasked. Unasked,\r\nhowever, I was in no mood to do or say anything. If any concessions were to be\r\nmade\u2014if any advances were demanded\u2014that was the affair of the very docile pupil\r\nof P\u00e8re Silas, not mine. His eye settled upon me gently: there was mildness at\r\nthe moment in its blue ray\u2014there was solicitude\u2014a shade of pathos; there were\r\nmeanings composite and contrasted\u2014reproach melting into remorse. At the moment\r\nprobably, he would have been glad to see something emotional in me. I could not\r\nshow it. In another minute, however, I should have betrayed confusion, had I\r\nnot bethought myself to take some quill-pens from my desk, and begin soberly to\r\nmend them.\r\n\n\r\nI knew that action would give a turn to his mood. He never liked to see me mend\r\npens; my knife was always dull-edged\u2014my hand, too, was unskilful; I hacked and\r\nchipped. On this occasion I cut my own finger\u2014half on purpose. I wanted to\r\nrestore him to his natural state, to set him at his ease, to get him to chide.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMaladroit!\u201d he cried at last, \u201cshe will make mincemeat of her hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe put Sylvie down, making her lie quiet beside his bonnet-grec, and, depriving\r\nme of the pens and penknife, proceeded to slice, nib, and point with the\r\naccuracy and celerity of a machine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I like the little book?\u201d he now inquired.\r\n\n\r\nSuppressing a yawn, I said I hardly knew.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad it moved me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought it had made me a little sleepy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cAllons donc! It was of no use taking that tone with him. Bad\r\nas I was\u2014and he should be sorry to have to name all my faults at a breath\u2014God\r\nand nature had given me \u2018trop de sensibilit\u00e9 et de sympathie\u2019 not to be\r\nprofoundly affected by an appeal so touching.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I responded, rousing myself quickly, \u201cI was not affected at all\u2014not a\r\nwhit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd in proof, I drew from my pocket a perfectly dry handkerchief, still clean\r\nand in its folds.\r\n\n\r\nHereupon I was made the object of a string of strictures rather piquant than\r\npolite. I listened with zest. After those two days of unnatural silence, it was\r\nbetter than music to hear M. Paul haranguing again just in his old fashion. I\r\nlistened, and meantime solaced myself and Sylvie with the contents of a\r\nbonbonni\u00e8re, which M. Emanuel\u2019s gifts kept well supplied with chocolate\r\ncomfits: It pleased him to see even a small matter from his hand duly\r\nappreciated. He looked at me and the spaniel while we shared the spoil; he put\r\nup his penknife. Touching my hand with the bundle of new-cut quills, he\r\nsaid:\u2014\u201cDites donc, petite s\u0153ur\u2014speak frankly\u2014what have you thought of me\r\nduring the last two days?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut of this question I would take no manner of notice; its purport made my eyes\r\nfill. I caressed Sylvie assiduously. M. Paul, leaning\u2014over the desk, bent\r\ntowards me:\u2014\u201cI called myself your brother,\u201d he said: \u201cI hardly know what I\r\nam\u2014brother\u2014friend\u2014I cannot tell. I know I think of you\u2014I feel I wish, you\r\nwell\u2014but I must check myself; you are to be feared. My best friends point out\r\ndanger, and whisper caution.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do right to listen to your friends. By all means be cautious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is your religion\u2014your strange, self-reliant, invulnerable creed, whose\r\ninfluence seems to clothe you in, I know not what, unblessed panoply. You are\r\ngood\u2014P\u00e8re Silas calls you good, and loves you\u2014but your terrible, proud, earnest\r\nProtestantism, there is the danger. It expresses itself by your eye at times;\r\nand again, it gives you certain tones and certain gestures that make my flesh\r\ncreep. You are not demonstrative, and yet, just now\u2014when you handled that\r\ntract\u2014my God! I thought Lucifer smiled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I don\u2019t respect that tract\u2014what then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot respect that tract? But it is the pure essence of faith, love, charity! I\r\nthought it would touch you: in its gentleness, I trusted that it could not\r\nfail. I laid it in your desk with a prayer: I must indeed be a sinner: Heaven\r\nwill not hear the petitions that come warmest from my heart. You scorn my\r\nlittle offering. Oh, cela me fait mal!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I don\u2019t scorn it\u2014at least, not as your gift. Monsieur, sit down;\r\nlisten to me. I am not a heathen, I am not hard-hearted, I am not unchristian,\r\nI am not dangerous, as they tell you; I would not trouble your faith; you\r\nbelieve in God and Christ and the Bible, and so do I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut do you believe in the Bible? Do you receive Revelation? What limits\r\nare there to the wild, careless daring of your country and sect. P\u00e8re Silas\r\ndropped dark hints.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBy dint of persuasion, I made him half-define these hints; they amounted to\r\ncrafty Jesuit-slanders. That night M. Paul and I talked seriously and closely.\r\nHe pleaded, he argued. I could not argue\u2014a fortunate incapacity; it\r\nneeded but triumphant, logical opposition to effect all the director wished to\r\nbe effected; but I could talk in my own way\u2014the way M. Paul was used to\u2014and of\r\nwhich he could follow the meanderings and fill the hiatus, and pardon the\r\nstrange stammerings, strange to him no longer. At ease with him, I could defend\r\nmy creed and faith in my own fashion; in some degree I could lull his\r\nprejudices. He was not satisfied when he went away, hardly was he appeased; but\r\nhe was made thoroughly to feel that Protestants were not necessarily the\r\nirreverent Pagans his director had insinuated; he was made to comprehend\r\nsomething of their mode of honouring the Light, the Life, the Word; he was\r\nenabled partly to perceive that, while their veneration for things venerable\r\nwas not quite like that cultivated in his Church, it had its own, perhaps,\r\ndeeper power\u2014its own more solemn awe.\r\n\n\r\nI found that P\u00e8re Silas (himself, I must repeat, not a bad man, though the\r\nadvocate of a bad cause) had darkly stigmatized Protestants in general, and\r\nmyself by inference, with strange names, had ascribed to us strange \u201cisms;\u201d\r\nMonsieur Emanuel revealed all this in his frank fashion, which knew not\r\nsecretiveness, looking at me as he spoke with a kind, earnest fear, almost\r\ntrembling lest there should be truth in the charges. P\u00e8re Silas, it seems, had\r\nclosely watched me, had ascertained that I went by turns, and indiscriminately,\r\nto the three Protestant Chapels of Villette\u2014the French, German, and\r\nEnglish\u2014id est, the Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopalian. Such\r\nliberality argued in the father\u2019s eyes profound indifference\u2014who tolerates all,\r\nhe reasoned, can be attached to none. Now, it happened that I had often\r\nsecretly wondered at the minute and unimportant character of the differences\r\nbetween these three sects\u2014at the unity and identity of their vital doctrines: I\r\nsaw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused into one grand Holy\r\nAlliance, and I respected them all, though I thought that in each there were\r\nfaults of form, incumbrances, and trivialities. Just what I thought, that did I\r\ntell M. Emanuel, and explained to him that my own last appeal, the guide to\r\nwhich I looked, and the teacher which I owned, must always be the Bible itself,\r\nrather than any sect, of whatever name or nation.\r\n\n\r\nHe left me soothed, yet full of solicitude, breathing a wish, as strong as a\r\nprayer, that if I were wrong, Heaven would lead me right. I heard, poured forth\r\non the threshold, some fervid murmurings to \u201cMarie, Reine du Ciel,\u201d some deep\r\naspiration that his hope might yet be mine.\r\n\n\r\nStrange! I had no such feverish wish to turn him from the faith of his fathers.\r\nI thought Romanism wrong, a great mixed image of gold and clay; but it seemed\r\nto me that this Romanist held the purer elements of his creed with an\r\ninnocency of heart which God must love.\r\n\n\r\nThe preceding conversation passed between eight and nine o\u2019clock of the\r\nevening, in a schoolroom of the quiet Rue Fossette, opening on a sequestered\r\ngarden. Probably about the same, or a somewhat later hour of the succeeding\r\nevening, its echoes, collected by holy obedience, were breathed verbatim in an\r\nattent ear, at the panel of a confessional, in the hoary church of the Magi. It\r\nensued that P\u00e8re Silas paid a visit to Madame Beck, and stirred by I know not\r\nwhat mixture of motives, persuaded her to let him undertake for a time the\r\nEnglishwoman\u2019s spiritual direction.\r\n\n\r\nHereupon I was put through a course of reading\u2014that is, I just glanced at the\r\nbooks lent me; they were too little in my way to be thoroughly read, marked,\r\nlearned, or inwardly digested. And besides, I had a book up-stairs, under my\r\npillow, whereof certain chapters satisfied my needs in the article of spiritual\r\nlore, furnishing such precept and example as, to my heart\u2019s core, I was\r\nconvinced could not be improved on.\r\n\n\r\nThen P\u00e8re Silas showed me the fair side of Rome, her good works; and bade me\r\njudge the tree by its fruits.\r\n\n\r\nIn answer, I felt and I avowed that these works were not the fruits of\r\nRome; they were but her abundant blossoming, but the fair promise she showed\r\nthe world, that bloom when set, savoured not of charity; the apple full formed\r\nwas ignorance, abasement, and bigotry. Out of men\u2019s afflictions and affections\r\nwere forged the rivets of their servitude. Poverty was fed and clothed, and\r\nsheltered, to bind it by obligation to \u201cthe Church;\u201d orphanage was reared and\r\neducated that it might grow up in the fold of \u201cthe Church;\u201d sickness was tended\r\nthat it might die after the formula and in the ordinance of \u201cthe Church;\u201d and\r\nmen were overwrought, and women most murderously sacrificed, and all laid down\r\na world God made pleasant for his creatures\u2019 good, and took up a cross,\r\nmonstrous in its galling weight, that they might serve Rome, prove her\r\nsanctity, confirm her power, and spread the reign of her tyrant \u201cChurch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor man\u2019s good was little done; for God\u2019s glory, less. A thousand ways were\r\nopened with pain, with blood-sweats, with lavishing of life; mountains were\r\ncloven through their breasts, and rocks were split to their base; and all for\r\nwhat? That a Priesthood might march straight on and straight upward to an\r\nall-dominating eminence, whence they might at last stretch the sceptre of their\r\nMoloch \u201cChurch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt will not be. God is not with Rome, and, were human sorrows still for the Son\r\nof God, would he not mourn over her cruelties and ambitions, as once he mourned\r\nover the crimes and woes of doomed Jerusalem!\r\n\n\r\nOh, lovers of power! Oh, mitred aspirants for this world\u2019s kingdoms! an hour\r\nwill come, even to you, when it will be well for your hearts\u2014pausing faint at\r\neach broken beat\u2014that there is a Mercy beyond human compassions, a Love,\r\nstronger than this strong death which even you must face, and before it, fall;\r\na Charity more potent than any sin, even yours; a Pity which redeems\r\nworlds\u2014nay, absolves Priests.\r\n\n\r\nMy third temptation was held out in the pomp of Rome\u2014the glory of her kingdom.\r\nI was taken to the churches on solemn occasions\u2014days of f\u00eate and state; I was\r\nshown the Papal ritual and ceremonial. I looked at it.\r\n\n\r\nMany people\u2014men and women\u2014no doubt far my superiors in a thousand ways, have\r\nfelt this display impressive, have declared that though their Reason protested,\r\ntheir Imagination was subjugated. I cannot say the same. Neither full\r\nprocession, nor high mass, nor swarming tapers, nor swinging censers, nor\r\necclesiastical millinery, nor celestial jewellery, touched my imagination a\r\nwhit. What I saw struck me as tawdry, not grand; as grossly material, not\r\npoetically spiritual.\r\n\n\r\nThis I did not tell P\u00e8re Silas; he was old, he looked venerable: through every\r\nabortive experiment, under every repeated disappointment, he remained\r\npersonally kind to me, and I felt tender of hurting his feelings. But on the\r\nevening of a certain day when, from the balcony of a great house, I had been\r\nmade to witness a huge mingled procession of the church and the army\u2014priests\r\nwith relics, and soldiers with weapons, an obese and aged archbishop, habited\r\nin cambric and lace, looking strangely like a grey daw in bird-of-paradise\r\nplumage, and a band of young girls fantastically robed and\r\ngarlanded\u2014then I spoke my mind to M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not like it,\u201d I told him; \u201cI did not respect such ceremonies; I wished\r\nto see no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd having relieved my conscience by this declaration, I was able to go on,\r\nand, speaking more currently and clearly than my wont, to show him that I had a\r\nmind to keep to my reformed creed; the more I saw of Popery the closer I clung\r\nto Protestantism; doubtless there were errors in every church, but I now\r\nperceived by contrast how severely pure was my own, compared with her whose\r\npainted and meretricious face had been unveiled for my admiration. I told him\r\nhow we kept fewer forms between us and God; retaining, indeed, no more than,\r\nperhaps, the nature of mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due\r\nobservance. I told him I could not look on flowers and tinsel, on wax-lights\r\nand embroidery, at such times and under such circumstances as should be devoted\r\nto lifting the secret vision to Him whose home is Infinity, and His\r\nbeing\u2014Eternity. That when I thought of sin and sorrow, of earthly corruption,\r\nmortal depravity, weighty temporal woe\u2014I could not care for chanting priests or\r\nmumming officials; that when the pains of existence and the terrors of\r\ndissolution pressed before me\u2014when the mighty hope and measureless doubt of the\r\nfuture arose in view\u2014then, even the scientific strain, or the prayer in\r\na language learned and dead, harassed: with hindrance a heart which only longed\r\nto cry\u2014\u201cGod be merciful to me, a sinner!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had so spoken, so declared my faith, and so widely severed myself, from\r\nhim I addressed\u2014then, at last, came a tone accordant, an echo responsive, one\r\nsweet chord of harmony in two conflicting spirits.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhatever say priests or controversialists,\u201d murmured M. Emanuel, \u201cGod is good,\r\nand loves all the sincere. Believe, then, what you can; believe it as you can;\r\none prayer, at least, we have in common; I also cry\u2014\u2018O Dieu, sois appais\u00e9\r\nenvers moi qui suis p\u00e9cheur!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe leaned on the back of my chair. After some thought he again spoke:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow seem in the eyes of that God who made all firmaments, from whose nostrils\r\nissued whatever of life is here, or in the stars shining yonder\u2014how seem the\r\ndifferences of man? But as Time is not for God, nor Space, so neither is\r\nMeasure, nor Comparison. We abase ourselves in our littleness, and we do right;\r\nyet it may be that the constancy of one heart, the truth and faith of one mind\r\naccording to the light He has appointed, import as much to Him as the just\r\nmotion of satellites about their planets, of planets about their suns, of suns\r\naround that mighty unseen centre incomprehensible, irrealizable, with strange\r\nmental effort only divined.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod guide us all! God bless you, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"38": "\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nSUNSHINE.\n\r\nIt was very well for Paulina to decline further correspondence with Graham till\r\nher father had sanctioned the intercourse. But Dr. Bretton could not live\r\nwithin a league of the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy, and not contrive to visit there often. Both\r\nlovers meant at first, I believe, to be distant; they kept their intention so\r\nfar as demonstrative courtship went, but in feeling they soon drew very near.\r\n\n\r\nAll that was best in Graham sought Paulina; whatever in him was noble, awoke,\r\nand grew in her presence. With his past admiration of Miss Fanshawe, I suppose\r\nhis intellect had little to do, but his whole intellect, and his highest\r\ntastes, came in question now. These, like all his faculties, were active, eager\r\nfor nutriment, and alive to gratification when it came.\r\n\n\r\nI cannot say that Paulina designedly led him to talk of books, or formally\r\nproposed to herself for a moment the task of winning him to reflection, or\r\nplanned the improvement of his mind, or so much as fancied his mind could in\r\nany one respect be improved. She thought him very perfect; it was Graham\r\nhimself, who, at first by the merest chance, mentioned some book he had been\r\nreading, and when in her response sounded a welcome harmony of sympathies,\r\nsomething, pleasant to his soul, he talked on, more and better perhaps than he\r\nhad ever talked before on such subjects. She listened with delight, and\r\nanswered with animation. In each successive answer, Graham heard a music waxing\r\nfiner and finer to his sense; in each he found a suggestive, persuasive, magic\r\naccent that opened a scarce-known treasure-house within, showed him unsuspected\r\npower in his own mind, and what was better, latent goodness in his heart. Each\r\nliked the way in which the other talked; the voice, the diction, the expression\r\npleased; each keenly relished the flavour of the other\u2019s wit; they met each\r\nother\u2019s meaning with strange quickness, their thoughts often matched like\r\ncarefully-chosen pearls. Graham had wealth of mirth by nature; Paulina\r\npossessed no such inherent flow of animal spirits\u2014unstimulated, she inclined to\r\nbe thoughtful and pensive\u2014but now she seemed merry as a lark; in her lover\u2019s\r\ngenial presence, she glanced like some soft glad light. How beautiful she grew\r\nin her happiness, I can hardly express, but I wondered to see her. As to that\r\ngentle ice of hers\u2014that reserve on which she had depended; where was it now?\r\nAh! Graham would not long bear it; he brought with him a generous influence\r\nthat soon thawed the timid, self-imposed restriction.\r\n\n\r\nNow were the old Bretton days talked over; perhaps brokenly at first, with a\r\nsort of smiling diffidence, then with opening candour and still growing\r\nconfidence. Graham had made for himself a better opportunity than that he had\r\nwished me to give; he had earned independence of the collateral help that\r\ndisobliging Lucy had refused; all his reminiscences of \u201clittle Polly\u201d found\r\ntheir proper expression in his own pleasant tones, by his own kind and handsome\r\nlips; how much better than if suggested by me.\r\n\n\r\nMore than once when we were alone, Paulina would tell me how wonderful and\r\ncurious it was to discover the richness and accuracy of his memory in this\r\nmatter. How, while he was looking at her, recollections would seem to be\r\nsuddenly quickened in his mind. He reminded her that she had once gathered his\r\nhead in her arms, caressed his leonine graces, and cried out, \u201cGraham, I\r\ndo like you!\u201d He told her how she would set a footstool beside him, and\r\nclimb by its aid to his knee. At this day he said he could recall the sensation\r\nof her little hands smoothing his cheek, or burying themselves in his thick\r\nmane. He remembered the touch of her small forefinger, placed half tremblingly,\r\nhalf curiously, in the cleft in his chin, the lisp, the look with which she\r\nwould name it \u201ca pretty dimple,\u201d then seek his eyes and question why they\r\npierced so, telling him he had a \u201cnice, strange face; far nicer, far stranger,\r\nthan either his mamma or Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChild as I was,\u201d remarked Paulina, \u201cI wonder how I dared be so venturous. To\r\nme he seems now all sacred, his locks are inaccessible, and, Lucy, I feel a\r\nsort of fear, when I look at his firm, marble chin, at his straight Greek\r\nfeatures. Women are called beautiful, Lucy; he is not like a woman, therefore I\r\nsuppose he is not beautiful, but what is he, then? Do other people see him with\r\nmy eyes? Do you admire him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I do, Paulina,\u201d was once my answer to her many questions.\r\n\u201cI never see him. I looked at him twice or thrice about a year ago,\r\nbefore he recognised me, and then I shut my eyes; and if he were to cross their\r\nballs twelve times between each day\u2019s sunset and sunrise, except from memory, I\r\nshould hardly know what shape had gone by.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, what do you mean?\u201d said she, under her breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean that I value vision, and dread being struck stone blind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was best to answer her strongly at once, and to silence for ever the tender,\r\npassionate confidences which left her lips sweet honey, and sometimes dropped\r\nin my ear\u2014molten lead. To me, she commented no more on her lover\u2019s beauty.\r\n\n\r\nYet speak of him she would; sometimes shyly, in quiet, brief phrases; sometimes\r\nwith a tenderness of cadence, and music of voice exquisite in itself; but which\r\nchafed me at times miserably; and then, I know, I gave her stern looks and\r\nwords; but cloudless happiness had dazzled her native clear sight, and she only\r\nthought Lucy\u2014fitful.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpartan girl! Proud Lucy!\u201d she would say, smiling at me. \u201cGraham says you are\r\nthe most peculiar, capricious little woman he knows; but yet you are excellent;\r\nwe both think so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou both think you know not what,\u201d said I. \u201cHave the goodness to make me as\r\nlittle the subject of your mutual talk and thoughts as possible. I have my sort\r\nof life apart from yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut ours, Lucy, is a beautiful life, or it will be; and you shall share it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall share no man\u2019s or woman\u2019s life in this world, as you understand\r\nsharing. I think I have one friend of my own, but am not sure; and till I\r\nam sure, I live solitary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut solitude is sadness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; it is sadness. Life, however; has worse than that. Deeper than\r\nmelancholy, lies heart-break.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you altogether.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere is, in lovers, a certain infatuation of egotism; they will have a witness\r\nof their happiness, cost that witness what it may. Paulina had forbidden\r\nletters, yet Dr. Bretton wrote; she had resolved against correspondence, yet\r\nshe answered, were it only to chide. She showed me these letters; with\r\nsomething of the spoiled child\u2019s wilfulness, and of the heiress\u2019s\r\nimperiousness, she made me read them. As I read Graham\u2019s, I scarce\r\nwondered at her exaction, and understood her pride: they were fine\r\nletters\u2014manly and fond\u2014modest and gallant. Hers must have appeared to him\r\nbeautiful. They had not been written to show her talents; still less, I think,\r\nto express her love. On the contrary, it appeared that she had proposed to\r\nherself the task of hiding that feeling, and bridling her lover\u2019s ardour. But\r\nhow could such letters serve such a purpose? Graham was become dear as her\r\nlife; he drew her like a powerful magnet. For her there was influence\r\nunspeakable in all he uttered, wrote, thought, or looked. With this unconfessed\r\nconfession, her letters glowed; it kindled them, from greeting to adieu.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish papa knew; I do wish papa knew!\u201d began now to be her anxious\r\nmurmur. \u201cI wish, and yet I fear. I can hardly keep Graham back from telling\r\nhim. There is nothing I long for more than to have this affair settled\u2014to speak\r\nout candidly; and yet I dread the crisis. I know, I am certain, papa will be\r\nangry at the first; I fear he will dislike me almost; it will seem to him an\r\nuntoward business; it will be a surprise, a shock: I can hardly foresee its\r\nwhole effect on him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe fact was\u2014her father, long calm, was beginning to be a little stirred: long\r\nblind on one point, an importunate light was beginning to trespass on his eye.\r\n\n\r\nTo her, he said nothing; but when she was not looking at, or perhaps\r\nthinking of him, I saw him gaze and meditate on her.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening\u2014Paulina was in her dressing-room, writing, I believe, to Graham;\r\nshe had left me in the library, reading\u2014M. de Bassompierre came in; he sat\r\ndown: I was about to withdraw; he requested me to remain\u2014gently, yet in a\r\nmanner which showed he wished compliance. He had taken his seat near the\r\nwindow, at a distance from me; he opened a desk; he took from it what looked\r\nlike a memorandum-book; of this book he studied a certain entry for several\r\nminutes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said he, laying it down, \u201cdo you know my little girl\u2019s age?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout eighteen, is it not, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so. This old pocket-book tells me she was born on the 5th of May, in\r\nthe year 18\u2014, eighteen years ago. It is strange; I had lost the just reckoning\r\nof her age. I thought of her as twelve\u2014fourteen\u2014an indefinite date; but she\r\nseemed a child.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is about eighteen,\u201d I repeated. \u201cShe is grown up; she will be no taller.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little jewel!\u201d said M. de Bassompierre, in a tone which penetrated like\r\nsome of his daughter\u2019s accents.\r\n\n\r\nHe sat very thoughtful.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, don\u2019t grieve,\u201d I said; for I knew his feelings, utterly unspoken as they\r\nwere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is the only pearl I have,\u201d he said; \u201cand now others will find out that she\r\nis pure and of price: they will covet her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI made no answer. Graham Bretton had dined with us that day; he had shone both\r\nin converse and looks: I know not what pride of bloom embellished his aspect\r\nand mellowed his intercourse. Under the stimulus of a high hope, something had\r\nunfolded in his whole manner which compelled attention. I think he had purposed\r\non that day to indicate the origin of his endeavours, and the aim of his\r\nambition. M. de Bassompierre had found himself forced, in a manner, to descry\r\nthe direction and catch the character of his homage. Slow in remarking, he was\r\nlogical in reasoning: having once seized the thread, it had guided him through\r\na long labyrinth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is up-stairs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is writing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe writes, does she? Does she receive letters?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone but such as she can show me. And\u2014sir\u2014she\u2014they have long wanted to\r\nconsult you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They don\u2019t think of me\u2014an old father! I am in the way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, M. de Bassompierre\u2014not so\u2014that can\u2019t be! But Paulina must speak for\r\nherself: and Dr. Bretton, too, must be his own advocate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little late. Matters are advanced, it seems.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, till you approve, nothing is done\u2014only they love each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly!\u201d he echoed.\r\n\n\r\nInvested by fate with the part of confidante and mediator, I was obliged to go\r\non: \u201cHundreds of times has Dr. Bretton been on the point of appealing to you,\r\nsir; but, with all his high courage, he fears you mortally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe may well\u2014he may well fear me. He has touched the best thing I have. Had he\r\nbut let her alone, she would have remained a child for years yet. So. Are they\r\nengaged?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey could not become engaged without your permission.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well for you, Miss Snowe, to talk and think with that propriety which\r\nalways characterizes you; but this matter is a grief to me; my little girl was\r\nall I had: I have no more daughters and no son; Bretton might as well have\r\nlooked elsewhere; there are scores of rich and pretty women who would not, I\r\ndaresay, dislike him: he has looks, and conduct, and connection. Would nothing\r\nserve him but my Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf he had never seen your \u2018Polly,\u2019 others might and would have pleased\r\nhim\u2014your niece, Miss Fanshawe, for instance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! I would have given him Ginevra with all my heart; but Polly!\u2014I can\u2019t let\r\nhim have her. No\u2014I can\u2019t. He is not her equal,\u201d he affirmed, rather gruffly.\r\n\u201cIn what particular is he her match? They talk of fortune! I am not an\r\navaricious or interested man, but the world thinks of these things\u2014and Polly\r\nwill be rich.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is known,\u201d said I: \u201call Villette knows her as an heiress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo they talk of my little girl in that light?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey do, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe fell into deep thought. I ventured to say, \u201cWould you, sir, think any one\r\nPaulina\u2019s match? Would you prefer any other to Dr. Bretton? Do you think higher\r\nrank or more wealth would make much difference in your feelings towards a\r\nfuture son-in-law?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou touch me there,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook at the aristocracy of Villette\u2014you would not like them, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should not\u2014never a duc, baron, or vicomte of the lot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am told many of these persons think about her, sir,\u201d I went on, gaining\r\ncourage on finding that I met attention rather than repulse. \u201cOther suitors\r\nwill come, therefore, if Dr. Bretton is refused. Wherever you go, I suppose,\r\naspirants will not be wanting. Independent of heiress-ship, it appears to me\r\nthat Paulina charms most of those who see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes she? How? My little girl is not thought a beauty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, Miss de Bassompierre is very beautiful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u2014begging your pardon, Miss Snowe, but I think you are too partial. I\r\nlike Polly: I like all her ways and all her looks\u2014but then I am her father; and\r\neven I never thought about beauty. She is amusing, fairy-like, interesting to\r\nme;\u2014you must be mistaken in supposing her handsome?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe attracts, sir: she would attract without the advantages of your wealth and\r\nposition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy wealth and position! Are these any bait to Graham? If I thought so\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton knows these points perfectly, as you may be sure, M. de\r\nBassompierre, and values them as any gentleman would\u2014as you would\r\nyourself, under the same circumstances\u2014but they are not his baits. He loves\r\nyour daughter very much; he feels her finest qualities, and they influence him\r\nworthily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! has my little pet \u2018fine qualities?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, sir! did you observe her that evening when so many men of eminence and\r\nlearning dined here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI certainly was rather struck and surprised with her manner that day; its\r\nwomanliness made me smile.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you see those accomplished Frenchmen gather round her in the\r\ndrawing-room?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did; but I thought it was by way of relaxation\u2014as one might amuse one\u2019s self\r\nwith a pretty infant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, she demeaned herself with distinction; and I heard the French gentlemen\r\nsay she was \u2018p\u00e9trie d\u2019esprit et de graces.\u2019 Dr. Bretton thought the same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a good, dear child, that is certain; and I do believe she has\r\nsome character. When I think of it, I was once ill; Polly nursed me; they\r\nthought I should die; she, I recollect, grew at once stronger and tenderer as I\r\ngrew worse in health. And as I recovered, what a sunbeam she was in my\r\nsick-room! Yes; she played about my chair as noiselessly and as cheerful as\r\nlight. And now she is sought in marriage! I don\u2019t want to part with her,\u201d said\r\nhe, and he groaned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have known Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long,\u201d I suggested, \u201cit would be less\r\nlike separation to give her to him than to another.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe reflected rather gloomily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue. I have long known Louisa Bretton,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe and I are indeed\r\nold, old friends; a sweet, kind girl she was when she was young. You talk of\r\nbeauty, Miss Snowe! she was handsome, if you will\u2014tall, straight, and\r\nblooming\u2014not the mere child or elf my Polly seems to me: at eighteen, Louisa\r\nhad a carriage and stature fit for a princess. She is a comely and a good woman\r\nnow. The lad is like her; I have always thought so, and favoured and wished him\r\nwell. Now he repays me by this robbery! My little treasure used to love her old\r\nfather dearly and truly. It is all over now, doubtless\u2014I am an incumbrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe door opened\u2014his \u201clittle treasure\u201d came in. She was dressed, so to speak, in\r\nevening beauty; that animation which sometimes comes with the close of day,\r\nwarmed her eye and cheek; a tinge of summer crimson heightened her complexion;\r\nher curls fell full and long on her lily neck; her white dress suited the heat\r\nof June. Thinking me alone, she had brought in her hand the letter just\r\nwritten\u2014brought it folded but unsealed. I was to read it. When she saw her\r\nfather, her tripping step faltered a little, paused a moment\u2014the colour in her\r\ncheek flowed rosy over her whole face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly,\u201d said M. de Bassompierre, in a low voice, with a grave smile, \u201cdo you\r\nblush at seeing papa? That is something new.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t blush\u2014I never do blush,\u201d affirmed she, while another eddy from\r\nthe heart sent up its scarlet. \u201cBut I thought you were in the dining-room, and\r\nI wanted Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought I was with John Graham Bretton, I suppose? But he has just been\r\ncalled out: he will be back soon, Polly. He can post your letter for you; it\r\nwill save Matthieu a \u2018course,\u2019 as he calls it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t post letters,\u201d said she, rather pettishly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you do with them, then?\u2014come here and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBoth her mind and gesture seemed to hesitate a second\u2014to say \u201cShall I\r\ncome?\u201d\u2014but she approached.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long is it since you became a letter-writer, Polly? It only seems\r\nyesterday when you were at your pot-hooks, labouring away absolutely with both\r\nhands at the pen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, they are not letters to send to the post in your letter-bag; they are\r\nonly notes, which I give now and then into the person\u2019s hands, just to\r\nsatisfy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe person! That means Miss Snowe, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa\u2014not Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho then? Perhaps Mrs. Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa\u2014not Mrs. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho, then, my little daughter? Tell papa the truth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, papa!\u201d she cried with earnestness, \u201cI will\u2014I will tell you the\r\ntruth\u2014all the truth; I am glad to tell you\u2014glad, though I tremble.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe did tremble: growing excitement, kindling feeling, and also\r\ngathering courage, shook her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hate to hide my actions from you, papa. I fear you and love you above\r\neverything but God. Read the letter; look at the address.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe laid it on his knee. He took it up and read it through; his hand shaking,\r\nhis eyes glistening meantime.\r\n\n\r\nHe re-folded it, and viewed the writer with a strange, tender, mournful amaze.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan she write so\u2014the little thing that stood at my knee but yesterday?\r\nCan she feel so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, is it wrong? Does it pain you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it, my innocent little Mary; but it pains me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, papa, listen! You shall not be pained by me. I would give up\r\neverything\u2014almost\u201d (correcting herself); \u201cI would die rather than make you\r\nunhappy; that would be too wicked!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes the letter not please you? Must it not go? Must it be torn? It shall, for\r\nyour sake, if you order it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI order nothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOrder something, papa; express your wish; only don\u2019t hurt, don\u2019t grieve\r\nGraham. I cannot, cannot bear that. I love you, papa; but I love Graham\r\ntoo\u2014because\u2014because\u2014it is impossible to help it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis splendid Graham is a young scamp, Polly\u2014that is my present notion of him:\r\nit will surprise you to hear that, for my part, I do not love him one whit. Ah!\r\nyears ago I saw something in that lad\u2019s eye I never quite fathomed\u2014something\r\nhis mother has not\u2014a depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too\r\nfar; now, suddenly, I find myself taken over the crown of the head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, you don\u2019t\u2014you have not fallen in; you are safe on the bank; you can do\r\nas you please; your power is despotic; you can shut me up in a convent, and\r\nbreak Graham\u2019s heart to-morrow, if you choose to be so cruel. Now, autocrat,\r\nnow czar, will you do this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOff with him to Siberia, red whiskers and all; I say, I don\u2019t like him, Polly,\r\nand I wonder that you should.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa,\u201d said she, \u201cdo you know you are very naughty? I never saw you look so\r\ndisagreeable, so unjust, so almost vindictive before. There is an expression in\r\nyour face which does not belong to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOff with him!\u201d pursued Mr. Home, who certainly did look sorely crossed and\r\nannoyed\u2014even a little bitter; \u201cbut, I suppose, if he went, Polly would pack a\r\nbundle and run after him; her heart is fairly won\u2014won, and weaned from her old\r\nfather.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I say it is naughty, it is decidedly wrong, to talk in that way. I am\r\nnot weaned from you, and no human being and no mortal influence\r\ncan wean me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe married, Polly! Espouse the red whiskers. Cease to be a daughter; go and be\r\na wife!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRed whiskers! I wonder what you mean, papa. You should take care of prejudice.\r\nYou sometimes say to me that all the Scotch, your countrymen, are the victims\r\nof prejudice. It is proved now, I think, when no distinction is to be made\r\nbetween red and deep nut-brown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave the prejudiced old Scotchman; go away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stood looking at him a minute. She wanted to show firmness, superiority to\r\ntaunts; knowing her father\u2019s character, guessing his few foibles, she had\r\nexpected the sort of scene which was now transpiring; it did not take her by\r\nsurprise, and she desired to let it pass with dignity, reliant upon reaction.\r\nHer dignity stood her in no stead. Suddenly her soul melted in her eyes; she\r\nfell on his neck:\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t leave you, papa; I\u2019ll never leave you. I won\u2019t pain\r\nyou! I\u2019ll never pain you!\u201d was her cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy lamb! my treasure!\u201d murmured the loving though rugged sire. He said no more\r\nfor the moment; indeed, those two words were hoarse.\r\n\n\r\nThe room was now darkening. I heard a movement, a step without. Thinking it\r\nmight be a servant coming with candles, I gently opened, to prevent intrusion.\r\nIn the ante-room stood no servant: a tall gentleman was placing his hat on the\r\ntable, drawing off his gloves slowly\u2014lingering, waiting, it seemed to me. He\r\ncalled me neither by sign nor word; yet his eye said:\u2014\u201cLucy, come here.\u201d And I\r\nwent.\r\n\n\r\nOver his face a smile flowed, while he looked down on me: no temper, save his\r\nown, would have expressed by a smile the sort of agitation which now fevered\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. de Bassompierre is there\u2014is he not?\u201d he inquired, pointing to the library.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe noticed me at dinner? He understood me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am brought up for judgment, then, and so is she?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Home\u201d (we now and always continued to term him Mr. Home at times) \u201cis\r\ntalking to his daughter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! These are sharp moments, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was quite stirred up; his young hand trembled; a vital (I was going to write\r\nmortal, but such words ill apply to one all living like him)\u2014a vital\r\nsuspense now held, now hurried, his breath: in all this trouble his smile never\r\nfaded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he very angry, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is very faithful, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will be done unto me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham, your star must be fortunate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust it? Kind prophet! So cheered, I should be a faint heart indeed to quail.\r\nI think I find all women faithful, Lucy. I ought to love them, and I do. My\r\nmother is good; she is divine; and you are true as steel. Are you\r\nnot?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen give me thy hand, my little god-sister: it is a friendly little hand to\r\nme, and always has been. And now for the great venture. God be with the right.\r\nLucy, say Amen!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe turned, and waited till I said \u201cAmen!\u201d\u2014which I did to please him: the old\r\ncharm, in doing as he bid me, came back. I wished him success; and successful I\r\nknew he would be. He was born victor, as some are born vanquished.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFollow me!\u201d he said; and I followed him into Mr. Home\u2019s presence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat is my sentence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe father looked at him: the daughter kept her face hid.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Bretton,\u201d said Mr. Home, \u201cyou have given me the usual reward of\r\nhospitality. I entertained you; you have taken my best. I was always glad to\r\nsee you; you were glad to see the one precious thing I had. You spoke me fair;\r\nand, meantime, I will not say you robbed me, but I am bereaved, and what\r\nI have lost, you, it seems, have won.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I cannot repent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRepent! Not you! You triumph, no doubt: John Graham, you descended partly from\r\na Highlander and a chief, and there is a trace of the Celt in all you look,\r\nspeak, and think. You have his cunning and his charm. The red\u2014(Well then,\r\nPolly, the fair) hair, the tongue of guile, and brain of wile, are all\r\ncome down by inheritance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I feel honest enough,\u201d said Graham; and a genuine English blush\r\ncovered his face with its warm witness of sincerity. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he added, \u201cI\r\nwon\u2019t deny that in some respects you accuse me justly. In your presence I have\r\nalways had a thought which I dared not show you. I did truly regard you as the\r\npossessor of the most valuable thing the world owns for me. I wished for it: I\r\ntried for it. Sir, I ask for it now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJohn, you ask much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery much, sir. It must come from your generosity, as a gift; from your\r\njustice, as a reward. I can never earn it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy! Listen to the Highland tongue!\u201d said Mr. Home. \u201cLook up, Polly! Answer\r\nthis \u2018braw wooer;\u2019 send him away!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked up. She shyly glanced at her eager, handsome suitor. She gazed\r\ntenderly on her furrowed sire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I love you both,\u201d said she; \u201cI can take care of you both. I need not\r\nsend Graham away\u2014he can live here; he will be no inconvenience,\u201d she alleged\r\nwith that simplicity of phraseology which at times was wont to make both her\r\nfather and Graham smile. They smiled now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe will be a prodigious inconvenience to me,\u201d still persisted Mr. Home. \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t want him, Polly, he is too tall; he is in my way. Tell him to march.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will get used to him, papa. He seemed exceedingly tall to me at first\u2014like\r\na tower when I looked up at him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have him\r\notherwise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI object to him altogether, Polly; I can do without a son-in-law. I should\r\nnever have requested the best man in the land to stand to me in that relation.\r\nDismiss this gentleman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he has known you so long, papa, and suits you so well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuits me, forsooth! Yes; he has pretended to make my opinions and\r\ntastes his own. He has humoured me for good reasons. I think, Polly, you and I\r\nwill bid him good-by.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTill to-morrow only. Shake hands with Graham, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I think not: I am not friends with him. Don\u2019t think to coax me between\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed, you are friends. Graham, stretch out your right hand.\r\nPapa, put out yours. Now, let them touch. Papa, don\u2019t be stiff; close your\r\nfingers; be pliant\u2014there! But that is not a clasp\u2014it is a grasp? Papa, you\r\ngrasp like a vice. You crush Graham\u2019s hand to the bone; you hurt him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe must have hurt him; for he wore a massive ring, set round with brilliants,\r\nof which the sharp facets cut into Graham\u2019s flesh and drew blood: but pain only\r\nmade Dr. John laugh, as anxiety had made him smile.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome with me into my study,\u201d at last said Mr. Home to the doctor. They went.\r\nTheir intercourse was not long, but I suppose it was conclusive. The suitor had\r\nto undergo an interrogatory and a scrutiny on many things. Whether Dr. Bretton\r\nwas at times guileful in look and language or not, there was a sound foundation\r\nbelow. His answers, I understood afterwards, evinced both wisdom and integrity.\r\nHe had managed his affairs well. He had struggled through entanglements; his\r\nfortunes were in the way of retrieval; he proved himself in a position to\r\nmarry.\r\n\n\r\nOnce more the father and lover appeared in the library. M. de Bassompierre shut\r\nthe door; he pointed to his daughter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake her,\u201d he said. \u201cTake her, John Bretton: and may God deal with you as you\r\ndeal with her!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNot long after, perhaps a fortnight, I saw three persons, Count de\r\nBassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton, sitting on one seat, under\r\na low-spreading and umbrageous tree, in the grounds of the palace at Bois\r\nl\u2019Etang. They had come thither to enjoy a summer evening: outside the\r\nmagnificent gates their carriage waited to take them home; the green sweeps of\r\nturf spread round them quiet and dim; the palace rose at a distance, white as a\r\ncrag on Pentelicus; the evening star shone above it; a forest of flowering\r\nshrubs embalmed the climate of this spot; the hour was still and sweet; the\r\nscene, but for this group, was solitary.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina sat between the two gentlemen: while they conversed, her little hands\r\nwere busy at some work; I thought at first she was binding a nosegay. No; with\r\nthe tiny pair of scissors, glittering in her lap, she had severed spoils from\r\neach manly head beside her, and was now occupied in plaiting together the grey\r\nlock and the golden wave. The plait woven\u2014no silk-thread being at hand to bind\r\nit\u2014a tress of her own hair was made to serve that purpose; she tied it like a\r\nknot, prisoned it in a locket, and laid it on her heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cthere is an amulet made, which has virtue to keep you two\r\nalways friends. You can never quarrel so long as I wear this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAn amulet was indeed made, a spell framed which rendered enmity impossible. She\r\nwas become a bond to both, an influence over each, a mutual concord. From them\r\nshe drew her happiness, and what she borrowed, she, with interest, gave back.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there, indeed, such happiness on earth?\u201d I asked, as I watched the father,\r\nthe daughter, the future husband, now united\u2014all blessed and blessing.\r\n\n\r\nYes; it is so. Without any colouring of romance, or any exaggeration of fancy,\r\nit is so. Some real lives do\u2014for some certain days or years\u2014actually anticipate\r\nthe happiness of Heaven; and, I believe, if such perfect happiness is once felt\r\nby good people (to the wicked it never comes), its sweet effect is never wholly\r\nlost. Whatever trials follow, whatever pains of sickness or shades of death,\r\nthe glory precedent still shines through, cheering the keen anguish, and\r\ntinging the deep cloud.\r\n\n\r\nI will go farther. I do believe there are some human beings so born, so\r\nreared, so guided from a soft cradle to a calm and late grave, that no\r\nexcessive suffering penetrates their lot, and no tempestuous blackness\r\novercasts their journey. And often, these are not pampered, selfish beings, but\r\nNature\u2019s elect, harmonious and benign; men and women mild with charity, kind\r\nagents of God\u2019s kind attributes.\r\n\n\r\nLet me not delay the happy truth. Graham Bretton and Paulina de Bassompierre\r\nwere married, and such an agent did Dr. Bretton prove. He did not with time\r\ndegenerate; his faults decayed, his virtues ripened; he rose in intellectual\r\nrefinement, he won in moral profit: all dregs filtered away, the clear wine\r\nsettled bright and tranquil. Bright, too, was the destiny of his sweet wife.\r\nShe kept her husband\u2019s love, she aided in his progress\u2014of his happiness she was\r\nthe corner stone.\r\n\n\r\nThis pair was blessed indeed, for years brought them, with great prosperity,\r\ngreat goodness: they imparted with open hand, yet wisely. Doubtless they knew\r\ncrosses, disappointments, difficulties; but these were well borne. More than\r\nonce, too, they had to look on Him whose face flesh scarce can see and live:\r\nthey had to pay their tribute to the King of Terrors. In the fulness of years,\r\nM. de Bassompierre was taken: in ripe old age departed Louisa Bretton. Once\r\neven there rose a cry in their halls, of Rachel weeping for her children; but\r\nothers sprang healthy and blooming to replace the lost: Dr. Bretton saw himself\r\nlive again in a son who inherited his looks and his disposition; he had stately\r\ndaughters, too, like himself: these children he reared with a suave, yet a firm\r\nhand; they grew up according to inheritance and nurture.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, I do but speak the truth when I say that these two lives of Graham\r\nand Paulina were blessed, like that of Jacob\u2019s favoured son, with \u201cblessings of\r\nHeaven above, blessings of the deep that lies under.\u201d It was so, for God saw\r\nthat it was good.\r\n\n"}
{"39": "\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nCLOUD.\n\r\nBut it is not so for all. What then? His will be done, as done it surely will\r\nbe, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The impulse of creation\r\nforwards it; the strength of powers, seen and unseen, has its fulfilment in\r\ncharge. Proof of a life to come must be given. In fire and in blood, if\r\nneedful, must that proof be written. In fire and in blood do we trace the\r\nrecord throughout nature. In fire and in blood does it cross our own\r\nexperience. Sufferer, faint not through terror of this burning evidence. Tired\r\nwayfarer, gird up thy loins; look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother\r\nmourners, join in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world\r\nstretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be our cross\r\nour banner. For staff we have His promise, whose \u201cword is tried, whose way\r\nperfect:\u201d for present hope His providence, \u201cwho gives the shield of salvation,\r\nwhose gentleness makes great;\u201d for final home His bosom, who \u201cdwells in the\r\nheight of Heaven;\u201d for crowning prize a glory, exceeding and eternal. Let us so\r\nrun that we may obtain: let us endure hardness as good soldiers; let us finish\r\nour course, and keep the faith, reliant in the issue to come off more than\r\nconquerors: \u201cArt thou not from everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn a Thursday morning we were all assembled in classe, waiting for the lesson\r\nof literature. The hour was come; we expected the master.\r\n\n\r\nThe pupils of the first classe sat very still; the cleanly-written compositions\r\nprepared since the last lesson lay ready before them, neatly tied with ribbon,\r\nwaiting to be gathered by the hand of the Professor as he made his rapid round\r\nof the desks. The month was July, the morning fine, the glass-door stood ajar,\r\nthrough it played a fresh breeze, and plants, growing at the lintel, waved,\r\nbent, looked in, seeming to whisper tidings.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was not always quite punctual; we scarcely wondered at his being a\r\nlittle late, but we wondered when the door at last opened and, instead of him\r\nwith his swiftness and his fire, there came quietly upon us the cautious Madame\r\nBeck.\r\n\n\r\nShe approached M. Paul\u2019s desk; she stood before it; she drew round her the\r\nlight shawl covering her shoulders; beginning to speak in low, yet firm tones,\r\nand with a fixed gaze, she said, \u201cThis morning there will be no lesson of\r\nliterature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe second paragraph of her address followed, after about two minutes\u2019 pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week. I shall require at\r\nleast that space of time to find an efficient substitute for M. Emanuel.\r\nMeanwhile, it shall be our study to fill the blanks usefully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour Professor, ladies,\u201d she went on, \u201cintends, if possible, duly to take\r\nleave of you. At the present moment he has not leisure for that ceremony. He is\r\npreparing for a long voyage. A very sudden and urgent summons of duty calls him\r\nto a great distance. He has decided to leave Europe for an indefinite time.\r\nPerhaps he may tell you more himself. Ladies, instead of the usual lesson with\r\nM. Emanuel, you will, this morning, read English with Mademoiselle Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe bent her head courteously, drew closer the folds of her shawl, and passed\r\nfrom the classe.\r\n\n\r\nA great silence fell: then a murmur went round the room: I believe some pupils\r\nwept.\r\n\n\r\nSome time elapsed. The noise, the whispering, the occasional sobbing increased.\r\nI became conscious of a relaxation of discipline, a sort of growing disorder,\r\nas if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn, and that surveillance had\r\nvirtually left the classe. Habit and the sense of duty enabled me to rally\r\nquickly, to rise in my usual way, to speak in my usual tone, to enjoin, and\r\nfinally to establish quiet. I made the English reading long and close. I kept\r\nthem at it the whole morning. I remember feeling a sentiment of impatience\r\ntowards the pupils who sobbed. Indeed, their emotion was not of much value: it\r\nwas only an hysteric agitation. I told them so unsparingly. I half ridiculed\r\nthem. I was severe. The truth was, I could not do with their tears, or that\r\ngasping sound; I could not bear it. A rather weak-minded, low-spirited pupil\r\nkept it up when the others had done; relentless necessity obliged and assisted\r\nme so to accost her, that she dared not carry on the demonstration, that she\r\nwas forced to conquer the convulsion.\r\n\n\r\nThat girl would have had a right to hate me, except that, when school was over\r\nand her companions departing, I ordered her to stay, and when they were gone, I\r\ndid what I had never done to one among them before\u2014pressed her to my heart and\r\nkissed her cheek. But, this impulse yielded to, I speedily put her out of the\r\nclasse, for, upon that poignant strain, she wept more bitterly than ever.\r\n\n\r\nI filled with occupation every minute of that day, and should have liked to sit\r\nup all night if I might have kept a candle burning; the night, however, proved\r\na bad time, and left bad effects, preparing me ill for the next day\u2019s ordeal of\r\ninsufferable gossip. Of course this news fell under general discussion. Some\r\nlittle reserve had accompanied the first surprise: that soon wore off; every\r\nmouth opened; every tongue wagged; teachers, pupils, the very servants, mouthed\r\nthe name of \u201cEmanuel.\u201d He, whose connection with the school was contemporary\r\nwith its commencement, thus suddenly to withdraw! All felt it strange.\r\n\n\r\nThey talked so much, so long, so often, that, out of the very multitude of\r\ntheir words and rumours, grew at last some intelligence. About the third day I\r\nheard it said that he was to sail in a week; then\u2014that he was bound for the\r\nWest Indies. I looked at Madame Beck\u2019s face, and into her eyes, for disproof or\r\nconfirmation of this report; I perused her all over for information, but no\r\npart of her disclosed more than what was unperturbed and commonplace.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis secession was an immense loss to her,\u201d she alleged. \u201cShe did not know how\r\nshe should fill up the vacancy. She was so used to her kinsman, he had become\r\nher right hand; what should she do without him? She had opposed the step, but\r\nM. Paul had convinced her it was his duty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe said all this in public, in classe, at the dinner-table, speaking audibly\r\nto Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy was it his duty?\u201d I could have asked her that. I had impulses to take hold\r\nof her suddenly, as she calmly passed me in classe, to stretch out my hand and\r\ngrasp her fast, and say, \u201cStop. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.\r\nWhy is it his duty to go into banishment?\u201d But Madame always addressed\r\nsome other teacher, and never looked at me, never seemed conscious I could have\r\na care in the question.\r\n\n\r\nThe week wore on. Nothing more was said about M. Emanuel coming to bid us\r\ngood-by; and none seemed anxious for his coming; none questioned whether or not\r\nhe would come; none betrayed torment lest he should depart silent and unseen;\r\nincessantly did they talk, and never, in all their talk, touched on this vital\r\npoint. As to Madame, she of course could see him, and say to him as much as she\r\npleased. What should she care whether or not he appeared in the\r\nschoolroom?\r\n\n\r\nThe week consumed. We were told that he was going on such a day, that his\r\ndestination was \u201cBasseterre in Guadaloupe:\u201d the business which called him\r\nabroad related to a friend\u2019s interests, not his own: I thought as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBasseterre in Guadaloupe.\u201d I had little sleep about this time, but whenever I\r\ndid slumber, it followed infallibly that I was quickly roused with a\r\nstart, while the words \u201cBasseterre,\u201d \u201cGuadaloupe,\u201d seemed pronounced over my\r\npillow, or ran athwart the darkness round and before me, in zigzag characters\r\nof red or violet light.\r\n\n\r\nFor what I felt there was no help, and how could I help feeling? M. Emanuel had\r\nbeen very kind to me of late days; he had been growing hourly better and\r\nkinder. It was now a month since we had settled the theological difference, and\r\nin all that time there had been no quarrel. Nor had our peace been the cold\r\ndaughter of divorce; we had not lived aloof; he had come oftener, he had talked\r\nwith me more than before; he had spent hours with me, with temper soothed, with\r\neye content, with manner home-like and mild. Kind subjects of conversation had\r\ngrown between us; he had inquired into my plans of life, and I had communicated\r\nthem; the school project pleased him; he made me repeat it more than once,\r\nthough he called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was over; the mutual\r\nunderstanding was settling and fixing; feelings of union and hope made\r\nthemselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection and deep esteem and dawning\r\ntrust had each fastened its bond.\r\n\n\r\nWhat quiet lessons I had about this time! No more taunts on my \u201cintellect,\u201d no\r\nmore menaces of grating public shows! How sweetly, for the jealous gibe, and\r\nthe more jealous, half-passionate eulogy, were substituted a mute, indulgent\r\nhelp, a fond guidance, and a tender forbearance which forgave but never\r\npraised. There were times when he would sit for many minutes and not speak at\r\nall; and when dusk or duty brought separation, he would leave with words like\r\nthese, \u201cIl est doux, le repos! Il est pr\u00e9cieux le calme bonheur!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, not ten short days since, he joined me whilst walking in my alley.\r\nHe took my hand. I looked up in his face. I thought he meant to arrest my\r\nattention.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBonne petite amie!\u201d said he, softly; \u201cdouce consolatrice!\u201d But through his\r\ntouch, and with his words, a new feeling and a strange thought found a course.\r\nCould it be that he was becoming more than friend or brother? Did his look\r\nspeak a kindness beyond fraternity or amity?\r\n\n\r\nHis eloquent look had more to say, his hand drew me forward, his interpreting\r\nlips stirred. No. Not now. Here into the twilight alley broke an interruption:\r\nit came dual and ominous: we faced two bodeful forms\u2014a woman\u2019s and a\r\npriest\u2019s\u2014Madame Beck and P\u00e8re Silas.\r\n\n\r\nThe aspect of the latter I shall never forget. On the first impulse it\r\nexpressed a Jean-Jacques sensibility, stirred by the signs of affection just\r\nsurprised; then, immediately, darkened over it the jaundice of ecclesiastical\r\njealousy. He spoke to me with unction. He looked on his pupil with\r\nsternness. As to Madame Beck, she, of course, saw nothing\u2014nothing; though her\r\nkinsman retained in her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner, not\r\nsuffering withdrawal, but clasping it close and fast.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing these incidents, that sudden announcement of departure had struck me\r\nat first as incredible. Indeed, it was only frequent repetition, and the\r\ncredence of the hundred and fifty minds round me, which forced on me its full\r\nacceptance. As to that week of suspense, with its blank, yet burning days,\r\nwhich brought from him no word of explanation\u2014I remember, but I cannot describe\r\nits passage.\r\n\n\r\nThe last day broke. Now would he visit us. Now he would come and speak his\r\nfarewell, or he would vanish mute, and be seen by us nevermore.\r\n\n\r\nThis alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living creature in\r\nthat school. All rose at the usual hour; all breakfasted as usual; all, without\r\nreference to, or apparent thought of their late Professor, betook themselves\r\nwith wonted phlegm to their ordinary duties.\r\n\n\r\nSo oblivious was the house, so tame, so trained its proceedings, so inexpectant\r\nits aspect\u2014I scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere thus stagnant, thus\r\nsmothering. Would no one lend me a voice? Had no one a wish, no one a word, no\r\none a prayer to which I could say\u2014Amen?\r\n\n\r\nI had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest trifle\u2014a treat, a holiday, a\r\nlesson\u2019s remission; they could not, they would not now band to besiege\r\nMadame Beck, and insist on a last interview with a Master who had certainly\r\nbeen loved, at least by some\u2014loved as they could love\u2014but, oh! what\r\nis the love of the multitude?\r\n\n\r\nI knew where he lived: I knew where he was to be heard of, or communicated\r\nwith; the distance was scarce a stone\u2019s-throw: had it been in the next\r\nroom\u2014unsummoned, I could make no use of my knowledge. To follow, to seek out,\r\nto remind, to recall\u2014for these things I had no faculty.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm: had he passed silent and\r\nunnoticing, silent and stirless should I have suffered him to go by.\r\n\n\r\nMorning wasted. Afternoon came, and I thought all was over. My heart trembled\r\nin its place. My blood was troubled in its current. I was quite sick, and\r\nhardly knew how to keep at my post\u2014or do my work. Yet the little world round me\r\nplodded on indifferent; all seemed jocund, free of care, or fear, or thought:\r\nthe very pupils who, seven days since, had wept hysterically at a startling\r\npiece of news, appeared quite to have forgotten the news, its import, and their\r\nemotion.\r\n\n\r\nA little before five o\u2019clock, the hour of dismissal, Madame Beck sent for me to\r\nher chamber, to read over and translate some English letter she had received,\r\nand to write for her the answer. Before settling to this work, I observed that\r\nshe softly closed the two doors of her chamber; she even shut and fastened the\r\ncasement, though it was a hot day, and free circulation of air was usually\r\nregarded by her as indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an\r\nalmost fierce distrust, suggested such question. Did she want to exclude sound?\r\nwhat sound?\r\n\n\r\nI listened as I had never listened before; I listened like the evening and\r\nwinter-wolf, snuffing the snow, scenting prey, and hearing far off the\r\ntraveller\u2019s tramp. Yet I could both listen and write. About the middle of the\r\nletter I heard\u2014what checked my pen\u2014a tread in the vestibule. No door-bell had\r\nrung; Rosine\u2014acting doubtless by orders\u2014had anticipated such r\u00e9veill\u00e9e. Madame\r\nsaw me halt. She coughed, made a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on\r\nto the classes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProceed,\u201d said Madame; but my hand was fettered, my ear enchained, my thoughts\r\nwere carried off captive.\r\n\n\r\nThe classes formed another building; the hall parted them from the\r\ndwelling-house: despite distance and partition, I heard the sudden stir of\r\nnumbers, a whole division rising at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are putting away work,\u201d said Madame.\r\n\n\r\nIt was indeed the hour to put away work, but why that sudden hush\u2014that instant\r\nquell of the tumult?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWait, Madame\u2014I will see what it is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I put down my pen and left her. Left her? No: she would not be left:\r\npowerless to detain me, she rose and followed, close as my shadow. I turned on\r\nthe last step of the stair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you coming, too?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said she; meeting my glance with a peculiar aspect\u2014a look, clouded, yet\r\nresolute.\r\n\n\r\nWe proceeded then, not together, but she walked in my steps.\r\n\n\r\nHe was come. Entering the first classe, I saw him. There, once more appeared\r\nthe form most familiar. I doubt not they had tried to keep him away, but he was\r\ncome.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls stood in a semicircle; he was passing round, giving his farewells,\r\npressing each hand, touching with his lips each cheek. This last ceremony,\r\nforeign custom permitted at such a parting\u2014so solemn, to last so long.\r\n\n\r\nI felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus; following and watching me\r\nclose; my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her breath; I became terribly\r\ngoaded.\r\n\n\r\nHe was approaching; the semicircle was almost travelled round; he came to the\r\nlast pupil; he turned. But Madame was before me; she had stepped out suddenly;\r\nshe seemed to magnify her proportions and amplify her drapery; she eclipsed me;\r\nI was hid. She knew my weakness and deficiency; she could calculate the degree\r\nof moral paralysis\u2014the total default of self-assertion\u2014with which, in a crisis,\r\nI could be struck. She hastened to her kinsman, she broke upon him volubly, she\r\nmastered his attention, she hurried him to the door\u2014the glass-door opening on\r\nthe garden. I think he looked round; could I but have caught his eye, courage,\r\nI think, would have rushed in to aid feeling, and there would have been a\r\ncharge, and, perhaps, a rescue; but already the room was all confusion, the\r\nsemicircle broken into groups, my figure was lost among thirty more\r\nconspicuous. Madame had her will; yes, she got him away, and he had not seen\r\nme; he thought me absent. Five o\u2019clock struck, the loud dismissal-bell rang,\r\nthe school separated, the room emptied.\r\n\n\r\nThere seems, to my memory, an entire darkness and distraction in some certain\r\nminutes I then passed alone\u2014a grief inexpressible over a loss unendurable.\r\nWhat should I do; oh! what should I do; when all my life\u2019s hope\r\nwas thus torn by the roots out of my riven, outraged heart?\r\n\n\r\nWhat I should have done, I know not, when a little child\u2014the least child\r\nin the school\u2014broke with its simplicity and its unconsciousness into the raging\r\nyet silent centre of that inward conflict.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d lisped the treble voice, \u201cI am to give you that. M. Paul said I\r\nwas to seek you all over the house, from the grenier to the cellar, and when I\r\nfound you, to give you that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the child delivered a note; the little dove dropped on my knee, its olive\r\nleaf plucked off. I found neither address nor name, only these words:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not my intention to take leave of you when I said good-by to the rest,\r\nbut I hoped to see you in classe. I was disappointed. The interview is\r\ndeferred. Be ready for me. Ere I sail, I must see you at leisure, and speak\r\nwith you at length. Be ready; my moments are numbered, and, just now,\r\nmonopolized; besides, I have a private business on hand which I will not share\r\nwith any, nor communicate\u2014even to you.\u2014PAUL.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe ready?\u201d Then it must be this evening: was he not to go on the morrow? Yes;\r\nof that point I was certain. I had seen the date of his vessel\u2019s departure\r\nadvertised. Oh! I would be ready, but could that longed-for meeting\r\nreally be achieved? the time was so short, the schemers seemed so watchful, so\r\nactive, so hostile; the way of access appeared strait as a gully, deep as a\r\nchasm\u2014Apollyon straddled across it, breathing flames. Could my Greatheart\r\novercome? Could my guide reach me?\r\n\n\r\nWho might tell? Yet I began to take some courage, some comfort; it seemed to me\r\nthat I felt a pulse of his heart beating yet true to the whole throb of mine.\r\n\n\r\nI waited my champion. Apollyon came trailing his Hell behind him. I think if\r\nEternity held torment, its form would not be fiery rack, nor its nature\r\ndespair. I think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned,\r\nand will not set, an angel entered Hades\u2014stood, shone, smiled, delivered a\r\nprophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come, not\r\nnow, but at a day and hour unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur\r\nthe height and compass of his promise: spoke thus\u2014then towering, became a star,\r\nand vanished into his own Heaven. His legacy was suspense\u2014a worse boon than\r\ndespair.\r\n\n\r\nAll that evening I waited, trusting in the dove-sent olive-leaf, yet in the\r\nmidst of my trust, terribly fearing. My fear pressed heavy. Cold and peculiar,\r\nI knew it for the partner of a rarely-belied presentiment. The first hours\r\nseemed long and slow; in spirit I clung to the flying skirts of the last. They\r\npassed like drift cloud\u2014like the wrack scudding before a storm.\r\n\n\r\nThey passed. All the long, hot summer day burned away like a Yule-log; the\r\ncrimson of its close perished; I was left bent among the cool blue shades, over\r\nthe pale and ashen gleams of its night.\r\n\n\r\nPrayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates were all retired. I still\r\nremained in the gloomy first classe, forgetting, or at least disregarding,\r\nrules I had never forgotten or disregarded before.\r\n\n\r\nHow long I paced that classe I cannot tell; I must have been afoot many hours;\r\nmechanically had I moved aside benches and desks, and had made for myself a\r\npath down its length. There I walked, and there, when certain that the whole\r\nhousehold were abed, and quite out of hearing\u2014there, I at last wept. Reliant on\r\nNight, confiding in Solitude, I kept my tears sealed, my sobs chained, no\r\nlonger; they heaved my heart; they tore their way. In this house, what grief\r\ncould be sacred?\r\n\n\r\nSoon after eleven o\u2019clock\u2014a very late hour in the Rue Fossette\u2014the door\r\nunclosed, quietly but not stealthily; a lamp\u2019s flame invaded the moonlight;\r\nMadame Beck entered, with the same composed air, as if coming on an ordinary\r\noccasion, at an ordinary season. Instead of at once addressing me, she went to\r\nher desk, took her keys, and seemed to seek something: she loitered over this\r\nfeigned search long, too long. She was calm, too calm; my mood scarce endured\r\nthe pretence; driven beyond common range, two hours since I had left behind me\r\nwonted respects and fears. Led by a touch, and ruled by a word, under usual\r\ncircumstances, no yoke could now be borne\u2014no curb obeyed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is more than time for retirement,\u201d said Madame; \u201cthe rule of the house has\r\nalready been transgressed too long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame met no answer: I did not check my walk; when she came in my way, I put\r\nher out of it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me persuade you to calm, Meess; let me lead you to your chamber,\u201d said\r\nshe, trying to speak softly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I said; \u201cneither you nor another shall persuade or lead me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour bed shall be warmed. Goton is sitting up still. She shall make you\r\ncomfortable: she shall give you a sedative.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame,\u201d I broke out, \u201cyou are a sensualist. Under all your serenity, your\r\npeace, and your decorum, you are an undenied sensualist. Make your own bed warm\r\nand soft; take sedatives and meats, and drinks spiced and sweet, as much as you\r\nwill. If you have any sorrow or disappointment\u2014and, perhaps, you have\u2014nay, I\r\nknow you have\u2014seek your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources.\r\nLeave me, however. Leave me, I say!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must send another to watch you, Meess: I must send Goton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me, and my life, and my\r\ntroubles. Oh, Madame! in your hand there is both chill and poison. You\r\nenvenom and you paralyze.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I done, Meess? You must not marry Paul. He cannot marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDog in the manger!\u201d I said: for I knew she secretly wanted him, and had always\r\nwanted him. She called him \u201cinsupportable:\u201d she railed at him for a \u201cd\u00e9vot:\u201d\r\nshe did not love, but she wanted to marry, that she might bind him to her\r\ninterest. Deep into some of Madame\u2019s secrets I had entered\u2014I know not how: by\r\nan intuition or an inspiration which came to me\u2014I know not whence. In the\r\ncourse of living with her too, I had slowly learned, that, unless with an\r\ninferior, she must ever be a rival. She was my rival, heart and soul,\r\nthough secretly, under the smoothest bearing, and utterly unknown to all save\r\nher and myself.\r\n\n\r\nTwo minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the whole woman was in my power,\r\nbecause in some moods, such as the present\u2014in some stimulated states of\r\nperception, like that of this instant\u2014her habitual disguise, her mask and her\r\ndomino, were to me a mere network reticulated with holes; and I saw underneath\r\na being heartless, self-indulgent, and ignoble. She quietly retreated from me:\r\nmeek and self-possessed, though very uneasy, she said, \u201cIf I would not be\r\npersuaded to take rest, she must reluctantly leave me.\u201d Which she did\r\nincontinent, perhaps even more glad to get away, than I was to see her vanish.\r\n\n\r\nThis was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting, rencontre which ever\r\noccurred between me and Madame Beck: this short night-scene was never repeated.\r\nIt did not one whit change her manner to me. I do not know that she revenged\r\nit. I do not know that she hated me the worse for my fell candour. I think she\r\nbucklered herself with the secret philosophy of her strong mind, and resolved\r\nto forget what it irked her to remember. I know that to the end of our mutual\r\nlives there occurred no repetition of, no allusion to, that fiery passage.\r\n\n\r\nThat night passed: all nights\u2014even the starless night before dissolution\u2014must\r\nwear away. About six o\u2019clock, the hour which called up the household, I went\r\nout to the court, and washed my face in its cold, fresh well-water. Entering by\r\nthe carr\u00e9, a piece of mirror-glass, set in an oaken cabinet, repeated my image.\r\nIt said I was changed: my cheeks and lips were sodden white, my eyes were\r\nglassy, and my eyelids swollen and purple.\r\n\n\r\nOn rejoining my companions, I knew they all looked at me\u2014my heart seemed\r\ndiscovered to them: I believed myself self-betrayed. Hideously certain did it\r\nseem that the very youngest of the school must guess why and for whom I\r\ndespaired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIsabelle,\u201d the child whom I had once nursed in sickness, approached me. Would\r\nshe, too, mock me!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue vous \u00eates p\u00e2le! Vous \u00eates donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!\u201d said she,\r\nputting her finger in her mouth, and staring with a wistful stupidity which at\r\nthe moment seemed to me more beautiful than the keenest intelligence.\r\n\n\r\nIsabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance: before\r\nthe day was over, I gathered cause of gratitude towards the whole blind\r\nhousehold. The multitude have something else to do than to read hearts and\r\ninterpret dark sayings. Who wills, may keep his own counsel\u2014be his own secret\u2019s\r\nsovereign. In the course of that day, proof met me on proof, not only that the\r\ncause of my present sorrow was unguessed, but that my whole inner life for the\r\nlast six months, was still mine only. It was not known\u2014it had not been\r\nnoted\u2014that I held in peculiar value one life among all lives. Gossip had passed\r\nme by; curiosity had looked me over; both subtle influences, hovering always\r\nround, had never become centred upon me. A given organization may live in a\r\nfull fever-hospital, and escape typhus. M. Emanuel had come and gone: I had\r\nbeen taught and sought; in season and out of season he had called me, and I had\r\nobeyed him: \u201cM. Paul wants Miss Lucy\u201d\u2014\u201cMiss Lucy is with M. Paul\u201d\u2014such had been\r\nthe perpetual bulletin; and nobody commented, far less condemned. Nobody\r\nhinted, nobody jested. Madame Beck read the riddle: none else resolved it. What\r\nI now suffered was called illness\u2014a headache: I accepted the baptism.\r\n\n\r\nBut what bodily illness was ever like this pain? This certainty that he was\r\ngone without a farewell\u2014this cruel conviction that fate and pursuing furies\u2014a\r\nwoman\u2019s envy and a priest\u2019s bigotry\u2014would suffer me to see him no more? What\r\nwonder that the second evening found me like the first\u2014untamed, tortured, again\r\npacing a solitary room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation?\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night\u2014she did not come near\r\nme: she sent Ginevra Fanshawe\u2014a more efficient agent for the purpose she could\r\nnot have employed. Ginevra\u2019s first words\u2014\u201cIs your headache very bad to-night?\u201d\r\n(for Ginevra, like the rest, thought I had a headache\u2014an intolerable headache\r\nwhich made me frightfully white in the face, and insanely restless in the\r\nfoot)\u2014her first words, I say, inspired the impulse to flee anywhere, so that it\r\nwere only out of reach. And soon, what followed\u2014plaints about her own\r\nheadaches\u2014completed the business.\r\n\n\r\nI went up-stairs. Presently I was in my bed\u2014my miserable bed\u2014haunted with quick\r\nscorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when another emissary\r\narrived: Goton came, bringing me something to drink. I was consumed with\r\nthirst\u2014I drank eagerly; the beverage was sweet, but I tasted a drug.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou,\u201d said Goton, as she received\r\nback the emptied cup.\r\n\n\r\nAh! the sedative had been administered. In fact, they had given me a strong\r\nopiate. I was to be held quiet for one night.\r\n\n\r\nThe household came to bed, the night-light was lit, the dormitory hushed. Sleep\r\nsoon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy supremacy: contented\r\nsovereign over heads and hearts which did not ache\u2014he passed by the unquiet.\r\n\n\r\nThe drug wrought. I know not whether Madame had overcharged or under-charged\r\nthe dose; its result was not that she intended. Instead of stupor, came\r\nexcitement. I became alive to new thought\u2014to reverie peculiar in colouring. A\r\ngathering call ran among the faculties, their bugles sang, their trumpets rang\r\nan untimely summons. Imagination was roused from her rest, and she came forth\r\nimpetuous and venturous. With scorn she looked on Matter, her mate\u2014\u201cRise!\u201d she\r\nsaid. \u201cSluggard! this night I will have my will; nor shalt thou\r\nprevail.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook forth and view the night!\u201d was her cry; and when I lifted the heavy blind\r\nfrom the casement close at hand\u2014with her own royal gesture, she showed me a\r\nmoon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.\r\n\n\r\nTo my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom, the narrow limits, the\r\noppressive heat of the dormitory, intolerable. She lured me to leave this den\r\nand follow her forth into dew, coolness, and glory.\r\n\n\r\nShe brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at midnight. Especially she\r\nshowed the park, the summer-park, with its long alleys all silent, lone and\r\nsafe; among these lay a huge stone basin\u2014that basin I knew, and beside which I\r\nhad often stood\u2014deep-set in the tree-shadows, brimming with cool water, clear,\r\nwith a green, leafy, rushy bed. What of all this? The park-gates were shut up,\r\nlocked, sentinelled: the place could not be entered.\r\n\n\r\nCould it not? A point worth considering; and while revolving it, I mechanically\r\ndressed. Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying still\u2014excited from head to\r\nfoot\u2014what could I do better than dress?\r\n\n\r\nThe gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no admission\r\nto the park?\r\n\n\r\nThe other day, in walking past, I had seen, without then attending to the\r\ncircumstance, a gap in the paling\u2014one stake broken down: I now saw this gap\r\nagain in recollection\u2014saw it very plainly\u2014the narrow, irregular aperture\r\nvisible between the stems of the lindens, planted orderly as a colonnade. A man\r\ncould not have made his way through that aperture, nor could a stout woman,\r\nperhaps not Madame Beck; but I thought I might: I fancied I should like to try,\r\nand once within, at this hour the whole park would be mine\u2014the moonlight,\r\nmidnight park!\r\n\n\r\nHow soundly the dormitory slept! What deep slumbers! What quiet breathing! How\r\nvery still the whole large house! What was the time? I felt restless to know.\r\nThere stood a clock in the classe below: what hindered me from venturing down\r\nto consult it? By such a moon, its large white face and jet black figures must\r\nbe vividly distinct.\r\n\n\r\nAs for hindrance to this step, there offered not so much as a creaking hinge or\r\na clicking latch. On these hot July nights, close air could not be tolerated,\r\nand the chamber-door stood wide open. Will the dormitory-planks sustain my\r\ntread untraitorous? Yes. I know wherever a board is loose, and will avoid it.\r\nThe oak staircase creaks somewhat as I descend, but not much:\u2014I am in the\r\ncarr\u00e9.\r\n\n\r\nThe great classe-doors are close shut: they are bolted. On the other hand, the\r\nentrance to the corridor stands open. The classes seem to my thought, great\r\ndreary jails, buried far back beyond thoroughfares, and for me, filled with\r\nspectral and intolerable Memories, laid miserable amongst their straw and their\r\nmanacles. The corridor offers a cheerful vista, leading to the high vestibule\r\nwhich opens direct upon the street.\r\n\n\r\nHush!\u2014the clock strikes. Ghostly deep as is the stillness of this convent, it\r\nis only eleven. While my ear follows to silence the hum of the last stroke, I\r\ncatch faintly from the built-out capital, a sound like bells or like a band\u2014a\r\nsound where sweetness, where victory, where mourning blend. Oh, to approach\r\nthis music nearer, to listen to it alone by the rushy basin! Let me go\u2014oh, let\r\nme go! What hinders, what does not aid freedom?\r\n\n\r\nThere, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my large hat, my shawl. There\r\nis no lock on the huge, heavy, porte-coch\u00e8re; there is no key to seek: it\r\nfastens with a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened from the outside, but\r\nwhich, from within, may be noiselessly withdrawn. Can I manage it? It yields to\r\nmy hand, yields with propitious facility. I wonder as that portal seems almost\r\nspontaneously to unclose\u2014I wonder as I cross the threshold and step on the\r\npaved street, wonder at the strange ease with which this prison has been\r\nforced. It seems as if I had been pioneered invisibly, as if some dissolving\r\nforce had gone before me: for myself, I have scarce made an effort.\r\n\n\r\nQuiet Rue Fossette! I find on this pavement that wanderer-wooing summer night\r\nof which I mused; I see its moon over me; I feel its dew in the air. But here I\r\ncannot stay; I am still too near old haunts: so close under the dungeon, I can\r\nhear the prisoners moan. This solemn peace is not what I seek, it is not what I\r\ncan bear: to me the face of that sky bears the aspect of a world\u2019s death. The\r\npark also will be calm\u2014I know, a mortal serenity prevails everywhere\u2014yet let me\r\nseek the park.\r\n\n\r\nI took a route well known, and went up towards the palatial and royal\r\nHaute-Ville; thence the music I had heard certainly floated; it was hushed now,\r\nbut it might re-waken. I went on: neither band nor bell music came to meet me;\r\nanother sound replaced it, a sound like a strong tide, a great flow, deepening\r\nas I proceeded. Light broke, movement gathered, chimes pealed\u2014to what was I\r\ncoming? Entering on the level of a Grande Place, I found myself, with the\r\nsuddenness of magic, plunged amidst a gay, living, joyous crowd.\r\n\n\r\nVillette is one blaze, one broad illumination; the whole world seems abroad;\r\nmoonlight and heaven are banished: the town, by her own flambeaux, beholds her\r\nown splendour\u2014gay dresses, grand equipages, fine horses and gallant riders\r\nthrong the bright streets. I see even scores of masks. It is a strange scene,\r\nstranger than dreams. But where is the park?\u2014I ought to be near it. In the\r\nmidst of this glare the park must be shadowy and calm\u2014there, at least,\r\nare neither torches, lamps, nor crowd?\r\n\n\r\nI was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with known\r\nfaces. Through the deep throng it could pass but slowly; the spirited horses\r\nfretted in their curbed ardour. I saw the occupants of that carriage well: me\r\nthey could not see, or, at least, not know, folded close in my large shawl,\r\nscreened with my straw hat (in that motley crowd no dress was noticeably\r\nstrange). I saw the Count de Bassompierre; I saw my godmother, handsomely\r\napparelled, comely and cheerful; I saw, too, Paulina Mary, compassed with the\r\ntriple halo of her beauty, her youth, and her happiness. In looking on her\r\ncountenance of joy, and eyes of festal light, one scarce remembered to note the\r\ngala elegance of what she wore; I know only that the drapery floating about her\r\nwas all white and light and bridal; seated opposite to her I saw Graham\r\nBretton; it was in looking up at him her aspect had caught its lustre\u2014the light\r\nrepeated in her eyes beamed first out of his.\r\n\n\r\nIt gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly, and I\r\ndid follow them, as I thought, to the park. I watched them alight\r\n(carriages were inadmissible) amidst new and unanticipated splendours. Lo! the\r\niron gateway, between the stone columns, was spanned by a flaming arch built of\r\nmassed stars; and, following them cautiously beneath that arch, where were\r\nthey, and where was I?\r\n\n\r\nIn a land of enchantment, a garden most gorgeous, a plain sprinkled with\r\ncoloured meteors, a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and golden fire\r\ngemming the foliage; a region, not of trees and shadow, but of strangest\r\narchitectural wealth\u2014of altar and of temple, of pyramid, obelisk, and sphinx:\r\nincredible to say, the wonders and the symbols of Egypt teemed throughout the\r\npark of Villette.\r\n\n\r\nNo matter that in five minutes the secret was mine\u2014the key of the mystery\r\npicked up, and its illusion unveiled\u2014no matter that I quickly recognised the\r\nmaterial of these solemn fragments\u2014the timber, the paint, and the\r\npasteboard\u2014these inevitable discoveries failed to quite destroy the charm, or\r\nundermine the marvel of that night. No matter that I now seized the explanation\r\nof the whole great f\u00eate\u2014a f\u00eate of which the conventual Rue Fossette had not\r\ntasted, though it had opened at dawn that morning, and was still in full vigour\r\nnear midnight.\r\n\n\r\nIn past days there had been, said history, an awful crisis in the fate of\r\nLabassecour, involving I know not what peril to the rights and liberties of her\r\ngallant citizens. Rumours of wars there had been, if not wars themselves; a\r\nkind of struggling in the streets\u2014a bustle\u2014a running to and fro, some rearing\r\nof barricades, some burgher-rioting, some calling out of troops, much\r\ninterchange of brickbats, and even a little of shot. Tradition held that\r\npatriots had fallen: in the old Basse-Ville was shown an enclosure, solemnly\r\nbuilt in and set apart, holding, it was said, the sacred bones of martyrs. Be\r\nthis as it may, a certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in\r\nhonour of the said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memory\u2014the\r\nmorning being given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste, the evening\r\ndevoted to spectacles, decorations, and illuminations, such as these I now saw.\r\n\n\r\nWhile looking up at the image of a white ibis, fixed on a column\u2014while\r\nfathoming the deep, torch-lit perspective of an avenue, at the close of which\r\nwas couched a sphinx\u2014I lost sight of the party which, from the middle of the\r\ngreat square, I had followed\u2014or, rather, they vanished like a group of\r\napparitions. On this whole scene was impressed a dream-like character: every\r\nshape was wavering, every movement floating, every voice\r\necho-like\u2014half-mocking, half-uncertain. Paulina and her friends being gone, I\r\nscarce could avouch that I had really seen them; nor did I miss them as guides\r\nthrough the chaos, far less regret them as protectors amidst the night.\r\n\n\r\nThat festal night would have been safe for a very child. Half the peasantry had\r\ncome in from the outlying environs of Villette, and the decent burghers were\r\nall abroad and around, dressed in their best. My straw-hat passed amidst cap\r\nand jacket, short petticoat, and long calico mantle, without, perhaps,\r\nattracting a glance; I only took the precaution to bind down the broad leaf\r\ngipsy-wise, with a supplementary ribbon\u2014and then I felt safe as if masked.\r\n\n\r\nSafe I passed down the avenues\u2014safe I mixed with the crowd where it was\r\ndeepest. To be still was not in my power, nor quietly to observe. I took a\r\nrevel of the scene; I drank the elastic night-air\u2014the swell of sound, the\r\ndubious light, now flashing, now fading. As to Happiness or Hope, they and I\r\nhad shaken hands, but just now\u2014I scorned Despair.\r\n\n\r\nMy vague aim, as I went, was to find the stone-basin, with its clear depth and\r\ngreen lining: of that coolness and verdure I thought, with the passionate\r\nthirst of unconscious fever. Amidst the glare, and hurry, and throng, and\r\nnoise, I still secretly and chiefly longed to come on that circular mirror of\r\ncrystal, and surprise the moon glassing therein her pearly front.\r\n\n\r\nI knew my route, yet it seemed as if I was hindered from pursuing it direct:\r\nnow a sight, and now a sound, called me aside, luring me down this alley and\r\ndown that. Already I saw the thick-planted trees which framed this tremulous\r\nand rippled glass, when, choiring out of a glade to the right, broke such a\r\nsound as I thought might be heard if Heaven were to open\u2014such a sound, perhaps,\r\nas was heard above the plain of Bethlehem, on the night of glad tidings.\r\n\n\r\nThe song, the sweet music, rose afar, but rushing swiftly on fast-strengthening\r\npinions\u2014there swept through these shades so full a storm of harmonies that, had\r\nno tree been near against which to lean, I think I must have dropped. Voices\r\nwere there, it seemed to me, unnumbered; instruments varied and\r\ncountless\u2014bugle, horn, and trumpet I knew. The effect was as a sea breaking\r\ninto song with all its waves.\r\n\n\r\nThe swaying tide swept this way, and then it fell back, and I followed its\r\nretreat. It led me towards a Byzantine building\u2014a sort of kiosk near the park\u2019s\r\ncentre. Round about stood crowded thousands, gathered to a grand concert in the\r\nopen air. What I had heard was, I think, a wild J\u00e4ger chorus; the night, the\r\nspace, the scene, and my own mood, had but enhanced the sounds and their\r\nimpression.\r\n\n\r\nHere were assembled ladies, looking by this light most beautiful: some of their\r\ndresses were gauzy, and some had the sheen of satin, the flowers and the blond\r\ntrembled, and the veils waved about their decorated bonnets, as that host-like\r\nchorus, with its greatly-gathering sound, sundered the air above them. Most of\r\nthese ladies occupied the little light park-chairs, and behind and beside them\r\nstood guardian gentlemen. The outer ranks of the crowd were made up of\r\ncitizens, plebeians and police.\r\n\n\r\nIn this outer rank I took my place. I rather liked to find myself the silent,\r\nunknown, consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short petticoat and the\r\nsabot; and only the distant gazer at the silk robe, the velvet mantle, and the\r\nplumed chapeau. Amidst so much life and joy, too, it suited me to be\r\nalone\u2014quite alone. Having neither wish nor power to force my way through a mass\r\nso close-packed, my station was on the farthest confines, where, indeed, I\r\nmight hear, but could see little.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle is not well placed,\u201d said a voice at my elbow. Who dared accost\r\nme, a being in a mood so little social? I turned, rather to repel than\r\nto reply. I saw a man\u2014a burgher\u2014an entire stranger, as I deemed him for one\r\nmoment, but the next, recognised in him a certain tradesman\u2014a bookseller, whose\r\nshop furnished the Rue Fossette with its books and stationery; a man notorious\r\nin our pensionnat for the excessive brittleness of his temper, and frequent\r\nsnappishness of his manner, even to us, his principal customers: but whom, for\r\nmy solitary self, I had ever been disposed to like, and had always found civil,\r\nsometimes kind; once, in aiding me about some troublesome little exchange of\r\nforeign money, he had done me a service. He was an intelligent man; under his\r\nasperity, he was a good-hearted man; the thought had sometimes crossed me, that\r\na part of his nature bore affinity to a part of M. Emanuel\u2019s (whom he knew\r\nwell, and whom I had often seen sitting on Miret\u2019s counter, turning over the\r\ncurrent month\u2019s publications); and it was in this affinity I read the\r\nexplanation of that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively regarded\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nStrange to say, this man knew me under my straw-hat and closely-folded shawl;\r\nand, though I deprecated the effort, he insisted on making a way for me through\r\nthe crowd, and finding me a better situation. He carried his disinterested\r\ncivility further; and, from some quarter, procured me a chair. Once and again,\r\nI have found that the most cross-grained are by no means the worst of mankind;\r\nnor the humblest in station, the least polished in feeling. This man, in his\r\ncourtesy, seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone; only a reason\r\nfor extending to me, as far as he could, a retiring, yet efficient attention.\r\nHaving secured me a place and a seat, he withdrew without asking a question,\r\nwithout obtruding a remark, without adding a superfluous word. No wonder that\r\nProfessor Emanuel liked to take his cigar and his lounge, and to read his\r\nfeuilleton in M. Miret\u2019s shop\u2014the two must have suited.\r\n\n\r\nI had not been seated five minutes, ere I became aware that chance and my\r\nworthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a familiar and\r\ndomestic group. Right before me sat the Brettons and de Bassompierres. Within\r\nreach of my hand\u2014had I chosen to extend it\u2014sat a figure like a fairy-queen,\r\nwhose array, lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested; whatever was not\r\nspotless white, being forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near, that, had I\r\nleaned forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet. They\r\nwere too near; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger, I felt\r\nuneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance.\r\n\n\r\nIt made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning to Mr. Home, and speaking out\r\nof a kind impulse of memory, said,\u2014\u201cI wonder what my steady little Lucy would\r\nsay to all this if she were here? I wish we had brought her, she would have\r\nenjoyed it much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo she would, so she would, in her grave sensible fashion; it is a pity but we\r\nhad asked her,\u201d rejoined the kind gentleman; and added, \u201cI like to see her so\r\nquietly pleased; so little moved, yet so content.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDear were they both to me, dear are they to this day in their remembered\r\nbenevolence. Little knew they the rack of pain which had driven Lucy almost\r\ninto fever, and brought her out, guideless and reckless, urged and drugged to\r\nthe brink of frenzy. I had half a mind to bend over the elders\u2019 shoulders, and\r\nanswer their goodness with the thanks of my eyes. M. de Bassompierre did not\r\nwell know me, but I knew him, and honoured and admired his\r\nnature, with all its plain sincerity, its warm affection, and unconscious\r\nenthusiasm. Possibly I might have spoken, but just then Graham turned; he\r\nturned with one of his stately firm movements, so different from those, of a\r\nsharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him a throng, a hundred ranks\r\ndeep; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide its scrutiny\u2014why then did\r\nhe concentrate all on me\u2014oppressing me with the whole force of that full, blue,\r\nsteadfast orb? Why, if he would look, did not one glance satisfy him?\r\nwhy did he turn on his chair, rest his elbow on its back, and study me\r\nleisurely? He could not see my face, I held it down; surely, he could\r\nnot recognise me: I stooped, I turned, I would not be known. He rose, by\r\nsome means he contrived to approach, in two minutes he would have had my\r\nsecret: my identity would have been grasped between his, never tyrannous, but\r\nalways powerful hands. There was but one way to evade or to check him. I\r\nimplied, by a sort of supplicatory gesture, that it was my prayer to be let\r\nalone; after that, had he persisted, he would perhaps have seen the spectacle\r\nof Lucy incensed: not all that was grand, or good, or kind in him (and Lucy\r\nfelt the full amount) should have kept her quite tame, or absolutely\r\ninoffensive and shadowlike. He looked, but he desisted. He shook his handsome\r\nhead, but he was mute. He resumed his seat, nor did he again turn or disturb me\r\nby a glance, except indeed for one single instant, when a look, rather\r\nsolicitous than curious, stole my way\u2014speaking what somehow stilled my heart\r\nlike \u201cthe south-wind quieting the earth.\u201d Graham\u2019s thoughts of me were not\r\nentirely those of a frozen indifference, after all. I believe in that goodly\r\nmansion, his heart, he kept one little place under the sky-lights where Lucy\r\nmight have entertainment, if she chose to call. It was not so handsome as the\r\nchambers where he lodged his male friends; it was not like the hall where he\r\naccommodated his philanthropy, or the library where he treasured his science,\r\nstill less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was splendidly\r\nspread; yet, gradually, by long and equal kindness, he proved to me that he\r\nkept one little closet, over the door of which was written \u201cLucy\u2019s Room.\u201d I\r\nkept a place for him, too\u2014a place of which I never took the measure, either by\r\nrule or compass: I think it was like the tent of Peri-Banou. All my life long I\r\ncarried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet, released from that hold and\r\nconstriction, I know not but its innate capacity for expanse might have\r\nmagnified it into a tabernacle for a host.\r\n\n\r\nForbearing as he was to-night, I could not stay in this proximity; this\r\ndangerous place and seat must be given up: I watched my opportunity, rose, and\r\nstole away. He might think, he might even believe that Lucy was contained\r\nwithin that shawl, and sheltered under that hat; he never could be certain, for\r\nhe did not see my face.\r\n\n\r\nSurely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased? Had I not had\r\nenough of adventure? Did I not begin to flag, quail, and wish for safety under\r\na roof? Not so. I still loathed my bed in the school dormitory more than words\r\ncan express: I clung to whatever could distract thought. Somehow I felt, too,\r\nthat the night\u2019s drama was but begun, that the prologue was scarce spoken:\r\nthroughout this woody and turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery; actors and\r\nincidents unlooked-for, waited behind the scenes: I thought so foreboding told\r\nme as much.\r\n\n\r\nStraying at random, obeying the push of every chance elbow, I was brought to a\r\nquarter where trees planted in clusters, or towering singly, broke up somewhat\r\nthe dense packing of the crowd, and gave it a more scattered character. These\r\nconfines were far from the music, and somewhat aloof even from the lamps, but\r\nthere was sound enough to soothe, and with that full, high moon, lamps were\r\nscarce needed. Here had chiefly settled family-groups, burgher-parents; some of\r\nthem, late as was the hour, actually surrounded by their children, with whom it\r\nhad not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng.\r\n\n\r\nThree fine tall trees growing close, almost twined stem within stem, lifted a\r\nthick canopy of shade above a green knoll, crowned with a seat\u2014a seat which\r\nmight have held several, yet it seemed abandoned to one, the remaining members\r\nof the fortunate party in possession of this site standing dutifully round;\r\nyet, amongst this reverend circle was a lady, holding by the hand a little\r\ngirl.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I caught sight of this little girl, she was twisting herself round on her\r\nheel, swinging from her conductress\u2019s hand, flinging herself from side to side\r\nwith wanton and fantastic gyrations. These perverse movements arrested my\r\nattention, they struck me as of a character fearfully familiar. On close\r\ninspection, no less so appeared the child\u2019s equipment; the lilac silk pelisse,\r\nthe small swansdown boa, the white bonnet\u2014the whole holiday toilette, in short,\r\nwas the gala garb of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\r\nBeck\u2014and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Beck it was\u2014she, or an imp in her likeness.\r\n\n\r\nI might have taken this discovery as a thunder-clap, but such hyperbole would\r\nhave been premature; discovery was destined to rise more than one degree, ere\r\nit reached its climax.\r\n\n\r\nOn whose hand could the amiable D\u00e9sir\u00e9e swing thus selfishly, whose glove could\r\nshe tear thus recklessly, whose arm thus strain with impunity, or on the\r\nborders of whose dress thus turn and trample insolently, if not the hand,\r\nglove, arm, and robe of her lady-mother? And there, in an Indian shawl and a\r\npale-green crape bonnet\u2014there, fresh, portly, blithe, and pleasant\u2014there stood\r\nMadame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nCurious! I had certainly deemed Madame in her bed, and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e in her crib, at\r\nthis blessed minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the just, within the\r\nsacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue Fossette. Most certainly\r\nalso they did not picture \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d otherwise engaged; and here we all\r\nthree were taking our \u201c\u00e9bats\u201d in the f\u00eate-blazing park at midnight!\r\n\n\r\nThe fact was, Madame was only acting according to her quite justifiable wont. I\r\nremembered now I had heard it said among the teachers\u2014though without at the\r\ntime particularly noticing the gossip\u2014that often, when we thought Madame in her\r\nchamber, sleeping, she was gone, full-dressed, to take her pleasure at operas,\r\nor plays, or balls. Madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life, and took\r\ncare\u2014largely, though discreetly\u2014to season her existence with a relish of the\r\nworld.\r\n\n\r\nHalf a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about her. Amongst these, I was not\r\nslow to recognise two or three. There was her brother, M. Victor Kint; there\r\nwas another person, moustached and with long hair\u2014a calm, taciturn man, but\r\nwhose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I could not mark unmoved. Amidst\r\nreserve and phlegm, amidst contrasts of character and of countenance, something\r\nthere still was which recalled a face\u2014mobile, fervent, feeling\u2014a face\r\nchangeable, now clouded, and now alight\u2014a face from my world taken away, for my\r\neyes lost, but where my best spring-hours of life had alternated in shadow and\r\nin glow; that face, where I had often seen movements so near the signs of\r\ngenius\u2014that why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire, the thing,\r\nthe spirit, and the secret itself\u2014I could never tell. Yes\u2014this Josef\r\nEmanuel\u2014this man of peace\u2014reminded me of his ardent brother.\r\n\n\r\nBesides Messieurs Victor and Josef, I knew another of this party. This third\r\nperson stood behind and in the shade, his attitude too was stooping, yet his\r\ndress and bald white head made him the most conspicuous figure of the group. He\r\nwas an ecclesiastic: he was P\u00e8re Silas. Do not fancy, reader, that there was\r\nany inconsistency in the priest\u2019s presence at this f\u00eate. This was not\r\nconsidered a show of Vanity Fair, but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice.\r\nThe Church patronised it, even with ostentation. There were troops of priests\r\nin the park that night.\r\n\n\r\nP\u00e8re Silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant, the rustic bench and\r\nthat which sat upon it: a strange mass it was\u2014bearing no shape, yet\r\nmagnificent. You saw, indeed, the outline of a face, and features, but these\r\nwere so cadaverous and so strangely placed, you could almost have fancied a\r\nhead severed from its trunk, and flung at random on a pile of rich merchandise.\r\nThe distant lamp-rays glanced on clear pendants, on broad rings; neither the\r\nchasteness of moonlight, nor the distance of the torches, could quite subdue\r\nthe gorgeous dyes of the drapery. Hail, Madame Walravens! I think you looked\r\nmore witch-like than ever. And presently the good lady proved that she was\r\nindeed no corpse or ghost, but a harsh and hardy old woman; for, upon some\r\naggravation in the clamorous petition of D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Beck to her mother, to go to\r\nthe kiosk and take sweetmeats, the hunchback suddenly fetched her a resounding\r\nrap with her gold-knobbed cane.\r\n\n\r\nThere, then, were Madame Walravens, Madame Beck, P\u00e8re Silas\u2014the whole\r\nconjuration, the secret junta. The sight of them thus assembled did me good. I\r\ncannot say that I felt weak before them, or abashed, or dismayed. They\r\noutnumbered me, and I was worsted and under their feet; but, as yet, I was not\r\ndead.\r\n\n"}
{"40": "\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nOLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE.\n\r\nFascinated as by a basilisk with three heads, I could not leave this clique;\r\nthe ground near them seemed to hold my feet. The canopy of entwined trees held\r\nout shadow, the night whispered a pledge of protection, and an officious lamp\r\nflashed just one beam to show me an obscure, safe seat, and then vanished. Let\r\nme now briefly tell the reader all that, during the past dark fortnight, I have\r\nbeen silently gathering from Rumour, respecting the origin and the object of M.\r\nEmanuel\u2019s departure. The tale is short, and not new: its alpha is Mammon, and\r\nits omega Interest.\r\n\n\r\nIf Madame Walravens was hideous as a Hindoo idol, she seemed also to possess,\r\nin the estimation of these her votaries, an idol\u2019s consequence. The fact was,\r\nshe had been rich\u2014very rich; and though, for the present, without the command\r\nof money, she was likely one day to be rich again. At Basseterre, in\r\nGuadaloupe, she possessed a large estate, received in dowry on her marriage\r\nsixty years ago, sequestered since her husband\u2019s failure; but now, it was\r\nsupposed, cleared of claim, and, if duly looked after by a competent agent of\r\nintegrity, considered capable of being made, in a few years, largely\r\nproductive.\r\n\n\r\nP\u00e8re Silas took an interest in this prospective improvement for the sake of\r\nreligion and the church, whereof Magliore Walravens was a devout daughter.\r\nMadame Beck, distantly related to the hunchback and knowing her to be without\r\nfamily of her own, had long brooded over contingencies with a mother\u2019s\r\ncalculating forethought, and, harshly treated as she was by Madame Walravens,\r\nnever ceased to court her for interest\u2019s sake. Madame Beck and the priest were\r\nthus, for money reasons, equally and sincerely interested in the nursing of the\r\nWest Indian estate.\r\n\n\r\nBut the distance was great, and the climate hazardous. The competent and\r\nupright agent wanted, must be a devoted man. Just such a man had Madame\r\nWalravens retained for twenty years in her service, blighting his life, and\r\nthen living on him, like an old fungus; such a man had P\u00e8re Silas trained,\r\ntaught, and bound to him by the ties of gratitude, habit, and belief. Such a\r\nman Madame Beck knew, and could in some measure influence. \u201cMy pupil,\u201d said\r\nP\u00e8re Silas, \u201cif he remains in Europe, runs risk of apostacy, for he has become\r\nentangled with a heretic.\u201d Madame Beck made also her private comment, and\r\npreferred in her own breast her secret reason for desiring expatriation. The\r\nthing she could not obtain, she desired not another to win: rather would she\r\ndestroy it. As to Madame Walravens, she wanted her money and her land, and knew\r\nPaul, if he liked, could make the best and faithfullest steward: so the three\r\nself-seekers banded and beset the one unselfish. They reasoned, they appealed,\r\nthey implored; on his mercy they cast themselves, into his hands they\r\nconfidingly thrust their interests. They asked but two or three years of\r\ndevotion\u2014after that, he should live for himself: one of the number, perhaps,\r\nwished that in the meantime he might die.\r\n\n\r\nNo living being ever humbly laid his advantage at M. Emanuel\u2019s feet, or\r\nconfidingly put it into his hands, that he spurned the trust or repulsed the\r\nrepository. What might be his private pain or inward reluctance to leave\r\nEurope\u2014what his calculations for his own future\u2014none asked, or knew, or\r\nreported. All this was a blank to me. His conferences with his confessor I\r\nmight guess; the part duty and religion were made to play in the persuasions\r\nused, I might conjecture. He was gone, and had made no sign. There my knowledge\r\nclosed.\r\n\n\r\nWith my head bent, and my forehead resting on my hands, I sat amidst grouped\r\ntree-stems and branching brushwood. Whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours,\r\nI might hear, if I would; I was near enough; but for some time, there was\r\nscarce motive to attend. They gossiped about the dresses, the music, the\r\nilluminations, the fine night. I listened to hear them say, \u201cIt is calm weather\r\nfor his voyage; the Antigua\u201d (his ship) \u201cwill sail prosperously.\u201d\r\nNo such remark fell; neither the Antigua, nor her course, nor her\r\npassenger were named.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps the light chat scarcely interested old Madame Walravens more than it\r\ndid me; she appeared restless, turning her head now to this side, now that,\r\nlooking through the trees, and among the crowd, as if expectant of an arrival\r\nand impatient of delay. \u201cO\u00f9 sont-ils? Pourquoi ne viennent-ils?\u201d I heard her\r\nmutter more than once; and at last, as if determined to have an answer to her\r\nquestion\u2014which hitherto none seemed to mind, she spoke aloud this phrase\u2014a\r\nphrase brief enough, simple enough, but it sent a shock through me\u2014\u201cMessieurs\r\net mesdames,\u201d said she, \u201co\u00f9 donc est Justine Marie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie!\u201d What was this? Justine Marie\u2014the dead nun\u2014where was she? Why,\r\nin her grave, Madame Walravens\u2014what can you want with her? You shall go to her,\r\nbut she shall not come to you.\r\n\n\r\nThus I should have answered, had the response lain with me, but nobody\r\nseemed to be of my mind; nobody seemed surprised, startled, or at a loss. The\r\nquietest commonplace answer met the strange, the dead-disturbing, the\r\nWitch-of-Endor query of the hunchback.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie,\u201d said one, \u201cis coming; she is in the kiosk; she will be here\r\npresently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOut of this question and reply sprang a change in the chat\u2014chat it still\r\nremained, easy, desultory, familiar gossip. Hint, allusion, comment, went round\r\nthe circle, but all so broken, so dependent on references to persons not named,\r\nor circumstances not defined, that listen as intently as I would\u2014and I\r\ndid listen now with a fated interest\u2014I could make out no more\r\nthan that some scheme was on foot, in which this ghostly Justine Marie\u2014dead or\r\nalive\u2014was concerned. This family-junta seemed grasping at her somehow, for some\r\nreason; there seemed question of a marriage, of a fortune\u2014for whom I could not\r\nquite make out\u2014perhaps for Victor Kint, perhaps for Josef Emanuel\u2014both were\r\nbachelors. Once I thought the hints and jests rained upon a young fair-haired\r\nforeigner of the party, whom they called Heinrich M\u00fchler. Amidst all the\r\nbadinage, Madame Walravens still obtruded from time to time, hoarse,\r\ncross-grained speeches; her impatience being diverted only by an implacable\r\nsurveillance of D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, who could not stir but the old woman menaced her with\r\nher staff.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLa voil\u00e0!\u201d suddenly cried one of the gentlemen, \u201cvoil\u00e0 Justine Marie qui\r\narrive!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis moment was for me peculiar. I called up to memory the pictured nun on the\r\npanel; present to my mind was the sad love-story; I saw in thought the vision\r\nof the garret, the apparition of the alley, the strange birth of the berceau; I\r\nunderwent a presentiment of discovery, a strong conviction of coming\r\ndisclosure. Ah! when imagination once runs riot where do we stop? What winter\r\ntree so bare and branchless\u2014what way-side, hedge-munching animal so humble,\r\nthat Fancy, a passing cloud, and a struggling moonbeam, will not clothe it in\r\nspirituality, and make of it a phantom?\r\n\n\r\nWith solemn force pressed on my heart, the expectation of mystery breaking up:\r\nhitherto I had seen this spectre only through a glass darkly; now was I to\r\nbehold it face to face. I leaned forward; I looked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe comes!\u201d cried Josef Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nThe circle opened as if opening to admit a new and welcome member. At this\r\ninstant a torch chanced to be carried past; its blaze aided the pale moon in\r\ndoing justice to the crisis, in lighting to perfection the d\u00e9nouement pressing\r\non. Surely those near me must have felt some little of the anxiety I felt, in\r\ndegree so unmeted. Of that group the coolest must have \u201cheld his breath for a\r\ntime!\u201d As for me, my life stood still.\r\n\n\r\nIt is over. The moment and the nun are come. The crisis and the revelation are\r\npassed by.\r\n\n\r\nThe flambeau glares still within a yard, held up in a park-keeper\u2019s hand; its\r\nlong eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of the Expected\u2014there\u2014where\r\nshe stands full in my sight. What is she like? What does she wear? How does she\r\nlook? Who is she?\r\n\n\r\nThere are many masks in the park to-night, and as the hour wears late, so\r\nstrange a feeling of revelry and mystery begins to spread abroad, that scarce\r\nwould you discredit me, reader, were I to say that she is like the nun of the\r\nattic, that she wears black skirts and white head-clothes, that she looks the\r\nresurrection of the flesh, and that she is a risen ghost.\r\n\n\r\nAll falsities\u2014all figments! We will not deal in this gear. Let us be honest,\r\nand cut, as heretofore, from the homely web of truth.\r\n\n\nHomely, though, is an ill-chosen word. What I see is not precisely\r\nhomely. A girl of Villette stands there\u2014a girl fresh from her pensionnat. She\r\nis very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this country. She looks\r\nwell-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her cheeks are round, her eyes good;\r\nher hair is abundant. She is handsomely dressed. She is not alone; her escort\r\nconsists of three persons\u2014two being elderly; these she addresses as \u201cMon Oncle\u201d\r\nand \u201cMa Tante.\u201d She laughs, she chats; good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she\r\nlooks, at all points, the bourgeoise belle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Justine Marie;\u201d so much for ghosts and mystery: not that this last\r\nwas solved\u2014this girl certainly is not my nun: what I saw in the garret and\r\ngarden must have been taller by a span.\r\n\n\r\nWe have looked at the city belle; we have cursorily glanced at the respectable\r\nold uncle and aunt. Have we a stray glance to give to the third member of this\r\ncompany? Can we spare him a moment\u2019s notice? We ought to distinguish him so\r\nfar, reader; he has claims on us; we do not now meet him for the first time. I\r\nclasped my hands very hard, and I drew my breath very deep: I held in the cry,\r\nI devoured the ejaculation, I forbade the start, I spoke and I stirred no more\r\nthan a stone; but I knew what I looked on; through the dimness left in my eyes\r\nby many nights\u2019 weeping, I knew him. They said he was to sail by the\r\nAntigua. Madame Beck said so. She lied, or she had uttered what was once\r\ntruth, and failed to contradict it when it became false. The Antigua was\r\ngone, and there stood Paul Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nWas I glad? A huge load left me. Was it a fact to warrant joy? I know not. Ask\r\nfirst what were the circumstances attendant on this respite? How far did this\r\ndelay concern me? Were there not those whom it might touch more nearly?\r\n\n\r\nAfter all, who may this young girl, this Justine Marie, be? Not a stranger,\r\nreader; she is known to me by sight; she visits at the Rue Fossette: she is\r\noften of Madame Beck\u2019s Sunday parties. She is a relation of both the Becks and\r\nWalravens; she derives her baptismal name from the sainted nun who would have\r\nbeen her aunt had she lived; her patronymic is Sauveur; she is an heiress and\r\nan orphan, and M. Emanuel is her guardian; some say her godfather.\r\n\n\r\nThe family junta wish this heiress to be married to one of their band\u2014which is\r\nit? Vital question\u2014which is it?\r\n\n\r\nI felt very glad now, that the drug administered in the sweet draught had\r\nfilled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable. I always,\r\nthrough my whole life, liked to penetrate to the real truth; I like seeking the\r\ngoddess in her temple, and handling the veil, and daring the dread glance. O\r\nTitaness among deities! the covered outline of thine aspect sickens often\r\nthrough its uncertainty, but define to us one trait, show us one lineament,\r\nclear in awful sincerity; we may gasp in untold terror, but with that gasp we\r\ndrink in a breath of thy divinity; our heart shakes, and its currents sway like\r\nrivers lifted by earthquake, but we have swallowed strength. To see and know\r\nthe worst is to take from Fear her main advantage.\r\n\n\r\nThe Walravens\u2019 party, augmented in numbers, now became very gay. The gentlemen\r\nfetched refreshments from the kiosk, all sat down on the turf under the trees;\r\nthey drank healths and sentiments; they laughed, they jested. M. Emanuel\r\nunderwent some raillery, half good-humoured, half, I thought, malicious,\r\nespecially on Madame Beck\u2019s part. I soon gathered that his voyage had been\r\ntemporarily deferred of his own will, without the concurrence, even against the\r\nadvice, of his friends; he had let the Antigua go, and had taken his\r\nberth in the Paul et Virginie, appointed to sail a fortnight later. It\r\nwas his reason for this resolve which they teased him to assign, and which he\r\nwould only vaguely indicate as \u201cthe settlement of a little piece of business\r\nwhich he had set his heart upon.\u201d What was this business? Nobody knew.\r\nYes, there was one who seemed partly, at least, in his confidence; a meaning\r\nlook passed between him and Justine Marie. \u201cLa petite va m\u2019aider\u2014n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\nsaid he. The answer was prompt enough, God knows!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais oui, je vous aiderai de tout mon c\u0153ur. Vous ferez de moi tout ce que\r\nvous voudrez, mon parrain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd this dear \u201cparrain\u201d took her hand and lifted it to his grateful lips. Upon\r\nwhich demonstration, I saw the light-complexioned young Teuton, Heinrich\r\nM\u00fchler, grow restless, as if he did not like it. He even grumbled a few words,\r\nwhereat M. Emanuel actually laughed in his face, and with the ruthless triumph\r\nof the assured conqueror, he drew his ward nearer to him.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was indeed very joyous that night. He seemed not one whit subdued by\r\nthe change of scene and action impending. He was the true life of the party; a\r\nlittle despotic, perhaps, determined to be chief in mirth, as well as in\r\nlabour, yet from moment to moment proving indisputably his right of leadership.\r\nHis was the wittiest word, the pleasantest anecdote, the frankest laugh.\r\nRestlessly active, after his manner, he multiplied himself to wait on all; but\r\noh! I saw which was his favourite. I saw at whose feet he lay on the turf, I\r\nsaw whom he folded carefully from the night air, whom he tended, watched, and\r\ncherished as the apple of his eye.\r\n\n\r\nStill, hint and raillery flew thick, and still I gathered that while M. Paul\r\nshould be absent, working for others, these others, not quite ungrateful, would\r\nguard for him the treasure he left in Europe. Let him bring them an Indian\r\nfortune: they would give him in return a young bride and a rich inheritance. As\r\nfor the saintly consecration, the vow of constancy, that was forgotten: the\r\nblooming and charming Present prevailed over the Past; and, at length, his nun\r\nwas indeed buried.\r\n\n\r\nThus it must be. The revelation was indeed come. Presentiment had not been\r\nmistaken in her impulse: there is a kind of presentiment which never is\r\nmistaken; it was I who had for a moment miscalculated; not seeing the true\r\nbearing of the oracle, I had thought she muttered of vision when, in truth, her\r\nprediction touched reality.\r\n\n\r\nI might have paused longer upon what I saw; I might have deliberated ere I drew\r\ninferences. Some, perhaps, would have held the premises doubtful, the proofs\r\ninsufficient; some slow sceptics would have incredulously examined ere they\r\nconclusively accepted the project of a marriage between a poor and unselfish\r\nman of forty, and his wealthy ward of eighteen; but far from me such shifts and\r\npalliatives, far from me such temporary evasion of the actual, such coward\r\nfleeing from the dread, the swift-footed, the all-overtaking Fact, such feeble\r\nsuspense of submission to her the sole sovereign, such paltering and faltering\r\nresistance to the Power whose errand is to march conquering and to conquer,\r\nsuch traitor defection from the TRUTH.\r\n\n\r\nNo. I hastened to accept the whole plan. I extended my grasp and took it all\r\nin. I gathered it to me with a sort of rage of haste, and folded it round me,\r\nas the soldier struck on the field folds his colours about his breast. I\r\ninvoked Conviction to nail upon me the certainty, abhorred while embraced, to\r\nfix it with the strongest spikes her strongest strokes could drive; and when\r\nthe iron had entered well my soul, I stood up, as I thought, renovated.\r\n\n\r\nIn my infatuation, I said, \u201cTruth, you are a good mistress to your faithful\r\nservants! While a Lie pressed me, how I suffered! Even when the Falsehood was\r\nstill sweet, still flattering to the fancy, and warm to the feelings, it wasted\r\nme with hourly torment. The persuasion that affection was won could not be\r\ndivorced from the dread that, by another turn of the wheel, it might be lost.\r\nTruth stripped away Falsehood, and Flattery, and Expectancy, and here I\r\nstand\u2014free!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNothing remained now but to take my freedom to my chamber, to carry it with me\r\nto my bed and see what I could make of it. The play was not yet, indeed, quite\r\nplayed out. I might have waited and watched longer that love-scene under the\r\ntrees, that sylvan courtship. Had there been nothing of love in the\r\ndemonstration, my Fancy in this hour was so generous, so creative, she could\r\nhave modelled for it the most salient lineaments, and given it the deepest life\r\nand highest colour of passion. But I would not look; I had fixed my\r\nresolve, but I would not violate my nature. And then\u2014something tore me so\r\ncruelly under my shawl, something so dug into my side, a vulture so strong in\r\nbeak and talon, I must be alone to grapple with it. I think I never felt\r\njealousy till now. This was not like enduring the endearments of Dr. John and\r\nPaulina, against which while I sealed my eyes and my ears, while I withdrew\r\nthence my thoughts, my sense of harmony still acknowledged in it a charm. This\r\nwas an outrage. The love born of beauty was not mine; I had nothing in common\r\nwith it: I could not dare to meddle with it, but another love, venturing\r\ndiffidently into life after long acquaintance, furnace-tried by pain, stamped\r\nby constancy, consolidated by affection\u2019s pure and durable alloy, submitted by\r\nintellect to intellect\u2019s own tests, and finally wrought up, by his own process,\r\nto his own unflawed completeness, this Love that laughed at Passion, his fast\r\nfrenzies and his hot and hurried extinction, in this Love I had a vested\r\ninterest; and whatever tended either to its culture or its destruction, I could\r\nnot view impassibly.\r\n\n\r\nI turned from the group of trees and the \u201cmerrie companie\u201d in its shade.\r\nMidnight was long past; the concert was over, the crowds were thinning. I\r\nfollowed the ebb. Leaving the radiant park and well-lit Haute-Ville (still well\r\nlit, this it seems was to be a \u201cnuit blanche\u201d in Villette), I sought the dim\r\nlower quarter.\r\n\n\r\nDim I should not say, for the beauty of moonlight\u2014forgotten in the park\u2014here\r\nonce more flowed in upon perception. High she rode, and calm and stainlessly\r\nshe shone. The music and the mirth of the f\u00eate, the fire and bright hues of\r\nthose lamps had out-done and out-shone her for an hour, but now, again, her\r\nglory and her silence triumphed. The rival lamps were dying: she held her\r\ncourse like a white fate. Drum, trumpet, bugle, had uttered their clangour, and\r\nwere forgotten; with pencil-ray she wrote on heaven and on earth records for\r\narchives everlasting. She and those stars seemed to me at once the types and\r\nwitnesses of truth all regnant. The night-sky lit her reign: like its\r\nslow-wheeling progress, advanced her victory\u2014that onward movement which has\r\nbeen, and is, and will be from eternity to eternity.\r\n\n\r\nThese oil-twinkling streets are very still: I like them for their lowliness and\r\npeace. Homeward-bound burghers pass me now and then, but these companies are\r\npedestrians, make little noise, and are soon gone. So well do I love Villette\r\nunder her present aspect, not willingly would I re-enter under a roof, but that\r\nI am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful close, and quietly\r\nregaining my bed in the great dormitory, before Madame Beck comes home.\r\n\n\r\nOnly one street lies between me and the Rue Fossette; as I enter it, for the\r\nfirst time, the sound of a carriage tears up the deep peace of this quarter. It\r\ncomes this way\u2014comes very fast. How loud sounds its rattle on the paved path!\r\nThe street is narrow, and I keep carefully to the causeway. The carriage\r\nthunders past, but what do I see, or fancy I see, as it rushes by? Surely\r\nsomething white fluttered from that window\u2014surely a hand waved a handkerchief.\r\nWas that signal meant for me? Am I known? Who could recognise me? That is not\r\nM. de Bassompierre\u2019s carriage, nor Mrs. Bretton\u2019s; and besides, neither the\r\nH\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy nor the ch\u00e2teau of La Terrasse lies in that direction. Well, I have\r\nno time for conjecture; I must hurry home.\r\n\n\r\nGaining the Rue Fossette, reaching the pensionnat, all there was still; no\r\nfiacre had yet arrived with Madame and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. I had left the great door ajar;\r\nshould I find it thus? Perhaps the wind or some other accident may have thrown\r\nit to with sufficient force to start the spring-bolt? In that case, hopeless\r\nbecame admission; my adventure must issue in catastrophe. I lightly pushed the\r\nheavy leaf; would it yield?\r\n\n\r\nYes. As soundless, as unresisting, as if some propitious genius had waited on a\r\nsesame-charm, in the vestibule within. Entering with bated breath, quietly\r\nmaking all fast, shoelessly mounting the staircase, I sought the dormitory, and\r\nreached my couch.\r\n\n\r\nAy! I reached it, and once more drew a free inspiration. The next moment, I\r\nalmost shrieked\u2014almost, but not quite, thank Heaven!\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the dormitory, throughout the house, there reigned at this hour the\r\nstillness of death. All slept, and in such hush, it seemed that none dreamed.\r\nStretched on the nineteen beds lay nineteen forms, at full-length and\r\nmotionless. On mine\u2014the twentieth couch\u2014nothing ought to have lain: I\r\nhad left it void, and void should have found it. What, then; do I see between\r\nthe half-drawn curtains? What dark, usurping shape, supine, long, and strange?\r\nIs it a robber who has made his way through the open street-door, and lies\r\nthere in wait? It looks very black, I think it looks\u2014not human. Can it be a\r\nwandering dog that has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither?\r\nWill it spring, will it leap out if I approach? Approach I must. Courage! One\r\nstep!\u2014\r\n\n\r\nMy head reeled, for by the faint night-lamp, I saw stretched on my bed the old\r\nphantom\u2014the NUN.\r\n\n\r\nA cry at this moment might have ruined me. Be the spectacle what it might, I\r\ncould afford neither consternation, scream, nor swoon. Besides, I was not\r\novercome. Tempered by late incidents, my nerves disdained hysteria. Warm from\r\nilluminations, and music, and thronging thousands, thoroughly lashed up by a\r\nnew scourge, I defied spectra. In a moment, without exclamation, I had rushed\r\non the haunted couch; nothing leaped out, or sprung, or stirred; all the\r\nmovement was mine, so was all the life, the reality, the substance, the force;\r\nas my instinct felt. I tore her up\u2014the incubus! I held her on high\u2014the goblin!\r\nI shook her loose\u2014the mystery! And down she fell\u2014down all around me\u2014down in\r\nshreds and fragments\u2014and I trode upon her.\r\n\n\r\nHere again\u2014behold the branchless tree, the unstabled Rosinante; the film of\r\ncloud, the flicker of moonshine. The long nun proved a long bolster dressed in\r\na long black stole, and artfully invested with a white veil. The garments in\r\nvery truth, strange as it may seem, were genuine nun\u2019s garments, and by some\r\nhand they had been disposed with a view to illusion. Whence came these\r\nvestments? Who contrived this artifice? These questions still remained. To the\r\nhead-bandage was pinned a slip of paper: it bore in pencil these mocking words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe nun of the attic bequeaths to Lucy Snowe her wardrobe. She will be seen in\r\nthe Rue Fossette no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd what and who was she that had haunted me? She, I had actually seen three\r\ntimes. Not a woman of my acquaintance had the stature of that ghost. She was\r\nnot of a female height. Not to any man I knew could the machination, for a\r\nmoment, be attributed.\r\n\n\r\nStill mystified beyond expression, but as thoroughly, as suddenly, relieved\r\nfrom all sense of the spectral and unearthly; scorning also to wear out my\r\nbrain with the fret of a trivial though insoluble riddle, I just bundled\r\ntogether stole, veil, and bandages, thrust them beneath my pillow, lay down,\r\nlistened till I heard the wheels of Madame\u2019s home-returning fiacre, then\r\nturned, and worn out by many nights\u2019 vigils, conquered, too, perhaps, by the\r\nnow reacting narcotic, I deeply slept.\r\n\n"}
{"41": "\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nTHE HAPPY PAIR.\n\r\nThe day succeeding this remarkable Midsummer night, proved no common day. I do\r\nnot mean that it brought signs in heaven above, or portents on the earth\r\nbeneath; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena, to storm, flood, or\r\nwhirlwind. On the contrary: the sun rose jocund, with a July face. Morning\r\ndecked her beauty with rubies, and so filled her lap with roses, that they fell\r\nfrom her in showers, making her path blush: the Hours woke fresh as nymphs, and\r\nemptying on the early hills their dew-vials, they stepped out dismantled of\r\nvapour: shadowless, azure, and glorious, they led the sun\u2019s steeds on a burning\r\nand unclouded course.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, it was as fine a day as the finest summer could boast; but I doubt\r\nwhether I was not the sole inhabitant of the Rue Fossette, who cared or\r\nremembered to note this pleasant fact. Another thought busied all other heads;\r\na thought, indeed, which had its share in my meditations; but this master\r\nconsideration, not possessing for me so entire a novelty, so overwhelming a\r\nsuddenness, especially so dense a mystery, as it offered to the majority of my\r\nco-speculators thereon, left me somewhat more open than the rest to any\r\ncollateral observation or impression.\r\n\n\r\nStill, while walking in the garden, feeling the sunshine, and marking the\r\nblooming and growing plants, I pondered the same subject the whole house\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\n\r\nWhat subject?\r\n\n\r\nMerely this. When matins came to be said, there was a place vacant in the first\r\nrank of boarders. When breakfast was served, there remained a coffee-cup\r\nunclaimed. When the housemaid made the beds, she found in one, a bolster laid\r\nlengthwise, clad in a cap and night-gown; and when Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s\r\nmusic-mistress came early, as usual, to give the morning lesson, that\r\naccomplished and promising young person, her pupil, failed utterly to be\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\n\r\nHigh and low was Miss Fanshawe sought; through length and breadth was the house\r\nransacked; vainly; not a trace, not an indication, not so much as a scrap of a\r\nbillet rewarded the search; the nymph was vanished, engulfed in the past night,\r\nlike a shooting star swallowed up by darkness.\r\n\n\r\nDeep was the dismay of surveillante teachers, deeper the horror of the\r\ndefaulting directress. Never had I seen Madame Beck so pale or so appalled.\r\nHere was a blow struck at her tender part, her weak side; here was damage done\r\nto her interest. How, too, had the untoward event happened? By what outlet had\r\nthe fugitive taken wing? Not a casement was found unfastened, not a pane of\r\nglass broken; all the doors were bolted secure. Never to this day has Madame\r\nBeck obtained satisfaction on this point, nor indeed has anybody else\r\nconcerned, save and excepting one, Lucy Snowe, who could not forget how, to\r\nfacilitate a certain enterprise, a certain great door had been drawn softly to\r\nits lintel, closed, indeed, but neither bolted nor secure. The thundering\r\ncarriage-and-pair encountered were now likewise recalled, as well as that\r\npuzzling signal, the waved handkerchief.\r\n\n\r\nFrom these premises, and one or two others, inaccessible to any but myself, I\r\ncould draw but one inference. It was a case of elopement. Morally certain on\r\nthis head, and seeing Madame Beck\u2019s profound embarrassment, I at last\r\ncommunicated my conviction. Having alluded to M. de Hamal\u2019s suit, I found, as I\r\nexpected, that Madame Beck was perfectly au fait to that affair. She had long\r\nsince discussed it with Mrs. Cholmondeley, and laid her own responsibility in\r\nthe business on that lady\u2019s shoulders. To Mrs. Cholmondeley and M. de\r\nBassompierre she now had recourse.\r\n\n\r\nWe found that the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy was already alive to what had happened. Ginevra\r\nhad written to her cousin Paulina, vaguely signifying hymeneal intentions;\r\ncommunications had been received from the family of de Hamal; M. de\r\nBassompierre was on the track of the fugitives. He overtook them too late.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the week, the post brought me a note. I may as well transcribe\r\nit; it contains explanation on more than one point:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u2018DEAR OLD TIM \u201c(short for Timon),\u2014\u201d I am off you see\u2014gone like a shot. Alfred\r\nand I intended to be married in this way almost from the first; we never meant\r\nto be spliced in the humdrum way of other people; Alfred has too much spirit\r\nfor that, and so have I\u2014Dieu merci! Do you know, Alfred, who used to call you\r\n\u2018the dragon,\u2019 has seen so much of you during the last few months, that he\r\nbegins to feel quite friendly towards you. He hopes you won\u2019t miss him now that\r\nhe has gone; he begs to apologize for any little trouble he may have given you.\r\nHe is afraid he rather inconvenienced you once when he came upon you in the\r\ngrenier, just as you were reading a letter seemingly of the most special\r\ninterest; but he could not resist the temptation to give you a start, you\r\nappeared so wonderfully taken up with your correspondent. En revanche, he says\r\nyou once frightened him by rushing in for a dress or a shawl, or some other\r\nchiffon, at the moment when he had struck a light, and was going to take a\r\nquiet whiff of his cigar, while waiting for me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you begin to comprehend by this time that M. le Comte de Hamal was the nun\r\nof the attic, and that he came to see your humble servant? I will tell you how\r\nhe managed it. You know he has the entr\u00e9e of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, where two or three of\r\nhis nephews, the sons of his eldest sister, Madame de Melcy, are students. You\r\nknow the court of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e is on the other side of the high wall bounding\r\nyour walk, the all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue. Alfred can climb as well as he can dance or\r\nfence: his amusement was to make the escalade of our pensionnat by mounting,\r\nfirst the wall; then\u2014by the aid of that high tree overspreading the grand\r\nberceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the lower buildings of\r\nour premises\u2014he managed to scale the first classe and the grand salle. One\r\nnight, by the way, he fell out of this tree, tore down some of the branches,\r\nnearly broke his own neck, and after all, in running away, got a terrible\r\nfright, and was nearly caught by two people, Madame Beck and M. Emanuel, he\r\nthinks, walking in the alley. From the grande salle the ascent is not difficult\r\nto the highest block of building, finishing in the great garret. The skylight,\r\nyou know, is, day and night, left half open for air; by the skylight he\r\nentered. Nearly a year ago I chanced to tell him our legend of the nun; that\r\nsuggested his romantic idea of the spectral disguise, which I think you must\r\nallow he has very cleverly carried out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut for the nun\u2019s black gown and white veil, he would have been caught again\r\nand again both by you and that tiger-Jesuit, M. Paul. He thinks you both\r\ncapital ghost-seers, and very brave. What I wonder at is, rather your\r\nsecretiveness than your courage. How could you endure the visitations of that\r\nlong spectre, time after time, without crying out, telling everybody, and\r\nrousing the whole house and neighbourhood?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, and how did you like the nun as a bed-fellow? I dressed her up:\r\ndidn\u2019t I do it well? Did you shriek when you saw her: I should have gone mad;\r\nbut then you have such nerves!\u2014real iron and bend-leather! I believe you feel\r\nnothing. You haven\u2019t the same sensitiveness that a person of my constitution\r\nhas. You seem to me insensible both to pain and fear and grief. You are a real\r\nold Diogenes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, dear grandmother! and are you not mightily angry at my moonlight\r\nflitting and run away match? I assure you it is excellent fun, and I did it\r\npartly to spite that minx, Paulina, and that bear, Dr. John: to show them that,\r\nwith all their airs, I could get married as well as they. M. de Bassompierre\r\nwas at first in a strange fume with Alfred; he threatened a prosecution for\r\n\u2018d\u00e9tournement de mineur,\u2019 and I know not what; he was so abominably in earnest,\r\nthat I found myself forced to do a little bit of the melodramatic\u2014go down on my\r\nknees, sob, cry, drench three pocket-handkerchiefs. Of course, \u2018mon oncle\u2019 soon\r\ngave in; indeed, where was the use of making a fuss? I am married, and that\u2019s\r\nall about it. He still says our marriage is not legal, because I am not of age,\r\nforsooth! As if that made any difference! I am just as much married as if I\r\nwere a hundred. However, we are to be married again, and I am to have a\r\ntrousseau, and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to superintend it; and there are some\r\nhopes that M. de Bassompierre will give me a decent portion, which will be very\r\nconvenient, as dear Alfred has nothing but his nobility, native and hereditary,\r\nand his pay. I only wish uncle would do things unconditionally, in a generous,\r\ngentleman-like fashion; he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on\r\nAlfred\u2019s giving his written promise that he will never touch cards or dice from\r\nthe day it is paid down. They accuse my angel of a tendency to play: I don\u2019t\r\nknow anything about that, but I do know he is a dear, adorable creature.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot sufficiently extol the genius with which de Hamal managed our flight.\r\nHow clever in him to select the night of the f\u00eate, when Madame (for he knows\r\nher habits), as he said, would infallibly be absent at the concert in the park.\r\nI suppose you must have gone with her. I watched you rise and leave the\r\ndormitory about eleven o\u2019clock. How you returned alone, and on foot, I cannot\r\nconjecture. That surely was you we met in the narrow old Rue St. Jean?\r\nDid you see me wave my handkerchief from the carriage window?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAdieu! Rejoice in my good luck: congratulate me on my supreme happiness, and\r\nbelieve me, dear cynic and misanthrope, yours, in the best of health and\r\nspirits,\r\n\n\r\nGINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL,\r\nn\u00e9e FANSHAWE.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cP.S.\u2014Remember, I am a countess now. Papa, mamma, and the girls at home, will\r\nbe delighted to hear that. \u2018My daughter the Countess!\u2019 \u2018My sister the\r\nCountess!\u2019 Bravo! Sounds rather better than Mrs. John Bretton, hein?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn winding up Mistress Fanshawe\u2019s memoirs, the reader will no doubt expect to\r\nhear that she came finally to bitter expiation of her youthful levities. Of\r\ncourse, a large share of suffering lies in reserve for her future.\r\n\n\r\nA few words will embody my farther knowledge respecting her.\r\n\n\r\nI saw her towards the close of her honeymoon. She called on Madame Beck, and\r\nsent for me into the salon. She rushed into my arms laughing. She looked very\r\nblooming and beautiful: her curls were longer, her cheeks rosier than ever: her\r\nwhite bonnet and her Flanders veil, her orange-flowers and her bride\u2019s dress,\r\nbecame her mightily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have got my portion!\u201d she cried at once; (Ginevra ever stuck to the\r\nsubstantial; I always thought there was a good trading element in her\r\ncomposition, much as she scorned the \u201cbourgeoise;\u201d) \u201cand uncle de Bassompierre\r\nis quite reconciled. I don\u2019t mind his calling Alfred a \u2018nincompoop\u2019\u2014that\u2019s only\r\nhis coarse Scotch breeding; and I believe Paulina envies me, and Dr. John is\r\nwild with jealousy\u2014fit to blow his brains out\u2014and I\u2019m so happy! I really think\r\nI\u2019ve hardly anything left to wish for\u2014unless it be a carriage and an hotel,\r\nand, oh! I\u2014must introduce you to \u2018mon mari.\u2019 Alfred, come here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Alfred appeared from the inner salon, where he was talking to Madame Beck,\r\nreceiving the blended felicitations and reprimands of that lady. I was\r\npresented under my various names: the Dragon, Diogenes, and Timon. The young\r\nColonel was very polite. He made me a prettily-turned, neatly-worded apology,\r\nabout the ghost-visits, &c., concluding with saying that \u201cthe best excuse\r\nfor all his iniquities stood there!\u201d pointing to his bride.\r\n\n\r\nAnd then the bride sent him back to Madame Beck, and she took me to herself,\r\nand proceeded literally to suffocate me with her unrestrained spirits, her\r\ngirlish, giddy, wild nonsense. She showed her ring exultingly; she called\r\nherself Madame la Comtesse de Hamal, and asked how it sounded, a score of\r\ntimes. I said very little. I gave her only the crust and rind of my nature. No\r\nmatter she expected of me nothing better\u2014she knew me too well to look for\r\ncompliments\u2014my dry gibes pleased her well enough and the more impassible and\r\nprosaic my mien, the more merrily she laughed.\r\n\n\r\nSoon after his marriage, M. de Hamal was persuaded to leave the army as the\r\nsurest way of weaning him from certain unprofitable associates and habits; a\r\npost of attach\u00e9 was procured for him, and he and his young wife went abroad. I\r\nthought she would forget me now, but she did not. For many years, she kept up a\r\ncapricious, fitful sort of correspondence. During the first year or two, it was\r\nonly of herself and Alfred she wrote; then, Alfred faded in the background;\r\nherself and a certain, new comer prevailed; one Alfred Fanshawe de Bassompierre\r\nde Hamal began to reign in his father\u2019s stead. There were great boastings about\r\nthis personage, extravagant amplifications upon miracles of precocity, mixed\r\nwith vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic incredulity with which I\r\nreceived them. I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat it was to be a mother;\u201d \u201cunfeeling thing\r\nthat I was, the sensibilities of the maternal heart were Greek and Hebrew to\r\nme,\u201d and so on. In due course of nature this young gentleman took his degrees\r\nin teething, measles, hooping-cough: that was a terrible time for me\u2014the\r\nmamma\u2019s letters became a perfect shout of affliction; never woman was so put\r\nupon by calamity: never human being stood in such need of sympathy. I was\r\nfrightened at first, and wrote back pathetically; but I soon found out there\r\nwas more cry than wool in the business, and relapsed into my natural cruel\r\ninsensibility. As to the youthful sufferer, he weathered each storm like a\r\nhero. Five times was that youth \u201cin articulo mortis,\u201d and five times did he\r\nmiraculously revive.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of years there arose ominous murmurings against Alfred the First;\r\nM. de Bassompierre had to be appealed to, debts had to be paid, some of them of\r\nthat dismal and dingy order called \u201cdebts of honour;\u201d ignoble plaints and\r\ndifficulties became frequent. Under every cloud, no matter what its nature,\r\nGinevra, as of old, called out lustily for sympathy and aid. She had no notion\r\nof meeting any distress single-handed. In some shape, from some quarter or\r\nother, she was pretty sure to obtain her will, and so she got on\u2014fighting the\r\nbattle of life by proxy, and, on the whole, suffering as little as any human\r\nbeing I have ever known.\r\n\n"}
{"42": "\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nFAUBOURG CLOTILDE.\n\r\nMust I, ere I close, render some account of that Freedom and Renovation which I\r\nwon on the f\u00eate-night? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart companions I\r\nbrought home from the illuminated park bore the test of intimate acquaintance?\r\n\n\r\nI tried them the very next day. They had boasted their strength loudly when\r\nthey reclaimed me from love and its bondage, but upon my demanding deeds, not\r\nwords, some evidence of better comfort, some experience of a relieved\r\nlife\u2014Freedom excused himself, as for the present impoverished and disabled to\r\nassist; and Renovation never spoke; he had died in the night suddenly.\r\n\n\r\nI had nothing left for it then but to trust secretly that conjecture might have\r\nhurried me too fast and too far, to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of\r\nthe distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy. After a short and vain\r\nstruggle, I found myself brought back captive to the old rack of suspense, tied\r\ndown and strained anew.\r\n\n\r\nShall I yet see him before he goes? Will he bear me in mind? Does he purpose to\r\ncome? Will this day\u2014will the next hour bring him? or must I again assay that\r\ncorroding pain of long attent\u2014that rude agony of rupture at the close, that\r\nmute, mortal wrench, which, in at once uprooting hope and doubt, shakes life;\r\nwhile the hand that does the violence cannot be caressed to pity, because\r\nabsence interposes her barrier!\r\n\n\r\nIt was the Feast of the Assumption; no school was held. The boarders and\r\nteachers, after attending mass in the morning, were gone a long walk into the\r\ncountry to take their go\u00fbter, or afternoon meal, at some farm-house. I did not\r\ngo with them, for now but two days remained ere the Paul et Virginie\r\nmust sail, and I was clinging to my last chance, as the living waif of a wreck\r\nclings to his last raft or cable.\r\n\n\r\nThere was some joiners\u2019 work to do in the first classe, some bench or desk to\r\nrepair; holidays were often turned to account for the performance of these\r\noperations, which could not be executed when the rooms were filled with pupils.\r\nAs I sat solitary, purposing to adjourn to the garden and leave the coast\r\nclear, but too listless to fulfil my own intent, I heard the workmen coming.\r\n\n\r\nForeign artisans and servants do everything by couples: I believe it would take\r\ntwo Labassecourien carpenters to drive a nail. While tying on my bonnet, which\r\nhad hitherto hung by its ribbons from my idle hand, I vaguely and momentarily\r\nwondered to hear the step of but one \u201couvrier.\u201d I noted, too\u2014as captives in\r\ndungeons find sometimes dreary leisure to note the merest trifles\u2014that this man\r\nwore shoes, and not sabots: I concluded that it must be the master-carpenter,\r\ncoming to inspect before he sent his journeymen. I threw round me my scarf. He\r\nadvanced; he opened the door; my back was towards it; I felt a little thrill\u2014a\r\ncurious sensation, too quick and transient to be analyzed. I turned, I stood in\r\nthe supposed master-artisan\u2019s presence: looking towards the door-way, I saw it\r\nfilled with a figure, and my eyes printed upon my brain the picture of M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\nHundreds of the prayers with which we weary Heaven bring to the suppliant no\r\nfulfilment. Once haply in life, one golden gift falls prone in the lap\u2014one boon\r\nfull and bright, perfect from Fruition\u2019s mint.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel wore the dress in which he probably purposed to travel\u2014a surtout,\r\nguarded with velvet; I thought him prepared for instant departure, and yet I\r\nhad understood that two days were yet to run before the ship sailed. He looked\r\nwell and cheerful. He looked kind and benign: he came in with eagerness; he was\r\nclose to me in one second; he was all amity. It might be his bridegroom mood\r\nwhich thus brightened him. Whatever the cause, I could not meet his sunshine\r\nwith cloud. If this were my last moment with him, I would not waste it in\r\nforced, unnatural distance. I loved him well\u2014too well not to smite out of my\r\npath even Jealousy herself, when she would have obstructed a kind farewell. A\r\ncordial word from his lips, or a gentle look from his eyes, would do me good,\r\nfor all the span of life that remained to me; it would be comfort in the last\r\nstrait of loneliness; I would take it\u2014I would taste the elixir, and pride\r\nshould not spill the cup.\r\n\n\r\nThe interview would be short, of course: he would say to me just what he had\r\nsaid to each of the assembled pupils; he would take and hold my hand two\r\nminutes; he would touch my cheek with his lips for the first, last, only\r\ntime\u2014and then\u2014no more. Then, indeed, the final parting, then the wide\r\nseparation, the great gulf I could not pass to go to him\u2014across which, haply,\r\nhe would not glance, to remember me.\r\n\n\r\nHe took my hand in one of his, with the other he put back my bonnet; he looked\r\ninto my face, his luminous smile went out, his lips expressed something almost\r\nlike the wordless language of a mother who finds a child greatly and\r\nunexpectedly changed, broken with illness, or worn out by want. A check\r\nsupervened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPaul, Paul!\u201d said a woman\u2019s hurried voice behind, \u201cPaul, come into the salon;\r\nI have yet a great many things to say to you\u2014conversation for the whole day\u2014and\r\nso has Victor; and Josef is here. Come Paul, come to your friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck, brought to the spot by vigilance or an inscrutable instinct,\r\npressed so near, she almost thrust herself between me and M. Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Paul!\u201d she reiterated, her eye grazing me with its hard ray like a steel\r\nstylet. She pushed against her kinsman. I thought he receded; I thought he\r\nwould go. Pierced deeper than I could endure, made now to feel what defied\r\nsuppression, I cried\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy heart will break!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat I felt seemed literal heart-break; but the seal of another fountain\r\nyielded under the strain: one breath from M. Paul, the whisper, \u201cTrust me!\u201d\r\nlifted a load, opened an outlet. With many a deep sob, with thrilling, with icy\r\nshiver, with strong trembling, and yet with relief\u2014I wept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave her to me; it is a crisis: I will give her a cordial, and it will pass,\u201d\r\nsaid the calm Madame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nTo be left to her and her cordial seemed to me something like being left to the\r\npoisoner and her bowl. When M. Paul answered deeply, harshly, and\r\nbriefly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLaissez-moi!\u201d in the grim sound I felt a music strange, strong, but\r\nlife-giving.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLaissez-moi!\u201d he repeated, his nostrils opening, and his facial muscles all\r\nquivering as he spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut this will never do,\u201d said Madame, with sternness. More sternly rejoined\r\nher kinsman\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSortez d\u2019ici!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will send for P\u00e8re Silas: on the spot I will send for him,\u201d she threatened\r\npertinaciously.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFemme!\u201d cried the Professor, not now in his deep tones, but in his highest and\r\nmost excited key, \u201cFemme! sortez \u00e0 l\u2019instant!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was roused, and I loved him in his wrath with a passion beyond what I had\r\nyet felt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat you do is wrong,\u201d pursued Madame; \u201cit is an act characteristic of men of\r\nyour unreliable, imaginative temperament; a step impulsive, injudicious,\r\ninconsistent\u2014a proceeding vexatious, and not estimable in the view of persons\r\nof steadier and more resolute character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know not what I have of steady and resolute in me,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you\r\nshall see; the event shall teach you. Modeste,\u201d he continued less fiercely, \u201cbe\r\ngentle, be pitying, be a woman; look at this poor face, and relent. You know I\r\nam your friend, and the friend of your friends; in spite of your taunts, you\r\nwell and deeply know I may be trusted. Of sacrificing myself I made no\r\ndifficulty but my heart is pained by what I see; it must have and give\r\nsolace. Leave me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis time, in the \u201cleave me\u201d there was an intonation so bitter and so\r\nimperative, I wondered that even Madame Beck herself could for one moment delay\r\nobedience; but she stood firm; she gazed upon him dauntless; she met his eye,\r\nforbidding and fixed as stone. She was opening her lips to retort; I saw over\r\nall M. Paul\u2019s face a quick rising light and fire; I can hardly tell how he\r\nmanaged the movement; it did not seem violent; it kept the form of courtesy; he\r\ngave his hand; it scarce touched her I thought; she ran, she whirled from the\r\nroom; she was gone, and the door shut, in one second.\r\n\n\r\nThe flash of passion was all over very soon. He smiled as he told me to wipe my\r\neyes; he waited quietly till I was calm, dropping from time to time a stilling,\r\nsolacing word. Ere long I sat beside him once more myself\u2014re-assured, not\r\ndesperate, nor yet desolate; not friendless, not hopeless, not sick of life,\r\nand seeking death.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt made you very sad then to lose your friend?\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt kills me to be forgotten, Monsieur,\u201d I said. \u201cAll these weary days I have\r\nnot heard from you one word, and I was crushed with the possibility, growing to\r\ncertainty, that you would depart without saying farewell!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust I tell you what I told Modeste Beck\u2014that you do not know me? Must I show\r\nand teach you my character? You will have proof that I can be a firm\r\nfriend? Without clear proof this hand will not lie still in mine, it will not\r\ntrust my shoulder as a safe stay? Good. The proof is ready. I come to justify\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay anything, teach anything, prove anything, Monsieur; I can listen now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, in the first place, you must go out with me a good distance into the\r\ntown. I came on purpose to fetch you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout questioning his meaning, or sounding his plan, or offering the\r\nsemblance of an objection, I re-tied my bonnet: I was ready.\r\n\n\r\nThe route he took was by the boulevards: he several times made me sit down on\r\nthe seats stationed under the lime-trees; he did not ask if I was tired, but\r\nlooked, and drew his own conclusions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll these weary days,\u201d said he, repeating my words, with a gentle, kindly\r\nmimicry of my voice and foreign accent, not new from his lips, and of which the\r\nplayful banter never wounded, not even when coupled, as it often was, with the\r\nassertion, that however I might write his language, I spoke and\r\nalways should speak it imperfectly and hesitatingly. \u201c\u2018All these weary days\u2019 I\r\nhave not for one hour forgotten you. Faithful women err in this, that they\r\nthink themselves the sole faithful of God\u2019s creatures. On a very fervent and\r\nliving truth to myself, I, too, till lately scarce dared count, from any\r\nquarter; but\u2014\u2014look at me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI lifted my happy eyes: they were happy now, or they would have been no\r\ninterpreters of my heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, after some seconds\u2019 scrutiny, \u201cthere is no denying that\r\nsignature: Constancy wrote it: her pen is of iron. Was the record painful?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSeverely painful,\u201d I said, with truth. \u201cWithdraw her hand, Monsieur; I can\r\nbear its inscribing force no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElle est toute p\u00e2le,\u201d said he, speaking to himself; \u201ccette figure-l\u00e0 me fait\r\nmal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! I am not pleasant to look at\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help saying this; the words came unbidden: I never remember the\r\ntime when I had not a haunting dread of what might be the degree of my outward\r\ndeficiency; this dread pressed me at the moment with special force.\r\n\n\r\nA great softness passed upon his countenance; his violet eyes grew suffused and\r\nglistening under their deep Spanish lashes: he started up; \u201cLet us walk on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo I displease your eyes much?\u201d I took courage to urge: the point had\r\nits vital import for me.\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped, and gave me a short, strong answer; an answer which silenced,\r\nsubdued, yet profoundly satisfied. Ever after that I knew what I was for\r\nhim; and what I might be for the rest of the world, I ceased painfully\r\nto care. Was it weak to lay so much stress on an opinion about appearance? I\r\nfear it might be; I fear it was; but in that case I must avow no light share of\r\nweakness. I must own great fear of displeasing\u2014a strong wish moderately to\r\nplease M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\nWhither we rambled, I scarce knew. Our walk was long, yet seemed short; the\r\npath was pleasant, the day lovely. M. Emanuel talked of his voyage\u2014he thought\r\nof staying away three years. On his return from Guadaloupe, he looked forward\r\nto release from liabilities and a clear course; and what did I purpose doing in\r\nthe interval of his absence? he asked. I had talked once, he reminded me, of\r\ntrying to be independent and keeping a little school of my own: had I dropped\r\nthe idea?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I had not: I was doing my best to save what would enable me to put it\r\nin practice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe did not like leaving me in the Rue Fossette; he feared I should miss him\r\nthere too much\u2014I should feel desolate\u2014I should grow sad\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was certain; but I promised to do my best to endure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d said he, speaking low, \u201cthere is another objection to your present\r\nresidence. I should wish to write to you sometimes: it would not be well to\r\nhave any uncertainty about the safe transmission of letters; and in the Rue\r\nFossette\u2014in short, our Catholic discipline in certain matters\u2014though\r\njustifiable and expedient\u2014might possibly, under peculiar circumstances, become\r\nliable to misapplication\u2014perhaps abuse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if you write,\u201d said I, \u201cI must have your letters; and I will\r\nhave them: ten directors, twenty directresses, shall not keep them from me. I\r\nam a Protestant: I will not bear that kind of discipline: Monsieur, I will\r\nnot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoucement\u2014doucement,\u201d rejoined he; \u201cwe will contrive a plan; we have our\r\nresources: soyez tranquille.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo speaking, he paused.\r\n\n\r\nWe were now returning from the long walk. We had reached the middle of a clean\r\nFaubourg, where the houses were small, but looked pleasant. It was before the\r\nwhite door-step of a very neat abode that M. Paul had halted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI call here,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not knock, but taking from his pocket a key, he opened and entered at\r\nonce. Ushering me in, he shut the door behind us. No servant appeared. The\r\nvestibule was small, like the house, but freshly and tastefully painted; its\r\nvista closed in a French window with vines trained about the panes, tendrils,\r\nand green leaves kissing the glass. Silence reigned in this dwelling.\r\n\n\r\nOpening an inner door, M. Paul disclosed a parlour, or salon\u2014very tiny, but I\r\nthought, very pretty. Its delicate walls were tinged like a blush; its floor\r\nwas waxed; a square of brilliant carpet covered its centre; its small round\r\ntable shone like the mirror over its hearth; there was a little couch, a little\r\nchiffonni\u00e8re, the half-open, crimson-silk door of which, showed porcelain on\r\nthe shelves; there was a French clock, a lamp; there were ornaments in biscuit\r\nchina; the recess of the single ample window was filled with a green stand,\r\nbearing three green flower-pots, each filled with a fine plant glowing in\r\nbloom; in one corner appeared a gu\u00e9ridon with a marble top, and upon it a\r\nwork-box, and a glass filled with violets in water. The lattice of this room\r\nwas open; the outer air breathing through, gave freshness, the sweet violets\r\nlent fragrance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty, pretty place!\u201d said I. M. Paul smiled to see me so pleased.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust we sit down here and wait?\u201d I asked in a whisper, half awed by the deep\r\npervading hush.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe will first peep into one or two other nooks of this nutshell,\u201d he replied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDare you take the freedom of going all over the house?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I dare,\u201d said he, quietly.\r\n\n\r\nHe led the way. I was shown a little kitchen with a little stove and oven, with\r\nfew but bright brasses, two chairs and a table. A small cupboard held a\r\ndiminutive but commodious set of earthenware.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a coffee service of china in the salon,\u201d said M. Paul, as I looked at\r\nthe six green and white dinner-plates; the four dishes, the cups and jugs to\r\nmatch.\r\n\n\r\nConducted up the narrow but clean staircase, I was permitted a glimpse of two\r\npretty cabinets of sleeping-rooms; finally, I was once more led below, and we\r\nhalted with a certain ceremony before a larger door than had yet been opened.\r\n\n\r\nProducing a second key, M. Emanuel adjusted it to the lock of this door. He\r\nopened, put me in before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoici!\u201d he cried.\r\n\n\r\nI found myself in a good-sized apartment, scrupulously clean, though bare,\r\ncompared with those I had hitherto seen. The well-scoured boards were\r\ncarpetless; it contained two rows of green benches and desks, with an alley\r\ndown the centre, terminating in an estrade, a teacher\u2019s chair and table; behind\r\nthem a tableau. On the walls hung two maps; in the windows flowered a few hardy\r\nplants; in short, here was a miniature classe\u2014complete, neat, pleasant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a school then?\u201d said I. \u201cWho keeps it? I never heard of an establishment\r\nin this faubourg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you have the goodness to accept of a few prospectuses for distribution in\r\nbehalf of a friend of mine?\u201d asked he, taking from his surtout-pocket some\r\nquires of these documents, and putting them into my hand. I looked, I\r\nread\u2014printed in fair characters:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExternat de demoiselles. Num\u00e9ro 7, Faubourg Clotilde, Directrice, Mademoiselle\r\nLucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd what did I say to M. Paul Emanuel?\r\n\n\r\nCertain junctures of our lives must always be difficult of recall to memory.\r\nCertain points, crises, certain feelings, joys, griefs, and amazements, when\r\nreviewed, must strike us as things wildered and whirling, dim as a wheel fast\r\nspun.\r\n\n\r\nI can no more remember the thoughts or the words of the ten minutes succeeding\r\nthis disclosure, than I can retrace the experience of my earliest year of life:\r\nand yet the first thing distinct to me is the consciousness that I was speaking\r\nvery fast, repeating over and over again:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you do this, M. Paul? Is this your house? Did you furnish it? Did you get\r\nthese papers printed? Do you mean me? Am I the directress? Is there another\r\nLucy Snowe? Tell me: say something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut he would not speak. His pleased silence, his laughing down-look, his\r\nattitude, are visible to me now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is it? I must know all\u2014all,\u201d I cried.\r\n\n\r\nThe packet of papers fell on the floor. He had extended his hand, and I had\r\nfastened thereon, oblivious of all else.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you said I had forgotten you all these weary days,\u201d said he. \u201cPoor old\r\nEmanuel! These are the thanks he gets for trudging about three mortal weeks\r\nfrom house-painter to upholsterer, from cabinet-maker to charwoman. Lucy and\r\nLucy\u2019s cot, the sole thoughts in his head!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hardly knew what to do. I first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff, and\r\nthen. I stroked the hand it surrounded. It was his foresight, his goodness, his\r\nsilent, strong, effective goodness, that overpowered me by their proved\r\nreality. It was the assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like\r\na light from heaven; it was his\u2014I will dare to say it\u2014his fond, tender look,\r\nwhich now shook me indescribably. In the midst of all I forced myself to look\r\nat the practical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe trouble!\u201d I cried, \u201cand the cost! Had you money, M. Paul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlenty of money!\u201d said he heartily. \u201cThe disposal of my large teaching\r\nconnection put me in possession of a handsome sum with part of it I determined\r\nto give myself the richest treat that I have known or shall know.\r\nI like this. I have reckoned on this hour day and night lately. I would not\r\ncome near you, because I would not forestall it. Reserve is neither my virtue\r\nnor my vice. If I had put myself into your power, and you had begun with your\r\nquestions of look and lip\u2014Where have you been, M. Paul? What have you been\r\ndoing? What is your mystery?\u2014my solitary first and last secret would presently\r\nhave unravelled itself in your lap. Now,\u201d he pursued, \u201cyou shall live here and\r\nhave a school; you shall employ yourself while I am away; you shall think of me\r\nsometimes; you shall mind your health and happiness for my sake, and when I\r\ncome back\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere he left a blank.\r\n\n\r\nI promised to do all he told me. I promised to work hard and willingly. \u201cI will\r\nbe your faithful steward,\u201d I said; \u201cI trust at your coming the account will be\r\nready. Monsieur, monsieur, you are too good!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn such inadequate language my feelings struggled for expression: they could\r\nnot get it; speech, brittle and unmalleable, and cold as ice, dissolved or\r\nshivered in the effort. He watched me, still; he gently raised his hand to\r\nstroke my hair; it touched my lips in passing; I pressed it close, I paid it\r\ntribute. He was my king; royal for me had been that hand\u2019s bounty; to offer\r\nhomage was both a joy and a duty.\r\n\n\r\nThe afternoon hours were over, and the stiller time of evening shaded the quiet\r\nfaubourg. M. Paul claimed my hospitality; occupied and afoot since morning, he\r\nneeded refreshment; he said I should offer him chocolate in my pretty gold and\r\nwhite china service. He went out and ordered what was needful from the\r\nrestaurant; he placed the small gu\u00e9ridon and two chairs in the balcony outside\r\nthe French window under the screening vines. With what shy joy I accepted my\r\npart as hostess, arranged the salver, served the benefactor-guest.\r\n\n\r\nThis balcony was in the rear of the house, the gardens of the faubourg were\r\nround us, fields extended beyond. The air was still, mild, and fresh. Above the\r\npoplars, the laurels, the cypresses, and the roses, looked up a moon so lovely\r\nand so halcyon, the heart trembled under her smile; a star shone subject beside\r\nher, with the unemulous ray of pure love. In a large garden near us, a jet rose\r\nfrom a well, and a pale statue leaned over the play of waters.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul talked to me. His voice was so modulated that it mixed harmonious with\r\nthe silver whisper, the gush, the musical sigh, in which light breeze, fountain\r\nand foliage intoned their lulling vesper:\r\n\n\r\nHappy hour\u2014stay one moment! droop those plumes, rest those wings; incline to\r\nmine that brow of Heaven! White Angel! let thy light linger; leave its\r\nreflection on succeeding clouds; bequeath its cheer to that time which needs a\r\nray in retrospect!\r\n\n\r\nOur meal was simple: the chocolate, the rolls, the plate of fresh summer fruit,\r\ncherries and strawberries bedded in green leaves formed the whole: but it was\r\nwhat we both liked better than a feast, and I took a delight inexpressible in\r\ntending M. Paul. I asked him whether his friends, P\u00e8re Silas and Madame Beck,\r\nknew what he had done\u2014whether they had seen my house?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon amie,\u201d said he, \u201cnone knows what I have done save you and myself: the\r\npleasure is consecrated to us two, unshared and unprofaned. To speak truth,\r\nthere has been to me in this matter a refinement of enjoyment I would not make\r\nvulgar by communication. Besides\u201d (smiling) \u201cI wanted to prove to Miss Lucy\r\nthat I could keep a secret. How often has she taunted me with lack of\r\ndignified reserve and needful caution! How many times has she saucily\r\ninsinuated that all my affairs are the secret of Polichinelle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was true enough: I had not spared him on this point, nor perhaps on any\r\nother that was assailable. Magnificent-minded, grand-hearted, dear, faulty\r\nlittle man! You deserved candour, and from me always had it.\r\n\n\r\nContinuing my queries, I asked to whom the house belonged, who was my landlord,\r\nthe amount of my rent. He instantly gave me these particulars in writing; he\r\nhad foreseen and prepared all things.\r\n\n\r\nThe house was not M. Paul\u2019s\u2014that I guessed: he was hardly the man to become a\r\nproprietor; I more than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving\r\nfaculty; he could get, but not keep; he needed a treasurer. The tenement, then,\r\nbelonged to a citizen in the Basse-Ville\u2014a man of substance, M. Paul said; he\r\nstartled me by adding: \u201ca friend of yours, Miss Lucy, a person who has a most\r\nrespectful regard for you.\u201d And, to my pleasant surprise, I found the landlord\r\nwas none other than M. Miret, the short-tempered and kind-hearted bookseller,\r\nwho had so kindly found me a seat that eventful night in the park. It seems M.\r\nMiret was, in his station, rich, as well as much respected, and possessed\r\nseveral houses in this faubourg; the rent was moderate, scarce half of what it\r\nwould have been for a house of equal size nearer the centre of Villette.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d observed M. Paul, \u201cshould fortune not favour you, though I think\r\nshe will, I have the satisfaction to think you are in good hands; M. Miret will\r\nnot be extortionate: the first year\u2019s rent you have already in your savings;\r\nafterwards Miss Lucy must trust God, and herself. But now, what will you do for\r\npupils?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must distribute my prospectuses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight! By way of losing no time, I gave one to M. Miret yesterday. Should you\r\nobject to beginning with three petite bourgeoises, the Demoiselles Miret? They\r\nare at your service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, you forget nothing; you are wonderful. Object? It would become me\r\nindeed to object! I suppose I hardly expect at the outset to number aristocrats\r\nin my little day-school; I care not if they never come. I shall be proud to\r\nreceive M. Miret\u2019s daughters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBesides these,\u201d pursued he, \u201canother pupil offers, who will come daily to take\r\nlessons in English; and as she is rich, she will pay handsomely. I mean my\r\ngod-daughter and ward, Justine Marie Sauveur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat is in a name?\u2014what in three words? Till this moment I had listened with\r\nliving joy\u2014I had answered with gleeful quickness; a name froze me; three words\r\nstruck me mute. The effect could not be hidden, and indeed I scarce tried to\r\nhide it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing! Your countenance changes: your colour and your very eyes fade.\r\nNothing! You must be ill; you have some suffering; tell me what.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had nothing to tell.\r\n\n\r\nHe drew his chair nearer. He did not grow vexed, though I continued silent and\r\nicy. He tried to win a word; he entreated with perseverance, he waited with\r\npatience.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie is a good girl,\u201d said he, \u201cdocile and amiable; not quick\u2014but you\r\nwill like her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not. I think she must not come here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch was my speech.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you wish to puzzle me? Do you know her? But, in truth, there is\r\nsomething. Again you are pale as that statue. Rely on Paul Carlos; tell him the\r\ngrief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis chair touched mine; his hand, quietly advanced, turned me towards him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know Marie Justine?\u201d said he again.\r\n\n\r\nThe name re-pronounced by his lips overcame me unaccountably. It did not\r\nprostrate\u2014no, it stirred me up, running with haste and heat through my\r\nveins\u2014recalling an hour of quick pain, many days and nights of heart-sickness.\r\nNear me as he now sat, strongly and closely as he had long twined his life in\r\nmine\u2014far as had progressed, and near as was achieved our minds\u2019 and affections\u2019\r\nassimilation\u2014the very suggestion of interference, of heart-separation, could be\r\nheard only with a fermenting excitement, an impetuous throe, a disdainful\r\nresolve, an ire, a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the\r\nflame, nor any truth-accustomed human tongue curb the cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d I said: \u201cI want to tell you all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak, Lucy; come near; speak. Who prizes you, if I do not? Who is your\r\nfriend, if not Emanuel? Speak!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI spoke. All escaped from my lips. I lacked not words now; fast I narrated;\r\nfluent I told my tale; it streamed on my tongue. I went back to the night in\r\nthe park; I mentioned the medicated draught\u2014why it was given\u2014its goading\r\neffect\u2014how it had torn rest from under my head, shaken me from my couch,\r\ncarried me abroad with the lure of a vivid yet solemn fancy\u2014a summer-night\r\nsolitude on turf, under trees, near a deep, cool lakelet. I told the scene\r\nrealized; the crowd, the masques, the music, the lamps, the splendours, the\r\nguns booming afar, the bells sounding on high. All I had encountered I\r\ndetailed, all I had recognised, heard, and seen; how I had beheld and watched\r\nhimself: how I listened, how much heard, what conjectured; the whole history,\r\nin brief, summoned to his confidence, rushed thither, truthful, literal,\r\nardent, bitter.\r\n\n\r\nStill as I narrated, instead of checking, he incited me to proceed, he spurred\r\nme by the gesture, the smile, the half-word. Before I had half done, he held\r\nboth my hands, he consulted my eyes with a most piercing glance: there was\r\nsomething in his face which tended neither to calm nor to put me down; he\r\nforgot his own doctrine, he forsook his own system of repression when I most\r\nchallenged its exercise. I think I deserved strong reproof; but when have we\r\nour deserts? I merited severity; he looked indulgence. To my very self I seemed\r\nimperious and unreasonable, for I forbade Justine Marie my door and roof; he\r\nsmiled, betraying delight. Warm, jealous, and haughty, I knew not till now that\r\nmy nature had such a mood: he gathered me near his heart. I was full of faults;\r\nhe took them and me all home. For the moment of utmost mutiny, he reserved the\r\none deep spell of peace. These words caressed my ear:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, take my love. One day share my life. Be my dearest, first on earth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe walked back to the Rue Fossette by moonlight\u2014such moonlight as fell on\r\nEden\u2014shining through the shades of the Great Garden, and haply gilding a path\r\nglorious for a step divine\u2014a Presence nameless. Once in their lives some men\r\nand women go back to these first fresh days of our great Sire and Mother\u2014taste\r\nthat grand morning\u2019s dew\u2014bathe in its sunrise.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the walk I was told how Justine Marie Sauveur had always been\r\nregarded with the affection proper to a daughter\u2014how, with M. Paul\u2019s consent,\r\nshe had been affianced for months to one Heinrich M\u00fchler, a wealthy young\r\nGerman merchant, and was to be married in the course of a year. Some of M.\r\nEmanuel\u2019s relations and connections would, indeed, it seems, have liked him to\r\nmarry her, with a view to securing her fortune in the family; but to himself\r\nthe scheme was repugnant, and the idea totally inadmissible.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached Madame Beck\u2019s door. Jean Baptiste\u2019s clock tolled nine. At this hour,\r\nin this house, eighteen months since, had this man at my side bent before me,\r\nlooked into my face and eyes, and arbitered my destiny. This very evening he\r\nhad again stooped, gazed, and decreed. How different the look\u2014how far otherwise\r\nthe fate!\r\n\n\r\nHe deemed me born under his star: he seemed to have spread over me its beam\r\nlike a banner. Once\u2014unknown, and unloved, I held him harsh and strange; the low\r\nstature, the wiry make, the angles, the darkness, the manner, displeased me.\r\nNow, penetrated with his influence, and living by his affection, having his\r\nworth by intellect, and his goodness by heart\u2014I preferred him before all\r\nhumanity.\r\n\n\r\nWe parted: he gave me his pledge, and then his farewell. We parted: the next\r\nday\u2014he sailed.\r\n\n"}
{"43": "\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nFINIS.\n\r\nMan cannot prophesy. Love is no oracle. Fear sometimes imagines a vain thing.\r\nThose years of absence! How had I sickened over their anticipation! The woe\r\nthey must bring seemed certain as death. I knew the nature of their course: I\r\nnever had doubt how it would harrow as it went. The juggernaut on his car\r\ntowered there a grim load. Seeing him draw nigh, burying his broad wheels in\r\nthe oppressed soil\u2014I, the prostrate votary\u2014felt beforehand the annihilating\r\ncraunch.\r\n\n\r\nStrange to say\u2014strange, yet true, and owning many parallels in life\u2019s\r\nexperience\u2014that anticipatory craunch proved all\u2014yes\u2014nearly all the\r\ntorture. The great Juggernaut, in his great chariot, drew on lofty, loud, and\r\nsullen. He passed quietly, like a shadow sweeping the sky, at noon. Nothing but\r\na chilling dimness was seen or felt. I looked up. Chariot and demon charioteer\r\nwere gone by; the votary still lived.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were the three happiest years of\r\nmy life. Do you scout the paradox? Listen. I commenced my school; I worked\u2014I\r\nworked hard. I deemed myself the steward of his property, and determined, God\r\nwilling, to render a good account. Pupils came\u2014burghers at first\u2014a higher class\r\nere long. About the middle of the second year an unexpected chance threw into\r\nmy hands an additional hundred pounds: one day I received from England a letter\r\ncontaining that sum. It came from Mr. Marchmont, the cousin and heir of my dear\r\nand dead mistress. He was just recovering from a dangerous illness; the money\r\nwas a peace-offering to his conscience, reproaching him in the matter of, I\r\nknow not what, papers or memoranda found after his kinswoman\u2019s death\u2014naming or\r\nrecommending Lucy Snowe. Mrs. Barrett had given him my address. How far his\r\nconscience had been sinned against, I never inquired. I asked no questions, but\r\ntook the cash and made it useful.\r\n\n\r\nWith this hundred pounds I ventured to take the house adjoining mine. I would\r\nnot leave that which M. Paul had chosen, in which he had left, and where he\r\nexpected again to find me. My externat became a pensionnat; that also\r\nprospered.\r\n\n\r\nThe secret of my success did not lie so much in myself, in any endowment, any\r\npower of mine, as in a new state of circumstances, a wonderfully changed life,\r\na relieved heart. The spring which moved my energies lay far away beyond seas,\r\nin an Indian isle. At parting, I had been left a legacy; such a thought for the\r\npresent, such a hope for the future, such a motive for a persevering, a\r\nlaborious, an enterprising, a patient and a brave course\u2014I could not\r\nflag. Few things shook me now; few things had importance to vex, intimidate, or\r\ndepress me: most things pleased\u2014mere trifles had a charm.\r\n\n\r\nDo not think that this genial flame sustained itself, or lived wholly on a\r\nbequeathed hope or a parting promise. A generous provider supplied bounteous\r\nfuel. I was spared all chill, all stint; I was not suffered to fear penury; I\r\nwas not tried with suspense. By every vessel he wrote; he wrote as he gave and\r\nas he loved, in full-handed, full-hearted plenitude. He wrote because he liked\r\nto write; he did not abridge, because he cared not to abridge. He sat down, he\r\ntook pen and paper, because he loved Lucy and had much to say to her; because\r\nhe was faithful and thoughtful, because he was tender and true. There was no\r\nsham and no cheat, and no hollow unreal in him. Apology never dropped her\r\nslippery oil on his lips\u2014never proffered, by his pen, her coward feints and\r\npaltry nullities: he would give neither a stone, nor an excuse\u2014neither a\r\nscorpion; nor a disappointment; his letters were real food that nourished,\r\nliving water that refreshed.\r\n\n\r\nAnd was I grateful? God knows! I believe that scarce a living being so\r\nremembered, so sustained, dealt with in kind so constant, honourable and noble,\r\ncould be otherwise than grateful to the death.\r\n\n\r\nAdherent to his own religion (in him was not the stuff of which is made the\r\nfacile apostate), he freely left me my pure faith. He did not tease nor tempt.\r\nHe said:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRemain a Protestant. My little English Puritan, I love Protestantism in you. I\r\nown its severe charm. There is something in its ritual I cannot receive myself,\r\nbut it is the sole creed for \u2018Lucy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll Rome could not put into him bigotry, nor the Propaganda itself make him a\r\nreal Jesuit. He was born honest, and not false\u2014artless, and not cunning\u2014a\r\nfreeman, and not a slave. His tenderness had rendered him ductile in a priest\u2019s\r\nhands, his affection, his devotedness, his sincere pious enthusiasm blinded his\r\nkind eyes sometimes, made him abandon justice to himself to do the work of\r\ncraft, and serve the ends of selfishness; but these are faults so rare to find,\r\nso costly to their owner to indulge, we scarce know whether they will not one\r\nday be reckoned amongst the jewels.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now the three years are past: M. Emanuel\u2019s return is fixed. It is Autumn;\r\nhe is to be with me ere the mists of November come. My school flourishes, my\r\nhouse is ready: I have made him a little library, filled its shelves with the\r\nbooks he left in my care: I have cultivated out of love for him (I was\r\nnaturally no florist) the plants he preferred, and some of them are yet in\r\nbloom. I thought I loved him when he went away; I love him now in another\r\ndegree: he is more my own.\r\n\n\r\nThe sun passes the equinox; the days shorten, the leaves grow sere; but\u2014he is\r\ncoming.\r\n\n\r\nFrosts appear at night; November has sent his fogs in advance; the wind takes\r\nits autumn moan; but\u2014he is coming.\r\n\n\r\nThe skies hang full and dark\u2014a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast\r\nthemselves into strange forms\u2014arches and broad radiations; there rise\r\nresplendent mornings\u2014glorious, royal, purple as monarch in his state; the\r\nheavens are one flame; so wild are they, they rival battle at its thickest\u2014so\r\nbloody, they shame Victory in her pride. I know some signs of the sky; I have\r\nnoted them ever since childhood. God watch that sail! Oh! guard it!\r\n\n\r\nThe wind shifts to the west. Peace, peace, Banshee\u2014\u201ckeening\u201d at every window!\r\nIt will rise\u2014it will swell\u2014it shrieks out long: wander as I may through the\r\nhouse this night, I cannot lull the blast. The advancing hours make it strong:\r\nby midnight, all sleepless watchers hear and fear a wild south-west storm. That\r\nstorm roared frenzied, for seven days. It did not cease till the Atlantic was\r\nstrewn with wrecks: it did not lull till the deeps had gorged their full of\r\nsustenance. Not till the destroying angel of tempest had achieved his perfect\r\nwork, would he fold the wings whose waft was thunder\u2014the tremor of whose plumes\r\nwas storm.\r\n\n\r\nPeace, be still! Oh! a thousand weepers, praying in agony on waiting shores,\r\nlistened for that voice, but it was not uttered\u2014not uttered till; when the hush\r\ncame, some could not feel it: till, when the sun returned, his light was night\r\nto some!\r\n\n\r\nHere pause: pause at once. There is enough said. Trouble no quiet, kind heart;\r\nleave sunny imaginations hope. Let it be theirs to conceive the delight of joy\r\nborn again fresh out of great terror, the rapture of rescue from peril, the\r\nwondrous reprieve from dread, the fruition of return. Let them picture union\r\nand a happy succeeding life.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck prospered all the days of her life; so did P\u00e8re Silas; Madame\r\nWalravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died. Farewell.\r\n\nTHE END.\n"}
{"1": "\nPREFACE\n\r\nA preface to the first edition of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d being unnecessary, I gave none:\r\nthis second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and\r\nmiscellaneous remark.\r\n\n\r\nMy thanks are due in three quarters.\r\n\n\r\nTo the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few\r\npretensions.\r\n\n\r\nTo the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure\r\naspirant.\r\n\n\r\nTo my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense\r\nand frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.\r\n\n\r\nThe Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must\r\nthank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain\r\ngenerous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded\r\nmen know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, i.e., to my\r\nPublishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you\r\nfrom my heart.\r\n\n\r\nHaving thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I\r\nturn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be\r\noverlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such\r\nbooks as \u201cJane Eyre:\u201d in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears\r\ndetect in each protest against bigotry\u2014that parent of crime\u2014an insult to piety,\r\nthat regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious\r\ndistinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.\r\n\n\r\nConventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack\r\nthe first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the\r\nPharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.\r\n\n\r\nThese things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is\r\nvice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded:\r\nappearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only\r\ntend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the\r\nworld-redeeming creed of Christ. There is\u2014I repeat it\u2014a difference; and it is a\r\ngood, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation\r\nbetween them.\r\n\n\r\nThe world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been\r\naccustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for\r\nsterling worth\u2014to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines. It may hate\r\nhim who dares to scrutinise and expose\u2014to rase the gilding, and show base metal\r\nunder it\u2014to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it\r\nwill, it is indebted to him.\r\n\n\r\nAhab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but\r\nevil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab\r\nhave escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears to flattery, and\r\nopened them to faithful counsel.\r\n\n\r\nThere is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate\r\nears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the\r\nson of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks\r\ntruth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital\u2014a mien as dauntless\r\nand as daring. Is the satirist of \u201cVanity Fair\u201d admired in high places? I\r\ncannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire\r\nof his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,\r\nwere to take his warnings in time\u2014they or their seed might yet escape a fatal\r\nRimoth-Gilead.\r\n\n\r\nWhy have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think\r\nI see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries\r\nhave yet recognised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of\r\nthe day\u2014as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude\r\nthe warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has\r\nyet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise\r\nhis talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic\r\npowers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop\r\non carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attractive,\r\nbut both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent\r\nsheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric\r\ndeath-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because\r\nto him\u2014if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger\u2014I have dedicated this\r\nsecond edition of \u201cJANE EYRE.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nCURRER BELL.\r\n\n\nDecember 21st, 1847.\r\n\n"}
{"2": "\nNOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION\n\r\nI avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d affords\r\nme, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the\r\ntitle of novelist rests on this one work alone.

{"3": "\nCHAPTER I\n\r\nThere was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering,\r\nindeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner\r\n(Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had\r\nbrought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further\r\noutdoor exercise was now out of the question.\r\n\n\r\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons:\r\ndreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and\r\ntoes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by\r\nthe consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana\r\nReed.\r\n\n\r\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the\r\ndrawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings\r\nabout her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.\r\nMe, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, \u201cShe regretted to be\r\nunder the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from\r\nBessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in\r\ngood earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more\r\nattractive and sprightly manner\u2014something lighter, franker, more natural, as it\r\nwere\u2014she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented,\r\nhappy, little children.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does Bessie say I have done?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I don\u2019t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly\r\nforbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere;\r\nand until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a\r\nbookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be\r\none stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet,\r\nI sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain\r\nnearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.\r\n\n\r\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were\r\nthe clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear\r\nNovember day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied\r\nthe aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and\r\ncloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain\r\nsweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.\r\n\n\r\nI returned to my book\u2014Bewick\u2019s History of British Birds: the letterpress\r\nthereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain\r\nintroductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.\r\nThey were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of \u201cthe solitary rocks\r\nand promontories\u201d by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with\r\nisles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\r\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\r\nOf farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\r\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,\r\nSiberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with \u201cthe vast sweep of\r\nthe Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,\u2014that reservoir of\r\nfrost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of\r\nwinters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and\r\nconcentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.\u201d Of these death-white realms\r\nI formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions\r\nthat float dim through children\u2019s brains, but strangely impressive. The words\r\nin these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,\r\nand gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and\r\nspray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly\r\nmoon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\r\n\n\r\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its\r\ninscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a\r\nbroken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.\r\n\n\r\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\r\n\n\r\nThe fiend pinning down the thief\u2019s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it\r\nwas an object of terror.\r\n\n\r\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd\r\nsurrounding a gallows.\r\n\n\r\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and\r\nimperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the\r\ntales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in\r\ngood humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth,\r\nshe allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed\u2019s lace frills,\r\nand crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love\r\nand adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later\r\nperiod I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.\r\n\n\r\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared\r\nnothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door\r\nopened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoh! Madam Mope!\u201d cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the\r\nroom apparently empty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere the dickens is she!\u201d he continued. \u201cLizzy! Georgy! (calling to his\r\nsisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain\u2014bad animal!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well I drew the curtain,\u201d thought I; and I wished fervently he might not\r\ndiscover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was\r\nnot quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the\r\ndoor, and said at once\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth\r\nby the said Jack.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, with awkward diffidence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay, \u2018What do you want, Master Reed?\u2019\u201d was the answer. \u201cI want you to come\r\nhere;\u201d and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I\r\nwas to approach and stand before him.\r\n\n\r\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I\r\nwas but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin;\r\nthick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He\r\ngorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim\r\nand bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his\r\nmama had taken him home for a month or two, \u201con account of his delicate\r\nhealth.\u201d Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had\r\nfewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother\u2019s heart turned\r\nfrom an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that\r\nJohn\u2019s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after\r\nhome.\r\n\n\r\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.\r\nHe bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or\r\ntwice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every\r\nmorsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I\r\nwas bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever\r\nagainst either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to\r\noffend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was\r\nblind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me,\r\nthough he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however,\r\nbehind her back.\r\n\n\r\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three\r\nminutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging\r\nthe roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on\r\nthe disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder\r\nif he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he\r\nstruck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium\r\nretired back a step or two from his chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,\u201d said he, \u201cand for\r\nyour sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your\r\neyes two minutes since, you rat!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAccustomed to John Reed\u2019s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care\r\nwas how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing behind the curtain?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was reading.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShow the book.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you\r\nhave no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live\r\nhere with gentlemen\u2019s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear\r\nclothes at our mama\u2019s expense. Now, I\u2019ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves:\r\nfor they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few\r\nyears. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift\r\nand poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside\r\nwith a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me,\r\nand I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the\r\npain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWicked and cruel boy!\u201d I said. \u201cYou are like a murderer\u2014you are like a\r\nslave-driver\u2014you are like the Roman emperors!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had read Goldsmith\u2019s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero,\r\nCaligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought\r\nthus to have declared aloud.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! what!\u201d he cried. \u201cDid she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and\r\nGeorgiana? Won\u2019t I tell mama? but first\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed\r\nwith a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop\r\nor two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat\r\npungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I\r\nreceived him in frantic sort. I don\u2019t very well know what I did with my hands,\r\nbut he called me \u201cRat! Rat!\u201d and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza\r\nand Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon\r\nthe scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the\r\nwords\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid ever anybody see such a picture of passion!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.\u201d Four hands were\r\nimmediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.\r\n\n"}
{"4": "\nCHAPTER II\n\r\nI resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly\r\nstrengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain\r\nof me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of\r\nmyself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment\u2019s mutiny had\r\nalready rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel\r\nslave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHold her arms, Miss Abbot: she\u2019s like a mad cat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor shame! for shame!\u201d cried the lady\u2019s-maid. \u201cWhat shocking conduct, Miss\r\nEyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress\u2019s son! Your young master.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMaster! How is he my master? Am I a servant?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit\r\ndown, and think over your wickedness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had\r\nthrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two\r\npair of hands arrested me instantly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t sit still, you must be tied down,\u201d said Bessie. \u201cMiss Abbot, lend\r\nme your garters; she would break mine directly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This\r\npreparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little\r\nof the excitement out of me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take them off,\u201d I cried; \u201cI will not stir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMind you don\u2019t,\u201d said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really\r\nsubsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with\r\nfolded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my\r\nsanity.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe never did so before,\u201d at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut it was always in her,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI\u2019ve told Missis often my opinion\r\nabout the child, and Missis agreed with me. She\u2019s an underhand little thing: I\r\nnever saw a girl of her age with so much cover.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she\r\nkeeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first\r\nrecollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my\r\ndependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing,\r\nbut only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and\r\nMaster Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them. They\r\nwill have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be\r\nhumble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat we tell you is for your good,\u201d added Bessie, in no harsh voice, \u201cyou\r\nshould try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home\r\nhere; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am\r\nsure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Miss Abbot, \u201cGod will punish her: He might strike her dead in\r\nthe midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will\r\nleave her: I wouldn\u2019t have her heart for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre,\r\nwhen you are by yourself; for if you don\u2019t repent, something bad might be\r\npermitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\r\n\n\r\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never,\r\nindeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it\r\nnecessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one\r\nof the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on\r\nmassive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out\r\nlike a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds\r\nalways drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery;\r\nthe carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson\r\ncloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the\r\nwardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.\r\nOut of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up\r\nmattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.\r\nScarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the\r\nbed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a\r\npale throne.\r\n\n\r\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because\r\nremote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so\r\nseldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the\r\nmirrors and the furniture a week\u2019s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far\r\nintervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the\r\nwardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a\r\nminiature of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of\r\nthe red-room\u2014the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his last;\r\nhere he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker\u2019s men; and,\r\nsince that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent\r\nintrusion.\r\n\n\r\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a\r\nlow ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right\r\nhand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections\r\nvarying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great\r\nlooking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I\r\nwas not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I\r\ngot up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I\r\nhad to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily\r\nexplored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary\r\nhollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with\r\na white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving\r\nwhere all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like\r\none of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie\u2019s evening stories\r\nrepresented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before\r\nthe eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.\r\n\n\r\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for\r\ncomplete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was\r\nstill bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of\r\nretrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.\r\n\n\r\nAll John Reed\u2019s violent tyrannies, all his sisters\u2019 proud indifference, all his\r\nmother\u2019s aversion, all the servants\u2019 partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind\r\nlike a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I always suffering, always\r\nbrowbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why\r\nwas it useless to try to win any one\u2019s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and\r\nselfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid\r\nspite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty,\r\nher pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at\r\nher, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less\r\npunished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little\r\npea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their\r\nfruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he\r\ncalled his mother \u201cold girl,\u201d too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,\r\nsimilar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and\r\nspoiled her silk attire; and he was still \u201cher own darling.\u201d I dared commit no\r\nfault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome,\r\nsullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.\r\n\n\r\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had\r\nreproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him to\r\navert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnjust!\u2014unjust!\u201d said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into\r\nprecocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated\r\nsome strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression\u2014as\r\nrunning away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more,\r\nand letting myself die.\r\n\n\r\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain\r\nwas in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what\r\ndense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless\r\ninward question\u2014why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of\u2014I will not\r\nsay how many years, I see it clearly.\r\n\n\r\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in\r\nharmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage. If they did\r\nnot love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard\r\nwith affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a\r\nheterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in\r\npropensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding\r\nto their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at\r\ntheir treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a\r\nsanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child\u2014though equally\r\ndependent and friendless\u2014Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more\r\ncomplacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality\r\nof fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the\r\nscapegoat of the nursery.\r\n\n\r\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o\u2019clock, and the\r\nbeclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still\r\nbeating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove\r\nbehind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank.\r\nMy habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on\r\nthe embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be\r\nso; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death?\r\nThat certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the\r\nchancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told\r\ndid Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on\r\nit with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my\r\nown uncle\u2014my mother\u2019s brother\u2014that he had taken me when a parentless infant to\r\nhis house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed\r\nthat she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed\r\nprobably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as\r\nwell as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an\r\ninterloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband\u2019s\r\ndeath, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a\r\nhard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she\r\ncould not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own\r\nfamily group.\r\n\n\r\nA singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not\u2014never doubted\u2014that if Mr. Reed\r\nhad been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at\r\nthe white bed and overshadowed walls\u2014occasionally also turning a fascinated eye\r\ntowards the dimly gleaming mirror\u2014I began to recall what I had heard of dead\r\nmen, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting\r\nthe earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr.\r\nReed\u2019s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister\u2019s child, might quit its\r\nabode\u2014whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed\u2014and\r\nrise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful\r\nlest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me,\r\nor elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity.\r\nThis idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with\r\nall my might I endeavoured to stifle it\u2014I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my\r\nhair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark\r\nroom; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray\r\nfrom the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still,\r\nand this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over\r\nmy head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all\r\nlikelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but\r\nthen, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by\r\nagitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision\r\nfrom another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my\r\nears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was\r\noppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the\r\nlock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key\r\nturned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Eyre, are you ill?\u201d said Bessie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!\u201d exclaimed Abbot.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake me out! Let me go into the nursery!\u201d was my cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?\u201d again demanded Bessie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.\u201d I had now got hold of\r\nBessie\u2019s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has screamed out on purpose,\u201d declared Abbot, in some disgust. \u201cAnd what a\r\nscream! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only\r\nwanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came\r\nalong the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily. \u201cAbbot and\r\nBessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room\r\ntill I came to her myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Jane screamed so loud, ma\u2019am,\u201d pleaded Bessie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d was the only answer. \u201cLoose Bessie\u2019s hand, child: you cannot\r\nsucceed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor artifice,\r\nparticularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not\r\nanswer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of\r\nperfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cO aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it\u2014let me be punished some\r\nother way! I shall be killed if\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSilence! This violence is all most repulsive:\u201d and so, no doubt, she felt it.\r\nI was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on me as a\r\ncompound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.\r\n\n\r\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic\r\nanguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without\r\nfarther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I\r\nsuppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.\r\n\n"}
{"5": "\nCHAPTER III\n\r\nThe next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a\r\nfrightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with\r\nthick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if\r\nmuffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an\r\nall-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became\r\naware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a\r\nsitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld\r\nbefore. I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\r\n\n\r\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite well\r\nthat I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire. It was\r\nnight: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin\r\nin her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.\r\n\n\r\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and\r\nsecurity, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not\r\nbelonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turning from Bessie\r\n(though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for\r\ninstance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the gentleman: I knew\r\nhim; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the\r\nservants were ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, who am I?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,\r\nsmiling and saying, \u201cWe shall do very well by-and-by.\u201d Then he laid me down,\r\nand addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed\r\nduring the night. Having given some further directions, and intimated that he\r\nshould call again the next day, he departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered\r\nand befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the\r\ndoor after him, all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible\r\nsadness weighed it down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?\u201d asked Bessie, rather softly.\r\n\n\r\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be rough. \u201cI\r\nwill try.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to drink, or could you eat anything?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you, Bessie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o\u2019clock; but you may\r\ncall me if you want anything in the night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you\u2019ll be better soon,\r\nno doubt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie went into the housemaid\u2019s apartment, which was near. I heard her say\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren\u2019t for my life be alone\r\nwith that poor child to-night: she might die; it\u2019s such a strange thing she\r\nshould have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis was rather too\r\nhard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together\r\nfor half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of their\r\nconversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main\r\nsubject discussed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSomething passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished\u201d\u2014\u201cA great black dog\r\nbehind him\u201d\u2014\u201cThree loud raps on the chamber door\u201d\u2014\u201cA light in the churchyard\r\njust over his grave,\u201d &c., &c.\r\n\n\r\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the watches of\r\nthat long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike\r\nstrained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.\r\n\n\r\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room;\r\nit only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day.\r\nYes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I\r\nought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my\r\nheart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.\r\n\n\r\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the\r\nnursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment\r\nwas an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from\r\nme silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another\r\nfollowed. Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds\r\nwere there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too,\r\nwas sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither,\r\nputting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a\r\nword of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a\r\nparadise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and\r\nthankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that\r\nno calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.\r\n\n\r\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart on a\r\ncertain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a\r\nwreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most\r\nenthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be\r\nallowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always\r\nhitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now\r\nplaced on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate\r\npastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and\r\noften wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the\r\nbird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and\r\ntart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a\r\ntransient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver\u2019s Travels from the\r\nlibrary. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it\r\na narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what\r\nI found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among\r\nfoxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling\r\nold wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they\r\nwere all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder\r\nand thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag\r\nbeing, in my creed, solid parts of the earth\u2019s surface, I doubted not that I\r\nmight one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,\r\nhouses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of\r\nthe one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the\r\nmonster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this\r\ncherished volume was now placed in my hand\u2014when I turned over its leaves, and\r\nsought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to\r\nfind\u2014all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies\r\nmalevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread\r\nand dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and\r\nput it on the table, beside the untasted tart.\r\n\n\r\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed her\r\nhands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and\r\nsatin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana\u2019s doll. Meantime she sang:\r\nher song was\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the days when we went gipsying,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A long time ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie\r\nhad a sweet voice,\u2014at least, I thought so. But now, though her voice was still\r\nsweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied\r\nwith her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; \u201cA long time\r\nago\u201d came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into\r\nanother ballad, this time a really doleful one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\r\nSoon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\r\nWhy did they send me so far and so lonely,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\r\nMen are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watch o\u2019er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\r\nYet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\r\nGod, in His mercy, protection is showing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\r\nEv\u2019n should I fall o\u2019er the broken bridge passing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\r\nStill will my Father, with promise and blessing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\r\nThere is a thought that for strength should avail me,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\r\nHeaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0God is a friend to the poor orphan child.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Miss Jane, don\u2019t cry,\u201d said Bessie as she finished. She might as well\r\nhave said to the fire, \u201cdon\u2019t burn!\u201d but how could she divine the morbid\r\nsuffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came\r\nagain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat, already up!\u201d said he, as he entered the nursery. \u201cWell, nurse, how is\r\nshe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane,\r\nis it not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, Jane Eyre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have\r\nyou any pain?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the\r\ncarriage,\u201d interposed Bessie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I\r\nanswered promptly, \u201cI never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out\r\nin the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh fie, Miss!\u201d said Bessie.\r\n\n\r\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before him; he\r\nfixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey; not very\r\nbright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a hard-featured\r\nyet good-natured looking face. Having considered me at leisure, he said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat made you ill yesterday?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe had a fall,\u201d said Bessie, again putting in her word.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFall! why, that is like a baby again! Can\u2019t she manage to walk at her age? She\r\nmust be eight or nine years old.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was knocked down,\u201d was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by another\r\npang of mortified pride; \u201cbut that did not make me ill,\u201d I added; while Mr.\r\nLloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\r\n\n\r\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the\r\nservants\u2019 dinner; he knew what it was. \u201cThat\u2019s for you, nurse,\u201d said he; \u201cyou\r\ncan go down; I\u2019ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because punctuality\r\nat meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe fall did not make you ill; what did, then?\u201d pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie\r\nwas gone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGhost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf Mr. Reed\u2019s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.\r\nNeither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it;\r\nand it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,\u2014so cruel that I think I\r\nshall never forget it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in\r\ndaylight?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: but night will come again before long: and besides,\u2014I am unhappy,\u2014very\r\nunhappy, for other things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat other things? Can you tell me some of them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was to\r\nframe any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings;\r\nand if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to\r\nexpress the result of the process in words. Fearful, however, of losing this\r\nfirst and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a\r\ndisturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true\r\nresponse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have a kind aunt and cousins.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?\u201d asked he. \u201cAre you not\r\nvery thankful to have such a fine place to live at?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a\r\nservant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh! you can\u2019t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never\r\nget away from Gateshead till I am a woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you may\u2014who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone belonging to your father?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might have some\r\npoor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you had such, would you like to go to them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children:\r\nthey have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; they\r\nthink of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless\r\ngrates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with\r\ndegradation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; I should not like to belong to poor people,\u201d was my reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot even if they were kind to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind;\r\nand then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated,\r\nto grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or\r\nwashing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I\r\nwas not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly set: I\r\nshould not like to go a begging.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to go to school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes spoke of\r\nit as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were\r\nexpected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated his school, and\r\nabused his master; but John Reed\u2019s tastes were no rule for mine, and if\r\nBessie\u2019s accounts of school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a\r\nfamily where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling,\r\nher details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies\r\nwere, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of\r\nlandscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces\r\nthey could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could\r\ntranslate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school\r\nwould be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation\r\nfrom Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should indeed like to go to school,\u201d was the audible conclusion of my\r\nmusings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, well! who knows what may happen?\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up. \u201cThe\r\nchild ought to have change of air and scene,\u201d he added, speaking to himself;\r\n\u201cnerves not in a good state.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the\r\ngravel-walk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that your mistress, nurse?\u201d asked Mr. Lloyd. \u201cI should like to speak to her\r\nbefore I go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the\r\ninterview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from\r\nafter-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to\r\nschool; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as\r\nAbbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the\r\nnursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, \u201cMissis\r\nwas, she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned\r\nchild, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots\r\nunderhand.\u201d Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy\r\nFawkes.\r\n\n\r\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot\u2019s\r\ncommunications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that my\r\nmother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the\r\nmatch beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her\r\ndisobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and\r\nfather had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while\r\nvisiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was\r\nsituated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the\r\ninfection from him, and both died within a month of each other.\r\n\n\r\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, \u201cPoor Miss Jane is to\r\nbe pitied, too, Abbot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d responded Abbot; \u201cif she were a nice, pretty child, one might\r\ncompassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little\r\ntoad as that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a great deal, to be sure,\u201d agreed Bessie: \u201cat any rate, a beauty like Miss\r\nGeorgiana would be more moving in the same condition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!\u201d cried the fervent Abbot. \u201cLittle darling!\u2014with\r\nher long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as\r\nif she were painted!\u2014Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo could I\u2014with a roast onion. Come, we\u2019ll go down.\u201d They went.\r\n\n"}
{"6": "\nCHAPTER IV\n\r\nFrom my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference\r\nbetween Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for\r\nwishing to get well: a change seemed near,\u2014I desired and waited it in silence.\r\nIt tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of\r\nhealth, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs.\r\nReed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my\r\nillness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me\r\nand her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,\r\ncondemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery,\r\nwhile my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did\r\nshe drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that\r\nshe would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now\r\nmore than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted\r\naversion.\r\n\n\r\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as\r\nlittle as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and\r\nonce attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by\r\nthe same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my\r\ncorruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me uttering\r\nexecrations, and vowing I had burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that\r\nprominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw\r\nthat either that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to\r\nfollow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard\r\nhim in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how \u201cthat nasty Jane Eyre\u201d had\r\nflown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not\r\nworthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should\r\nassociate with her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all\r\ndeliberating on my words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are not fit to associate with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious\r\ndeclaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the\r\nnursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic\r\nvoice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of\r\nthe day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?\u201d was my scarcely voluntary\r\ndemand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced\r\nwords without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me\r\nover which I had no control.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye\r\nbecame troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed\r\nat me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend. I was now in\r\nfor it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa\r\nand mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both\r\nmy ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a\r\nhomily of an hour\u2019s length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the\r\nmost wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her;\r\nfor I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.\r\n\n\r\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year\r\nhad been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had\r\nbeen interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment I\r\nwas, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the\r\ndaily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the\r\ndrawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair\r\nelaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano\r\nor the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman,\r\nto the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\r\nhum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of\r\nthis occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent\r\nnursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had\r\nnot the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely\r\nnoticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have\r\ndeemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing\r\nthem under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and\r\ngentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to\r\ntake herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper\u2019s room,\r\ngenerally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee\r\ntill the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing\r\nworse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull\r\nred, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and\r\nsought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I always took my\r\ndoll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects\r\nof affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded\r\ngraven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember\r\nwith what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive\r\nand capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my\r\nnight-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy,\r\nbelieving it to be happy likewise.\r\n\n\r\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and\r\nlistened for the sound of Bessie\u2019s step on the stairs: sometimes she would come\r\nup in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me\r\nsomething by way of supper\u2014a bun or a cheese-cake\u2014then she would sit on the bed\r\nwhile I ate it, and when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me,\r\nand twice she kissed me, and said, \u201cGood night, Miss Jane.\u201d When thus gentle,\r\nBessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I\r\nwished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and\r\nnever push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often\r\nwont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural\r\ncapacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of\r\nnarrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery\r\ntales. She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are\r\ncorrect. I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very\r\nnice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty\r\ntemper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was,\r\nI preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.\r\n\n\r\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o\u2019clock in the morning: Bessie was\r\ngone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama;\r\nEliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her\r\npoultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the\r\neggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a\r\nturn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the\r\nvending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the\r\ngardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary\r\nhaving orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her\r\nparterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if\r\nshe could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first\r\nsecreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of\r\nthese hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day\r\nlosing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a\r\nusurious rate of interest\u2014fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted\r\nevery quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\r\n\n\r\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving\r\nher curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a\r\nstore in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, having received strict\r\norders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now\r\nfrequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust\r\nthe chairs, &c.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went\r\nto the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll\u2019s house\r\nfurniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her\r\nplaythings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups,\r\nwere her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other\r\noccupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was\r\nfretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out\r\non the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard\r\nfrost.\r\n\n\r\nFrom this window were visible the porter\u2019s lodge and the carriage-road, and\r\njust as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes\r\nas left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll\r\nthrough. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often\r\ncame to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it\r\nstopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was\r\nadmitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier\r\nattraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped\r\non the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the\r\ncasement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and\r\nhaving crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the\r\ncrumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you washed\r\nyour hands and face this morning?\u201d I gave another tug before I answered, for I\r\nwanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the\r\ncrumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing\r\nthe window, I replied\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTroublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look quite red,\r\nas if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry\r\nto listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a\r\nmerciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a\r\ncoarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my\r\npinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down\r\ndirectly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\r\n\n\r\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there;\r\nbut Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me. I slowly\r\ndescended. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed\u2019s\r\npresence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and\r\ndrawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to\r\nintrude.\r\n\n\r\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I\r\nstopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little poltroon had fear,\r\nengendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days! I feared to return\r\nto the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in\r\nagitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided\r\nme; I must enter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho could want me?\u201d I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff\r\ndoor-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. \u201cWhat should I\r\nsee besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?\u2014a man or a woman?\u201d The handle turned,\r\nthe door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at\u2014a\r\nblack pillar!\u2014such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight,\r\nnarrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top\r\nwas like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to\r\napproach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words:\r\n\u201cThis is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.\u201d\r\n\n\nHe, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and\r\nhaving examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled\r\nunder a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, \u201cHer size is\r\nsmall: what is her age?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTen years.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo much?\u201d was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some\r\nminutes. Presently he addressed me\u2014\u201cYour name, little girl?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane Eyre, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then\r\nI was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his\r\nframe were equally harsh and prim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary\r\nopinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the\r\nhead, adding soon, \u201cPerhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;\u201d and bending from the\r\nperpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed\u2019s.\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him. What a\r\nface he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose!\r\nand what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo sight so sad as that of a naughty child,\u201d he began, \u201cespecially a naughty\r\nlittle girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey go to hell,\u201d was my ready and orthodox answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what is hell? Can you tell me that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA pit full of fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat must you do to avoid it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: \u201cI must\r\nkeep in good health, and not die.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried\r\na little child of five years old only a day or two since,\u2014a good little child,\r\nwhose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of\r\nyou were you to be called hence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the\r\ntwo large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been\r\nthe occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBenefactress! benefactress!\u201d said I inwardly: \u201cthey all call Mrs. Reed my\r\nbenefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you say your prayers night and morning?\u201d continued my interrogator.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you read your Bible?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith pleasure? Are you fond of it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a\r\nlittle bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and\r\nJonah.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the Psalms? I hope you like them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms\r\nby heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to\r\neat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: \u2018Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels\r\nsing Psalms;\u2019 says he, \u2018I wish to be a little angel here below;\u2019 he then gets\r\ntwo nuts in recompense for his infant piety.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPsalms are not interesting,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to\r\ngive you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a\r\nheart of flesh.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation\r\nof changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me\r\nto sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you\r\nthree weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and\r\ndisposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be\r\nglad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on\r\nher, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I\r\nmention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to\r\nwound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I\r\nobeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still\r\nrepulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered before a\r\nstranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was\r\nalready obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me\r\nto enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was\r\nsowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed\r\nunder Mr. Brocklehurst\u2019s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do\r\nto remedy the injury?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, indeed,\u201d thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily\r\nwiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDeceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst; \u201cit is akin\r\nto falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with\r\nfire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to\r\nMiss Temple and the teachers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,\u201d\r\ncontinued my benefactress; \u201cto be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the\r\nvacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,\u201d returned Mr. Brocklehurst.\r\n\u201cHumility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of\r\nLowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its\r\ncultivation amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the\r\nworldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of\r\nmy success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the\r\nschool, and on her return she exclaimed: \u2018Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain\r\nall the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and\r\ntheir long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their\r\nfrocks\u2014they are almost like poor people\u2019s children! and,\u2019 said she, \u2018they\r\nlooked at my dress and mama\u2019s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is the state of things I quite approve,\u201d returned Mrs. Reed; \u201chad I\r\nsought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly\r\nfitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I\r\nadvocate consistency in all things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConsistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed\r\nin every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare,\r\nsimple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is\r\nthe order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil\r\nat Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and\r\nprospects?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I\r\ntrust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her\r\nelection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure\r\nyou, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too\r\nirksome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall return to\r\nBrocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the\r\nArchdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple\r\nnotice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty\r\nabout receiving her. Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to\r\nAugusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the \u2018Child\u2019s Guide\u2019; read\r\nit with prayer, especially that part containing \u2018An account of the awfully\r\nsudden death of Martha G\u2014\u2014, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a\r\ncover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was\r\nsewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven\r\nand thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and\r\nstrong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large\r\nface, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her\r\nchin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light\r\neyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her\r\nhair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell\u2014illness never came\r\nnear her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were\r\nthoroughly under her control; her children only at times defied her authority\r\nand laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port\r\ncalculated to set off handsome attire.\r\n\n\r\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her figure;\r\nI perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death\r\nof the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an\r\nappropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning\r\nme to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw,\r\nand stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it\r\nplainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the\r\nsame time suspended their nimble movements.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo out of the room; return to the nursery,\u201d was her mandate. My look or\r\nsomething else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme\r\nthough suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again;\r\nI walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.\r\n\n\nSpeak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but\r\nhow? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I gathered my\r\nenergies and launched them in this blunt sentence\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare\r\nI do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John\r\nReed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for\r\nit is she who tells lies, and not I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Reed\u2019s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice continued to\r\ndwell freezingly on mine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat more have you to say?\u201d she asked, rather in the tone in which a person\r\nmight address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a\r\nchild.\r\n\n\r\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head\r\nto foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as\r\nlong as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one\r\nasks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of\r\nyou makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I\r\nhave no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I\r\ncannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me\r\nback\u2014roughly and violently thrust me back\u2014into the red-room, and locked me up\r\nthere, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while\r\nsuffocating with distress, \u2018Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!\u2019 And that\r\npunishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me\u2014knocked me down\r\nfor nothing. I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People\r\nthink you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are\r\ndeceitful!\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the\r\nstrangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an\r\ninvisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for\r\nliberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her\r\nwork had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking herself\r\nto and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you tremble\r\nso violently? Would you like to drink some water?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Mrs. Reed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your\r\nfriend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful\r\ndisposition; and I\u2019ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you\r\nhave done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you don\u2019t understand these things: children must be corrected for their\r\nfaults.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDeceit is not my fault!\u201d I cried out in a savage, high voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the\r\nnursery\u2014there\u2019s a dear\u2014and lie down a little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for\r\nI hate to live here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will indeed send her to school soon,\u201d murmured Mrs. Reed sotto voce;\r\nand gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\r\n\n\r\nI was left there alone\u2014winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had\r\nfought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where\r\nMr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror\u2019s solitude. First, I\r\nsmiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as\r\nfast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its\r\nelders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I\r\nhad given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the\r\nchill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would\r\nhave been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the\r\nsame ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented\r\nas meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour\u2019s silence and reflection\r\nhad shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and\r\nhating position.\r\n\n\r\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it\r\nseemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and\r\ncorroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now\r\nhave gone and asked Mrs. Reed\u2019s pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and\r\npartly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double\r\nscorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.\r\n\n\r\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain\r\nfind nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre\r\nindignation. I took a book\u2014some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to\r\nread. I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between\r\nme and the page I had usually found fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the\r\nbreakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned,\r\nunbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with\r\nthe skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which\r\nwas quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the\r\nfalling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past\r\nwinds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked\r\ninto an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was\r\nnipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, \u201conding on\r\nsnaw,\u201d canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard\r\npath and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough,\r\nwhispering to myself over and over again, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u2014what shall I do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, \u201cMiss Jane! where are you? Come to\r\nlunch!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came\r\ntripping down the path.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou naughty little thing!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come when you are called?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie\u2019s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding,\r\nseemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is,\r\nafter my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care\r\nmuch for the nursemaid\u2019s transitory anger; and I was disposed to bask in\r\nher youthful lightness of heart. I just put my two arms round her and said,\r\n\u201cCome, Bessie! don\u2019t scold.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in:\r\nsomehow it pleased her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are a strange child, Miss Jane,\u201d she said, as she looked down at me; \u201ca\r\nlittle roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd won\u2019t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be\r\nbolder.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! to get more knocks?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! But you are rather put upon, that\u2019s certain. My mother said, when\r\nshe came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own\r\nto be in your place.\u2014Now, come in, and I\u2019ve some good news for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have, Bessie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChild! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but Missis\r\nand the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and\r\nyou shall have tea with me. I\u2019ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then\r\nyou shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk.\r\nMissis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose\r\nwhat toys you like to take with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don\u2019t be afraid of me.\r\nDon\u2019t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it\u2019s so provoking.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got\r\nused to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you dread them they\u2019ll dislike you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs you do, Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the\r\nothers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t show it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou little sharp thing! you\u2019ve got quite a new way of talking. What makes you\r\nso venturesome and hardy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I shall soon be away from you, and besides\u201d\u2014I was going to say something\r\nabout what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I\r\nconsidered it better to remain silent on that head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you\u2019re glad to leave me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I\u2019m rather sorry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say now if I\r\nwere to ask you for a kiss you wouldn\u2019t give it me: you\u2019d say you\u2019d\r\nrather not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.\u201d Bessie stooped; we mutually\r\nembraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted. That afternoon\r\nlapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most\r\nenchanting stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life\r\nhad its gleams of sunshine.\r\n\n"}
{"7": "\nCHAPTER V\n\r\nFive o\u2019clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when\r\nBessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly\r\ndressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face,\r\nand put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays\r\nstreamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that\r\nday by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie\r\nwas the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now\r\nproceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the\r\nthoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a\r\nfew spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up\r\nsome biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with\r\nmy pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the\r\nnursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed\u2019s bedroom, she said, \u201cWill you go in and bid\r\nMissis good-bye?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper,\r\nand said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she\r\ntold me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of\r\nher and be grateful to her accordingly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say, Miss?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the\r\nwall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat was wrong, Miss Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been\r\nmy foe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cO Miss Jane! don\u2019t say so!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye to Gateshead!\u201d cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at\r\nthe front door.\r\n\n\r\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light\r\nglanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was\r\nthe winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was\r\na light in the porter\u2019s lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter\u2019s wife\r\njust kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening\r\nbefore, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and\r\nshortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the\r\ncoming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through\r\nthe gloom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she going by herself?\u201d asked the porter\u2019s wife.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how far is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFifty miles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top\r\nladen with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was\r\nhoisted up; I was taken from Bessie\u2019s neck, to which I clung with kisses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe sure and take good care of her,\u201d cried she to the guard, as he lifted me\r\ninto the inside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay!\u201d was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed \u201cAll\r\nright,\u201d and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus\r\nwhirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.\r\n\n\r\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of\r\na preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles\r\nof road. We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the\r\ncoach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.\r\nI was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but,\r\nas I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each\r\nend, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up\r\nagainst the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a\r\nlong time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming\r\nin and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\r\nfrequently figured in Bessie\u2019s fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned;\r\nonce more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat,\r\nsounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the \u201cstony street\u201d of L\u2014\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to\r\nfeel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass\r\nthrough towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the\r\nhorizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long\r\nafter night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst\r\ntrees.\r\n\n\r\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when\r\nthe sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open, and a person\r\nlike a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the\r\nlamps.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?\u201d she asked. I answered \u201cYes,\u201d\r\nand was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly\r\ndrove away.\r\n\n\r\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the\r\ncoach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, and darkness\r\nfilled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door\r\nopen in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked\r\nit behind her. There was now visible a house or houses\u2014for the building spread\r\nfar\u2014with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly\r\npath, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me\r\nthrough a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.\r\n\n\r\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there\r\nwas no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals,\r\npapered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour,\r\nnot so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable\r\nenough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when\r\nthe door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed\r\nclose behind.\r\n\n\r\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large\r\nforehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was\r\ngrave, her bearing erect.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe child is very young to be sent alone,\u201d said she, putting her candle down\r\non the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further\r\nadded\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?\u201d she asked,\r\nplacing her hand on my shoulder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed,\r\nMiss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to\r\nschool, my little girl?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been\r\ndead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and\r\nsew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying,\r\n\u201cShe hoped I should be a good child,\u201d dismissed me along with Miss Miller.\r\n\n\r\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me\r\nappeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and\r\nair. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn\r\ncountenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity\r\nof tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was,\r\nan under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from\r\npassage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the\r\ntotal and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had\r\ntraversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide,\r\nlong room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a\r\npair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of\r\nevery age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their\r\nnumber to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they\r\nwere uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long\r\nholland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over\r\ntheir to-morrow\u2019s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of\r\ntheir whispered repetitions.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to\r\nthe top of the long room she cried out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the\r\nbooks and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonitors, fetch the supper-trays!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with\r\nportions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of\r\nwater and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were handed round; those\r\nwho liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all. When it\r\ncame to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food,\r\nexcitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however,\r\nthat it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.\r\n\n\r\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two\r\nand two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed\r\nwhat sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw\r\nit was very long. To-night I was to be Miss Miller\u2019s bed-fellow; she helped me\r\nto undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which\r\nwas quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was\r\nextinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\r\n\n\r\nThe night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to\r\nhear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be\r\nsensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again unclosed\r\nmy eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not\r\nyet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose\r\nreluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for\r\nshivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur\r\nsoon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of\r\nthe room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that\r\norder descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here\r\nprayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cForm classes!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly\r\nexclaimed, \u201cSilence!\u201d and \u201cOrder!\u201d When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in\r\nfour semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books\r\nin their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the\r\nvacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum\r\nof numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite\r\nsound.\r\n\n\r\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked\r\nto a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair,\r\nwhich was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children\r\nwere assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom\r\nof it.\r\n\n\r\nBusiness now began: the day\u2019s Collect was repeated, then certain texts of\r\nScripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in\r\nthe Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated, day\r\nhad fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the\r\nclasses were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I\r\nwas to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick\r\nfrom inanition, having taken so little the day before.\r\n\n\r\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked\r\nbasins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far\r\nfrom inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of\r\nthe repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of\r\nthe procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDisgusting! The porridge is burnt again!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper\r\nteachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose\r\naspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady\r\npresided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night\r\nbefore; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I\r\nsat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I\r\nafterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace\r\nwas said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers,\r\nand the meal began.\r\n\n\r\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion\r\nwithout thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I\r\nperceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as\r\nrotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons were moved\r\nslowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases\r\nthe effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted.\r\nThanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the\r\nrefectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out,\r\nand in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and\r\ntaste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed\r\ndispleasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbominable stuff! How shameful!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the\r\nschoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be\r\npermitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege. The\r\nwhole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor\r\nthings! it was the sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only\r\nteacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with\r\nserious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by\r\nsome lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no\r\ngreat effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\r\n\n\r\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and\r\nstanding in the middle of the room, cried\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSilence! To your seats!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into\r\norder, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper\r\nteachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait.\r\nRanged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless\r\nand erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from\r\ntheir faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by\r\na narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped\r\nsomething like a Highlander\u2019s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and\r\ndestined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen\r\nstockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of\r\nthose clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it\r\nsuited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.\r\n\n\r\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers\u2014none\r\nof whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark\r\none not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller,\r\npoor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked\u2014when, as my eye\r\nwandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved\r\nby a common spring.\r\n\n\r\nWhat was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had\r\ngathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now\r\nturned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the\r\npersonage who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long\r\nroom, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two\r\nrows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her\r\na question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said\r\naloud\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonitor of the first class, fetch the globes!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the\r\nroom. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the\r\nsense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad\r\ndaylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light\r\nin their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the\r\nwhiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark\r\nbrown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times,\r\nwhen neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in\r\nthe mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish\r\ntrimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now)\r\nshone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined\r\nfeatures; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he\r\nwill have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the\r\nexterior of Miss Temple\u2014Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a\r\nprayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.\r\n\n\r\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat\r\nbefore a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class\r\nround her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were\r\ncalled by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for\r\nan hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss\r\nTemple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by\r\nthe clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a word to address to the pupils,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at\r\nher voice. She went on\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be\r\nhungry:\u2014I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is to be done on my responsibility,\u201d she added, in an explanatory tone to\r\nthem, and immediately afterwards left the room.\r\n\n\r\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high\r\ndelight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now given \u201cTo the\r\ngarden!\u201d Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico,\r\nand a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the\r\nstream, I made my way into the open air.\r\n\n\r\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude\r\nevery glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad\r\nwalks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds\r\nwere assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an\r\nowner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the\r\nlatter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I\r\nstood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not\r\npositively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was\r\nstill soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls\r\nran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded\r\ntogether for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the\r\ndense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound\r\nof a hollow cough.\r\n\n\r\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I\r\nstood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did\r\nnot oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey\r\nmantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without,\r\nand the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the\r\nemployment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and\r\nfragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my\r\npast life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was\r\nvague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round\r\nthe convent-like garden, and then up at the house\u2014a large building, half of\r\nwhich seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing\r\nthe schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which\r\ngave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this\r\ninscription:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nLOWOOD INSTITUTION.\n\r\nThis portion was rebuilt A.D. \u2014\u2014, by Naomi Brocklehurst,\r\nof Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\n\r\n\u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and\r\nglorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d\u2014St. Matt. v. 16.\r\n\n\r\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to\r\nthem, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was still pondering the\r\nsignification of \u201cInstitution,\u201d and endeavouring to make out a connection\r\nbetween the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough\r\nclose behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench\r\nnear; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from\r\nwhere I stood I could see the title\u2014it was \u201cRasselas;\u201d a name that struck me as\r\nstrange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look\r\nup, and I said to her directly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs your book interesting?\u201d I had already formed the intention of asking her to\r\nlend it to me some day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI like it,\u201d she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she\r\nexamined me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus\r\nto open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and\r\nhabits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I\r\ntoo liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest\r\nor comprehend the serious or substantial.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may look at it,\u201d replied the girl, offering me the book.\r\n\n\r\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking\r\nthan the title: \u201cRasselas\u201d looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing\r\nabout fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the\r\nclosely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and\r\nwithout saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood:\r\nagain I ventured to disturb her\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is\r\nLowood Institution?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis house where you are come to live.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other\r\nschools?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are\r\ncharity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or\r\nyour mother dead?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoth died before I can remember.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is\r\ncalled an institution for educating orphans.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen why do they call us charity-children?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the\r\ndeficiency is supplied by subscription.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho subscribes?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDifferent benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in\r\nLondon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho was Naomi Brocklehurst?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and\r\nwhose son overlooks and directs everything here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who\r\nsaid we were to have some bread and cheese?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst\r\nfor all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes he live here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014two miles off, at a large hall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he a good man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are the other teachers called?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work, and\r\ncuts out\u2014for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything;\r\nthe little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and\r\ngrammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl,\r\nand has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame\r\nPierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like the teachers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell enough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like the little black one, and the Madame \u2014\u2014?\u2014I cannot pronounce her\r\nname as you do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Scatcherd is hasty\u2014you must take care not to offend her; Madame Pierrot\r\nis not a bad sort of person.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Miss Temple is the best\u2014isn\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she\r\nknows far more than they do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you been long here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwo years.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you an orphan?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy mother is dead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you happy here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for the\r\npresent: now I want to read.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house.\r\nThe odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that\r\nwhich had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge\r\ntin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found\r\nthe mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat,\r\nmixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful\r\nwas apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself\r\nwhether every day\u2019s fare would be like this.\r\n\n\r\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced,\r\nand were continued till five o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had\r\nconversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a\r\nhistory class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The\r\npunishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a\r\ngirl\u2014she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great\r\ndistress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed,\r\nthough grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. \u201cHow can she bear it so\r\nquietly\u2014so firmly?\u201d I asked of myself. \u201cWere I in her place, it seems to me I\r\nshould wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were\r\nthinking of something beyond her punishment\u2014beyond her situation: of something\r\nnot round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams\u2014is she in a day-dream\r\nnow? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it\u2014her\r\nsight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can\r\nremember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a\r\ngirl she is\u2014whether good or naughty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small\r\nmug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank\r\nmy coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more\u2014I was still\r\nhungry. Half-an-hour\u2019s recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of\r\nwater and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at\r\nLowood.\r\n\n"}
{"8": "\nCHAPTER VI\n\r\nThe next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but\r\nthis morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the\r\nwater in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the\r\npreceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices\r\nof our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and\r\nturned the contents of the ewers to ice.\r\n\n\r\nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt\r\nready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the\r\nporridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small\r\nmy portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and\r\nregular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a\r\nspectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein.\r\nAt first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me\r\nboth long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered\r\nme; and I was glad when, about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put\r\ninto my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble,\r\n&c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with\r\ndirections to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing\r\nlikewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd\u2019s chair reading, and\r\nas all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with\r\nthe manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or\r\ncommendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history:\r\namong the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the\r\ncommencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for\r\nsome error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly\r\nsent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd\r\ncontinued to make her an object of constant notice: she was continually\r\naddressing to her such phrases as the following:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBurns\u201d (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their\r\nsurnames, as boys are elsewhere), \u201cBurns, you are standing on the side of your\r\nshoe; turn your toes out immediately.\u201d \u201cBurns, you poke your chin most\r\nunpleasantly; draw it in.\u201d \u201cBurns, I insist on your holding your head up; I\r\nwill not have you before me in that attitude,\u201d &c. &c.\r\n\n\r\nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls\r\nexamined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I., and there\r\nwere sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of\r\nthem appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved\r\ninstantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the\r\nsubstance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I\r\nkept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of\r\nthat, she suddenly cried out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this morning!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d thought I, \u201cdoes she not explain that she could neither clean her nails\r\nnor wash her face, as the water was frozen?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of\r\nthread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking\r\nwhether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit,\r\n&c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss\r\nScatcherd\u2019s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just\r\ndelivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately\r\nleft the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept,\r\nreturned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together\r\nat one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful\r\ncurtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and\r\nthe teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with\r\nthe bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns\u2019 eye; and, while I paused from my\r\nsewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of\r\nunavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its\r\nordinary expression.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHardened girl!\u201d exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; \u201cnothing can correct you of your\r\nslatternly habits: carry the rod away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she\r\nwas just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear\r\nglistened on her thin cheek.\r\n\n\r\nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at\r\nLowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o\u2019clock had\r\nrevived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day\r\nwas slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning\u2014its fires being\r\nallowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place\r\nof candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the\r\nconfusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.\r\n\n\r\nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil,\r\nBurns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups\r\nwithout a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now\r\nand then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already\r\nforming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could\r\ndistinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind\r\noutside.\r\n\n\r\nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have\r\nbeen the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that\r\nwind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed\r\nmy peace! as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and\r\nfeverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to\r\ndarkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.\r\n\n\r\nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the\r\nfire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed,\r\nsilent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she\r\nread by the dim glare of the embers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it still \u2018Rasselas\u2019?\u201d I asked, coming behind her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have just finished it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d thought I, \u201cI can perhaps get her to talk.\u201d I sat down by her on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your name besides Burns?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHelen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you come a long way from here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you ever go back?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must wish to leave Lowood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of\r\nno use going away until I have attained that object.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her. If she\r\nstruck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should break it under\r\nher nose.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProbably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst\r\nwould expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations.\r\nIt is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself,\r\nthan to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all\r\nconnected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the\r\nmiddle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far\r\nyounger than you, and I could not bear it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak\r\nand silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to\r\nbear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and\r\nstill less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed\r\nfor her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light\r\ninvisible to my eyes. I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I would\r\nnot ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient\r\nseason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said,\r\nslatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in order; I am careless; I\r\nforget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and\r\nsometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be subjected to systematic\r\narrangements. This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally\r\nneat, punctual, and particular.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd cross and cruel,\u201d I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition:\r\nshe kept silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt the utterance of Miss Temple\u2019s name, a soft smile flitted over her grave\r\nface.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even\r\nthe worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and,\r\nif I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally. One strong\r\nproof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so\r\nmild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her\r\npraise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care\r\nand foresight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is curious,\u201d said I, \u201cit is so easy to be careful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this\r\nmorning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to\r\nwander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine\r\ncontinually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and\r\ncollecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her\r\nvoice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland,\r\nand that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which\r\nruns through Deepden, near our house;\u2014then, when it comes to my turn to reply,\r\nI have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening\r\nto the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet how well you replied this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested\r\nme. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man\r\nwho wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First\r\nsometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and\r\nconscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown.\r\nIf he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the\r\nspirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles\u2014I respect him\u2014I pity him,\r\npoor murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had\r\nno right to shed. How dared they kill him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHelen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well\r\nunderstand her\u2014that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she discussed.\r\nI recalled her to my level.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say\r\nwhich is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to\r\nme, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, with Miss Temple you are good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides me.\r\nThere is no merit in such goodness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever\r\ndesire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel\r\nand unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never\r\nfeel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.\r\nWhen we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard;\r\nI am sure we should\u2014so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a\r\nlittle untaught girl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please\r\nthem, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly. It\r\nis as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to\r\npunishment when I feel it is deserved.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised\r\nnations disown it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not violence that best overcomes hate\u2014nor vengeance that most certainly\r\nheals injury.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRead the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make\r\nHis word your rule, and His conduct your example.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does He say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLove your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you\r\nand despitefully use you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John,\r\nwhich is impossible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour\r\nout, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and\r\ntruculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.\r\n\n\r\nHelen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a remark,\r\nbut she said nothing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I asked impatiently, \u201cis not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your cast\r\nof character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all\r\nshe has done and said to you! What a singularly deep impression her injustice\r\nseems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my\r\nfeelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity,\r\ntogether with the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short\r\nto be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be,\r\none and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come\r\nwhen, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies;\r\nwhen debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,\r\nand only the spark of the spirit will remain,\u2014the impalpable principle of light\r\nand thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence\r\nit came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher\r\nthan man\u2014perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul\r\nto brighten to the seraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered\r\nto degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another\r\ncreed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I\r\ndelight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a\r\nrest\u2014a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can\r\nso clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely\r\nforgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries\r\nmy heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me\r\ntoo low: I live in calm, looking to the end.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHelen\u2019s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this\r\nsentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to\r\nconverse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time for meditation: a\r\nmonitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong\r\nCumberland accent\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHelen Burns, if you don\u2019t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your\r\nwork this minute, I\u2019ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHelen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor without\r\nreply as without delay.\r\n\n"}
{"9": "\nCHAPTER VII\n\r\nMy first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it\r\ncomprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new\r\nrules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse\r\nthan the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.\r\n\n\r\nDuring January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their\r\nmelting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden\r\nwalls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour\r\nevery day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the\r\nsevere cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our\r\nungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I\r\nremember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every\r\nevening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,\r\nand stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was\r\ndistressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely\r\nsufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of\r\nnourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils:\r\nwhenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace\r\nthe little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between two\r\nclaimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after\r\nrelinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have\r\nswallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me\r\nby the exigency of hunger.\r\n\n\r\nSundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two miles to\r\nBrocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived\r\nat church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed. It was\r\ntoo far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the\r\nsame penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round\r\nbetween the services.\r\n\n\r\nAt the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road,\r\nwhere the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the\r\nnorth, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\r\n\n\r\nI can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line,\r\nher plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and\r\nencouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march\r\nforward, as she said, \u201clike stalwart soldiers.\u201d The other teachers, poor\r\nthings, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of\r\ncheering others.\r\n\n\r\nHow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! But,\r\nto the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was\r\nimmediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the\r\nyounger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their\r\npinafores.\r\n\n\r\nA little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread\u2014a\r\nwhole, instead of a half, slice\u2014with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of\r\nbutter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath\r\nto Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast\r\nfor myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.\r\n\n\r\nThe Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and\r\nthe fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a\r\nlong sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her\r\nweariness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the\r\npart of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with\r\nsleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form,\r\nand be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\r\ncentre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was\r\nfinished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap;\r\nthey were then propped up with the monitors\u2019 high stools.\r\n\n\r\nI have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that\r\ngentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my\r\narrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon: his\r\nabsence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for\r\ndreading his coming: but come he did at last.\r\n\n\r\nOne afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a\r\nslate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in\r\nabstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised\r\nalmost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the\r\nschool, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to\r\nlook up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride\r\nmeasured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had\r\nrisen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from\r\nthe hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of\r\narchitecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a\r\nsurtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\r\n\n\r\nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I\r\nremembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,\r\n&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the\r\nteachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of\r\nthis promise,\u2014I had been looking out daily for the \u201cComing Man,\u201d whose\r\ninformation respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad\r\nchild for ever: now there he was.\r\n\n\r\nHe stood at Miss Temple\u2019s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt\r\nhe was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful\r\nanxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of\r\nrepugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite\r\nat the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me\r\nfrom immediate apprehension.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me\r\nthat it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the\r\nneedles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of\r\nthe darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she\r\nis not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if\r\nthey have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma\u2019am! I wish\r\nthe woollen stockings were better looked to!\u2014when I was here last, I went into\r\nthe kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a\r\nquantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the\r\nholes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour directions shall be attended to, sir,\u201d said Miss Temple.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd, ma\u2019am,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe laundress tells me some of the girls have two\r\nclean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine Johnstone\r\nwere invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave\r\nthem leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Brocklehurst nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too\r\noften. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling\r\naccounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese,\r\nhas twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight. How is this?\r\nI looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who\r\nintroduced this innovation? and by what authority?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,\u201d replied Miss Temple: \u201cthe\r\nbreakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I\r\ndared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up these\r\ngirls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to\r\nrender them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental\r\ndisappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under\r\nor the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by\r\nreplacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the\r\nbody and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the\r\nspiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude\r\nunder the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be\r\nmistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of\r\nreferring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of\r\nmartyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His\r\ndisciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall\r\nnot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of\r\nGod; to His divine consolations, \u2018If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake,\r\nhappy are ye.\u2019 Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt\r\nporridge, into these children\u2019s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies,\r\nbut you little think how you starve their immortal souls!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Brocklehurst again paused\u2014perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss Temple had\r\nlooked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight\r\nbefore her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming\r\nalso the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as\r\nif it would have required a sculptor\u2019s chisel to open it, and her brow settled\r\ngradually into petrified severity.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his\r\nback, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as\r\nif it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he\r\nsaid in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Temple, Miss Temple, what\u2014what is that girl with curled hair? Red\r\nhair, ma\u2019am, curled\u2014curled all over?\u201d And extending his cane he pointed to the\r\nawful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is Julia Severn,\u201d replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJulia Severn, ma\u2019am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why, in\r\ndefiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the\r\nworld so openly\u2014here in an evangelical, charitable establishment\u2014as to wear her\r\nhair one mass of curls?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJulia\u2019s hair curls naturally,\u201d returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNaturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be\r\nthe children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again and again intimated\r\nthat I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple,\r\nthat girl\u2019s hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and\r\nI see others who have far too much of the excrescence\u2014that tall girl, tell her\r\nto turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the\r\nwall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the\r\ninvoluntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the\r\nfirst class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a\r\nlittle back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they\r\ncommented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them\r\ntoo; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of\r\nthe cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he\r\nimagined.\r\n\n\r\nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then\r\npronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll those top-knots must be cut off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMiss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this\r\nworld: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach\r\nthem to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided\r\nhair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string\r\nof hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I\r\nrepeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now\r\nentered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his\r\nlecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.\r\nThe two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey\r\nbeaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the\r\nbrim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately\r\ncurled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with\r\nermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.\r\n\n\r\nThese ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses\r\nBrocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems\r\nthey had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been\r\nconducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted\r\nbusiness with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the\r\nsuperintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to\r\nMiss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of\r\nthe dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters\r\ncalled off and enchanted my attention.\r\n\n\r\nHitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple,\r\nI had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal\r\nsafety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.\r\nTo this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with\r\nmy sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have\r\nescaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my\r\nhand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I\r\nknew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of\r\nslate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA careless girl!\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after\u2014\u201cIt is the new\r\npupil, I perceive.\u201d And before I could draw breath, \u201cI must not forget I have a\r\nword to say respecting her.\u201d Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me! \u201cLet the\r\nchild who broke her slate come forward!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great\r\ngirls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the\r\ndread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I\r\ncaught her whispered counsel\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnother minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,\u201d thought I; and an\r\nimpulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the\r\nconviction. I was no Helen Burns.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFetch that stool,\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from\r\nwhich a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlace the child upon it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don\u2019t know: I was in no condition to note\r\nparticulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst\u2019s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot\r\norange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and\r\nwaved below me.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLadies,\u201d said he, turning to his family, \u201cMiss Temple, teachers, and children,\r\nyou all see this girl?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against\r\nmy scorched skin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of\r\nchildhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of\r\nus; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think\r\nthat the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I\r\ngrieve to say, is the case.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA pause\u2014in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the\r\nRubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly\r\nsustained.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear children,\u201d pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, \u201cthis is a\r\nsad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl,\r\nwho might be one of God\u2019s own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the\r\ntrue flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard\r\nagainst her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company,\r\nexclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers,\r\nyou must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words,\r\nscrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such\r\nsalvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this\r\nchild, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who\r\nsays its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut\u2014this girl is\u2014a liar!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect\r\npossession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their\r\npocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady\r\nswayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, \u201cHow shocking!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Brocklehurst resumed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who\r\nadopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose\r\nkindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so\r\ndreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from\r\nher own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their\r\npurity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their\r\ndiseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg\r\nof you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his\r\nsurtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and\r\nthen all the great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the door,\r\nmy judge said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her\r\nduring the remainder of the day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of\r\nstanding on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to\r\ngeneral view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were, no language can\r\ndescribe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my\r\nthroat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a\r\nstrange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent\r\nthrough me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had\r\npassed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the\r\nrising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen\r\nBurns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for\r\nthe triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she\r\nagain went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the\r\neffluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments,\r\nher thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an\r\nangel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm \u201cthe untidy badge;\u201d\r\nscarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of\r\nbread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it\r\nout. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of\r\nthe clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd\u2019s can only see those minute\r\ndefects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.\r\n\n"}
{"10": "\nCHAPTER VIII\n\r\nEre the half-hour ended, five o\u2019clock struck; school was dismissed, and all\r\nwere gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep\r\ndusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I\r\nhad been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so\r\noverwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the\r\nground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to\r\nmyself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be\r\nso good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect\r\nand win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had\r\nreached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple\r\nhad smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me\r\nlearn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and\r\nthen I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of\r\nmy own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden\r\non; and could I ever rise more?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out this wish\r\nin broken accents, some one approached: I started up\u2014again Helen Burns was near\r\nme; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant room; she\r\nbrought my coffee and bread.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, eat something,\u201d she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a\r\ndrop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition. Helen regarded\r\nme, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried\r\nhard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced\r\nher knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she\r\nremained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHelen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEverybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called\r\nso, and the world contains hundreds of millions.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what have I to do with millions? The eighty I know despise me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or\r\ndislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is\r\nlittle liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had he treated\r\nyou as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert,\r\nall around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they\r\ndared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but\r\nfriendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing\r\nwell, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their\r\ntemporary suppression. Besides, Jane\u201d\u2014she paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Helen?\u201d said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently\r\nto warm them, and went on\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience\r\napproved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others\r\ndon\u2019t love me I would rather die than live\u2014I cannot bear to be solitary and\r\nhated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple,\r\nor any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my\r\narm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and\r\nlet it dash its hoof at my chest\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too\r\nimpulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put\r\nlife into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or\r\nthan creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men,\r\nthere is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us,\r\nfor it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to\r\nguard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all\r\nsides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence\r\n(if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has\r\nweakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a\r\nsincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only\r\nthe separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then,\r\nshould we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and\r\ndeath is so certain an entrance to happiness\u2014to glory?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there\r\nwas an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she\r\nspoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she\r\nbreathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own\r\nsorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\r\n\n\r\nResting my head on Helen\u2019s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she drew me\r\nto her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus, when another\r\nperson came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had\r\nleft the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone\r\nfull both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as\r\nMiss Temple.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,\u201d said she; \u201cI want you in my room;\r\nand as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe went; following the superintendent\u2019s guidance, we had to thread some\r\nintricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it\r\ncontained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be\r\nseated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking\r\nanother, she called me to her side.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it all over?\u201d she asked, looking down at my face. \u201cHave you cried your\r\ngrief away?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid I never shall do that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma\u2019am, and everybody else, will\r\nnow think me wicked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as\r\na good girl, and you will satisfy us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I, Miss Temple?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will,\u201d said she, passing her arm round me. \u201cAnd now tell me who is the\r\nlady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Reed, my uncle\u2019s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard\r\nthe servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is\r\naccused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been\r\ncharged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever\r\nyour memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate\u2014most\r\ncorrect; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently\r\nwhat I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by\r\nemotion, my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed\r\nthat sad theme; and mindful of Helen\u2019s warnings against the indulgence of\r\nresentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than\r\nordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I\r\nwent on that Miss Temple fully believed me.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me\r\nafter the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the\r\nred-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break\r\nbounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which\r\nclutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and\r\nlocked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.\r\n\n\r\nI had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she then\r\nsaid\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with\r\nyour statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me,\r\nJane, you are clear now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well contented to\r\nstand, for I derived a child\u2019s pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her\r\ndress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining\r\ncurls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot quite so much, I think, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the pain in your chest?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little better.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to\r\nher own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She was pensive a few\r\nminutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.\u201d She rang her\r\nbell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBarbara,\u201d she said to the servant who answered it, \u201cI have not yet had tea;\r\nbring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and\r\nbright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How\r\nfragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which,\r\nhowever, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a\r\nvery small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBarbara,\u201d said she, \u201ccan you not bring a little more bread and butter? There\r\nis not enough for three.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBarbara went out: she returned soon\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst\u2019s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, very well!\u201d returned Miss Temple; \u201cwe must make it do, Barbara, I\r\nsuppose.\u201d And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, \u201cFortunately, I have it\r\nin my power to supply deficiencies for this once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us\r\na cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked\r\na drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to\r\nour eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,\u201d said she, \u201cbut as\r\nthere is so little toast, you must have it now,\u201d and she proceeded to cut\r\nslices with a generous hand.\r\n\n\r\nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of\r\nthe entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess\r\nregarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she\r\nliberally supplied.\r\n\n\r\nTea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat one on\r\neach side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and Helen, which\r\nit was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her mien,\r\nof refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation into the\r\nardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those\r\nwho looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such\r\nwas my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.\r\n\n\r\nThe refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her\r\nbeloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own\r\nunique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first,\r\nthey glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never\r\nseen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes,\r\nwhich had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple\u2019s\u2014a\r\nbeauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of\r\nmeaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language\r\nflowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large\r\nenough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid\r\neloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen\u2019s discourse on that, to me,\r\nmemorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span\r\nas much as many live during a protracted existence.\r\n\n\r\nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of\r\ncountries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke\r\nof books: how many they had read! What stores of knowledge they possessed! Then\r\nthey seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement\r\nreached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a\r\nmoment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a\r\nshelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ\r\nof veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere\r\nthe bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us\r\nboth, saying, as she drew us to her heart\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you, my children!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was\r\nHelen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a\r\nsad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.\r\n\n\r\nOn reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was\r\nexamining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns\u2019s, and when we entered\r\nHelen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should\r\nhave half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy things were indeed in shameful disorder,\u201d murmured Helen to me, in a low\r\nvoice: \u201cI intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNext morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of\r\npasteboard the word \u201cSlattern,\u201d and bound it like a phylactery round Helen\u2019s\r\nlarge, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore it till\r\nevening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The\r\nmoment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it\r\noff, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was incapable had been\r\nburning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been\r\nscalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an\r\nintolerable pain at the heart.\r\n\n\r\nAbout a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had\r\nwritten to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what he said went\r\nto corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school,\r\nannounced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane\r\nEyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely\r\ncleared from every imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed\r\nme, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.\r\n\n\r\nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved\r\nto pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was\r\nproportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with\r\npractice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher\r\nclass; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I\r\nlearned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first\r\ncottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning\r\ntower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to\r\nprepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white\r\nbread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\r\nfeasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark;\r\nall the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque\r\nrocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies\r\nhovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren\u2019s nests\r\nenclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined,\r\ntoo, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a\r\ncertain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was\r\nthat problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.\r\n\n\r\nWell has Solomon said\u2014\u201cBetter is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a\r\nstalled ox and hatred therewith.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and\r\nits daily luxuries.\r\n\n"}
{"11": "\nCHAPTER IX\n\r\nBut the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring drew\r\non: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows\r\nwere melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and\r\nswollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside\r\nunder the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by\r\ntheir Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now\r\nendure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began\r\neven to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds,\r\nwhich, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at\r\nnight, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out\r\namongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed\r\npansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found\r\nstill sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\r\n\n\r\nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only\r\nbounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this\r\npleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow,\r\nrich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling\r\neddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath\r\nthe iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!\u2014when mists as\r\nchill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks,\r\nand rolled down \u201cing\u201d and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the\r\nbeck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder\r\nthe wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild\r\nrain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed\r\nonly ranks of skeletons.\r\n\n\r\nApril advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid\r\nsunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration. And now\r\nvegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all\r\ngreen, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to\r\nmajestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered\r\nvarieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out\r\nof the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in\r\novershadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed\r\noften and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty\r\nand pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.\r\n\n\r\nHave I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as\r\nbosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? Assuredly,\r\npleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.\r\n\n\r\nThat forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred\r\npestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan\r\nAsylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere\r\nMay arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.\r\n\n\r\nSemi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to\r\nreceive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.\r\nClasses were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed\r\nalmost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the\r\nnecessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been\r\notherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple\u2019s whole\r\nattention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never\r\nquitting it except to snatch a few hours\u2019 rest at night. The teachers were\r\nfully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the\r\ndeparture of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and\r\nrelations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many,\r\nalready smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were\r\nburied quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.\r\n\n\r\nWhile disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent\r\nvisitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and\r\npassages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving\r\nvainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded\r\nover the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too,\r\nglowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened,\r\ntulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with\r\npink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and\r\nevening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all\r\nuseless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a\r\nhandful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.\r\n\n\r\nBut I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene\r\nand season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till\r\nnight; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too. Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were\r\nnot scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear\r\nof infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary,\r\nunused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.\r\nBesides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our\r\nbreakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a\r\nregular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold\r\npie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to\r\nthe wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.\r\n\n\r\nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the\r\nvery middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a\r\nfeat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate,\r\ncomfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade\u2014one Mary Ann\r\nWilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly\r\nbecause she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which\r\nset me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and\r\ncould tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found\r\ngratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb\r\nor rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she\r\nliked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much\r\nentertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.\r\n\n\r\nAnd where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet days of\r\nliberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown\r\ntired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was\r\ninferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and\r\nreciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have\r\nspoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of her converse a taste of far higher things.\r\n\n\r\nTrue, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with\r\nmany faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor\r\never ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender,\r\nand respectful as any that ever animated my heart. How could it be otherwise,\r\nwhen Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet\r\nand faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never\r\ntroubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed\r\nfrom my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the\r\nhospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was\r\nconsumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood\r\nsomething mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.\r\n\n\r\nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs\r\non very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden;\r\nbut, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw\r\nher from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much\r\nwrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann\r\nin the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had\r\nwandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely\r\ncottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild\r\nswine that fed on the mast in the wood. When we got back, it was after\r\nmoonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon\u2019s, was standing at the garden\r\ndoor. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr.\r\nBates had been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I\r\nstayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug\r\nup in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the\r\nmorning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet\r\nas the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still\r\nglowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose\r\nwith such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying\r\nthem as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying! This\r\nworld is pleasant\u2014it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go\r\nwho knows where?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been\r\ninfused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled,\r\nbaffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it,\r\nit saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood\u2014the\r\npresent; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at\r\nthe thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this\r\nnew idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a\r\nnurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to\r\nclose the door, but I ran up to her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is Helen Burns?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery poorly,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it her Mr. Bates has been to see?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does he say about her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe says she\u2019ll not be here long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the\r\nnotion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I\r\nshould not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly\r\nnow! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her\r\nlast days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of\r\nspirits, if such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a\r\nstrong thrill of grief, then a desire\u2014a necessity to see her; and I asked in\r\nwhat room she lay.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is in Miss Temple\u2019s room,\u201d said the nurse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay I go up and speak to her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you\u2019ll\r\ncatch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to\r\nthe schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o\u2019clock, and Miss Miller was\r\ncalling the pupils to go to bed.\r\n\n\r\nIt might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I\u2014not having been able\r\nto fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my\r\ncompanions were all wrapt in profound repose\u2014rose softly, put on my frock over\r\nmy night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in\r\nquest of Miss Temple\u2019s room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I\r\nknew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and\r\nthere at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of\r\ncamphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I\r\npassed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should\r\nhear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see\r\nHelen,\u2014I must embrace her before she died,\u2014I must give her one last kiss,\r\nexchange with her one last word.\r\n\n\r\nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and\r\nsucceeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another\r\nflight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss\r\nTemple\u2019s room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a\r\nprofound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door\r\nslightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of\r\nsickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses\u2014soul and\r\nsenses quivering with keen throes\u2014I put it back and looked in. My eye sought\r\nHelen, and feared to find death.\r\n\n\r\nClose by Miss Temple\u2019s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there\r\nstood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the\r\nface was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an\r\neasy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple\r\nwas not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious\r\npatient in the fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand\r\nwas on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still\r\nrecoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHelen!\u201d I whispered softly, \u201care you awake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted,\r\nbut quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly\r\ndissipated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan it be you, Jane?\u201d she asked, in her own gentle voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I thought, \u201cshe is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could not\r\nspeak and look so calmly if she were.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both\r\ncold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o\u2019clock: I heard it strike some\r\nminutes since.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep\r\ntill I had spoken to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; to my long home\u2014my last home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, Helen!\u201d I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit\r\nof coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was\r\nover, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long\r\nsilence, she resumed, still whispering\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and\r\nnot grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the\r\nillness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind\r\nis at rest. I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is\r\nlately married, and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great\r\nsufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the\r\nworld: I should have been continually at fault.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe; I have faith: I am going to God.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is God? What is God?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely implicitly\r\non His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that\r\neventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our\r\nsouls can get to it when we die?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my\r\nimmortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is my friend:\r\nI love Him; I believe He loves me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty,\r\nuniversal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought. \u201cWhere is that region? Does\r\nit exist?\u201d And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me\r\nthan ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on\r\nher neck. Presently she said, in the sweetest tone\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel\r\nas if I could sleep: but don\u2019t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you warm, darling?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Helen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in\r\nsomebody\u2019s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage\r\nback to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had\r\nsomething else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many\r\nquestions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning\r\nto her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against\r\nHelen Burns\u2019s shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen\r\nwas\u2014dead.\r\n\n\r\nHer grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it\r\nwas only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the\r\nspot, inscribed with her name, and the word \u201cResurgam.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"12": "\nCHAPTER X\n\r\nHitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence: to\r\nthe first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters. But this\r\nis not to be a regular autobiography: I am only bound to invoke Memory where I\r\nknow her responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a\r\nspace of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep\r\nup the links of connection.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it\r\ngradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of\r\nits victims had drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made into the\r\norigin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited\r\npublic indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the\r\nquantity and quality of the children\u2019s food; the brackish, fetid water used in\r\nits preparation; the pupils\u2019 wretched clothing and accommodations\u2014all these\r\nthings were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for\r\nthe erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new\r\nregulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds\r\nof the school were intrusted to the management of a committee. Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be\r\noverlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the\r\ndischarge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising\r\nminds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to\r\ncombine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with\r\nuprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble\r\ninstitution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for\r\neight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my\r\ntestimony to its value and importance.\r\n\n\r\nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was\r\nnot inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach;\r\na fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with\r\na great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me\r\non: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be\r\nthe first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of\r\nteacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that\r\ntime I altered.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the\r\nseminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her\r\nfriendship and society had been my continual solace; she had stood me in the\r\nstead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she\r\nmarried, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy\r\nof such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.\r\n\n\r\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled\r\nfeeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I\r\nhad imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more\r\nharmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the\r\ninmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I\r\nbelieved I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I\r\nappeared a disciplined and subdued character.\r\n\n\r\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss\r\nTemple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly\r\nafter the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear\r\nbeyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude\r\nthe greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.\r\n\n\r\nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be\r\nregretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were\r\nconcluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening\r\nfar advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I\r\nhad undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had\r\nborrowed of Miss Temple\u2014or rather that she had taken with her the serene\r\natmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity\u2014and that now I was left in my\r\nnatural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not\r\nseem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was\r\nnot the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for\r\ntranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my\r\nexperience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real\r\nworld was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and\r\nexcitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to\r\nseek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\r\n\n\r\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the\r\nbuilding; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the\r\nhilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote,\r\nthe blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of\r\nrock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road\r\nwinding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two;\r\nhow I longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled\r\nthat very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an\r\nage seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and\r\nI had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs.\r\nReed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had\r\never been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the\r\nouter world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and\r\nvoices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and\r\nantipathies\u2014such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not\r\nenough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired\r\nliberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed\r\nscattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler\r\nsupplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into\r\nvague space: \u201cThen,\u201d I cried, half desperate, \u201cgrant me at least a new\r\nservitude!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\r\n\n\r\nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime:\r\neven then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject\r\nto which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How I wished\r\nsleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which\r\nhad last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion\r\nwould rise for my relief.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her\r\nhabitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as\r\na nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was\r\ndebarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA new servitude! There is something in that,\u201d I soliloquised (mentally, be it\r\nunderstood; I did not talk aloud). \u201cI know there is, because it does not sound\r\ntoo sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment:\r\ndelightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and\r\nfleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That\r\nmust be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now\r\nall I want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not\r\nthe thing feasible? Yes\u2014yes\u2014the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain\r\nactive enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I\r\ncovered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again\r\nwith all my might.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new\r\ncircumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How\r\ndo people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no\r\nfriends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for\r\nthemselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a\r\nresponse, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in\r\nmy head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result\r\ncame of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the\r\nroom; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again\r\ncrept to bed.\r\n\n\r\nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my\r\npillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind:\u2014\u201cThose who\r\nwant situations advertise; you must advertise in the \u2014\u2014shire Herald.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow? I know nothing about advertising.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover\r\ndirected to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first\r\nopportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to\r\nJ.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after\r\nyou send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had\r\nit in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.\r\n\n\r\nWith earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed, and\r\ndirected before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA young lady accustomed to tuition\u201d (had I not been a teacher two years?) \u201cis\r\ndesirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are\r\nunder fourteen\u201d (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to\r\nundertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age). \u201cShe is qualified to teach\r\nthe usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing,\r\nand Music\u201d (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of\r\naccomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). \u201cAddress, J.E.,\r\nPost-office, Lowton, \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of\r\nthe new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small\r\ncommissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was\r\nreadily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet,\r\nbut the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into\r\nthe post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but\r\nwith a relieved heart.\r\n\n\r\nThe succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all\r\nsublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I\r\nfound myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the\r\nway; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the\r\ndale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be\r\nawaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea\r\nand water.\r\n\n\r\nMy ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes;\r\nso I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the\r\nclean and quiet little street from the shoemaker\u2019s to the post-office: it was\r\nkept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on\r\nher hands.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre there any letters for J.E.?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\nShe peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled\r\namong its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter. At\r\nlast, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she\r\npresented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive\r\nand mistrustful glance\u2014it was for J.E.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there only one?\u201d I demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere are no more,\u201d said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face\r\nhomeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and\r\nit was already half-past seven.\r\n\n\r\nVarious duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the girls during\r\ntheir hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed:\r\nafterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we finally retired for\r\nthe night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a\r\nshort end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till\r\nit was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten\r\nproduced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished\r\nundressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter;\r\nthe seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf J.E., who advertised in the \u2014\u2014shire Herald of last Thursday,\r\npossesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give\r\nsatisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be\r\noffered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of\r\nage; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E. is requested to send\r\nreferences, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather\r\nuncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a\r\nprivate fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own\r\nguidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I\r\nwished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en r\u00e8gle.\r\nI now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on\r\nhand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow\u2019s cap; frigid, perhaps,\r\nbut not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that,\r\ndoubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I\r\nfailed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote,\r\n\u2014\u2014shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it;\r\nboth the shire and the town. \u2014\u2014shire was seventy miles nearer London than the\r\nremote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to\r\ngo where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town\r\non the banks of the A\u2014\u2014: a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it\r\nwould be a complete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by\r\nthe idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke\u2014\u201cbut,\u201d I argued, \u201cThornfield\r\nwill, probably, be a good way from the town.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\r\n\n\r\nNext day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my\r\nown breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success. Having sought\r\nand obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation,\r\nI told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would\r\nbe double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got \u00a315 per annum);\r\nand requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of\r\nthe committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as\r\nreferences. She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The\r\nnext day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed\r\nmust be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was accordingly\r\naddressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that \u201cI might do as I pleased:\r\nshe had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.\u201d This note went the\r\nround of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious\r\ndelay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an\r\nassurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher\r\nand pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the\r\ninspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.\r\n\n\r\nThis testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of\r\nit to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady\u2019s reply, stating that she was satisfied,\r\nand fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of\r\ngoverness in her house.\r\n\n\r\nI now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a\r\nvery large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day\r\nsufficed to pack my trunk,\u2014the same I had brought with me eight years ago from\r\nGateshead.\r\n\n\r\nThe box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was to call\r\nfor it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour\r\nthe next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my black stuff\r\ntravelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my\r\ndrawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to\r\ndo, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all\r\nday, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my\r\nlife was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber\r\nin the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being\r\naccomplished.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss,\u201d said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a\r\ntroubled spirit, \u201ca person below wishes to see you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe carrier, no doubt,\u201d I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. I was\r\npassing the back-parlour or teachers\u2019 sitting-room, the door of which was half\r\nopen, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s her, I am sure!\u2014I could have told her anywhere!\u201d cried the individual who\r\nstopped my progress and took my hand.\r\n\n\r\nI looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, yet\r\nstill young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, who is it?\u201d she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised;\r\n\u201cyou\u2019ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: \u201cBessie! Bessie!\r\nBessie!\u201d that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both\r\nwent into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in\r\nplaid frock and trousers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is my little boy,\u201d said Bessie directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are married, Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I\u2019ve a little\r\ngirl besides Bobby there, that I\u2019ve christened Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t live at Gateshead?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI live at the lodge: the old porter has left.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but\r\nsit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?\u201d but Bobby\r\npreferred sidling over to his mother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,\u201d continued Mrs.\r\nLeaven. \u201cI dare say they\u2019ve not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the\r\nhead and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of\r\nyou in breadth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGeorgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody\r\nadmired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were\r\nagainst the match; and\u2014what do you think?\u2014he and Miss Georgiana made it up to\r\nrun away; but they were found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them\r\nout: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog\r\nlife together; they are always quarrelling\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what of John Reed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to college, and he\r\ngot\u2014plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a\r\nbarrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will\r\nnever make much of him, I think.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has\r\nsuch thick lips.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Reed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMissis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she\u2019s not quite\r\neasy in her mind: Mr. John\u2019s conduct does not please her\u2014he spends a deal of\r\nmoney.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid she send you here, Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had\r\nbeen a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country,\r\nI thought I\u2019d just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of\r\nmy reach.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.\u201d I said this laughing: I\r\nperceived that Bessie\u2019s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape\r\ndenote admiration.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and\r\nit is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled at Bessie\u2019s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I\r\nwas not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to\r\nplease, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that\r\ndesire brings anything but gratification.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI dare say you are clever, though,\u201d continued Bessie, by way of solace. \u201cWhat\r\ncan you do? Can you play on the piano?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit\r\ndown and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Miss Reeds could not play as well!\u201d said she exultingly. \u201cI always said\r\nyou would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.\u201d It was a landscape in\r\nwater colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in\r\nacknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and\r\nwhich she had framed and glazed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed\u2019s\r\ndrawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could\r\nnot come near it: and have you learnt French?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can work on muslin and canvas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on\r\nwhether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask\r\nyou. Have you ever heard anything from your father\u2019s kinsfolk, the Eyres?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever in my life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and\r\nthey may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for\r\none day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see\r\nyou; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much\r\ndisappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign\r\ncountry, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite\r\na gentleman, and I believe he was your father\u2019s brother.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat foreign country was he going to, Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn island thousands of miles off, where they make wine\u2014the butler did tell\r\nme\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadeira?\u201d I suggested.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is it\u2014that is the very word.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo he went?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him;\r\nshe called him afterwards a \u2018sneaking tradesman.\u2019 My Robert believes he was a\r\nwine-merchant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery likely,\u201d I returned; \u201cor perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was obliged\r\nto leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton,\r\nwhile I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the door of the\r\nBrocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow\r\nof Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead,\r\nI mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the\r\nunknown environs of Millcote.\r\n\n"}
{"13": "\nCHAPTER XI\n\r\nA new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I\r\ndraw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the\r\nGeorge Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn\r\nrooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece,\r\nsuch prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the\r\nPrince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is\r\nvisible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by\r\nthat of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and\r\numbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill\r\ncontracted by sixteen hours\u2019 exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left\r\nLowton at four o\u2019clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now\r\njust striking eight.\r\n\n\r\nReader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my\r\nmind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me;\r\nI looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the \u201cboots\u201d placed for\r\nmy convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some\r\ndescription of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort\r\nwas visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a\r\nMiss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request\r\nto be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of\r\ndoubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.\r\n\n\r\nIt is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite\r\nalone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the\r\nport to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments\r\nfrom returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that\r\nsensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it;\r\nand fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was\r\nalone. I bethought myself to ring the bell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?\u201d I asked of the\r\nwaiter who answered the summons.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThornfield? I don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am; I\u2019ll inquire at the bar.\u201d He vanished, but\r\nreappeared instantly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs your name Eyre, Miss?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerson here waiting for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a\r\nman was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a\r\none-horse conveyance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis will be your luggage, I suppose?\u201d said the man rather abruptly when he\r\nsaw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got\r\nin; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA matter of six miles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long shall we be before we get there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHappen an hour and a half.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set off. Our\r\nprogress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be\r\nat length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the\r\ncomfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d thought I, \u201cjudging from the plainness of the servant and\r\ncarriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I\r\nnever lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them. I\r\nwonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any\r\ndegree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best;\r\nit is a pity that doing one\u2019s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I\r\ntook that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I\r\nremember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not\r\nturn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her!\r\nlet the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again. How far are we on our\r\nroad now, I wonder?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the\r\nnumber of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger\r\nthan Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there\r\nwere houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different\r\nregion to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less\r\nromantic.\r\n\n\r\nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the\r\nway, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last\r\nhe turned in his seat and said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re noan so far fro\u2019 Thornfield now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against\r\nthe sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights\r\ntoo, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the\r\ndriver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed\r\nto behind us. We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a\r\nhouse: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were\r\ndark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I\r\nalighted and went in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you walk this way, ma\u2019am?\u201d said the girl; and I followed her across a\r\nsquare hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double\r\nillumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with\r\nthe darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see,\r\nhowever, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.\r\n\n\r\nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed\r\nand old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in\r\nwidow\u2019s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had\r\nfancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking. She was occupied in\r\nknitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to\r\ncomplete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for\r\na new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to\r\noverwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady\r\ngot up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives\r\nso slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax, I suppose?\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, you are right: do sit down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie\r\nmy bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.\r\nLeah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of\r\nthe storeroom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\r\ndelivered them to the servant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, draw nearer to the fire,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought your\r\nluggage with you, haven\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see it carried into your room,\u201d she said, and bustled out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe treats me like a visitor,\u201d thought I. \u201cI little expected such a reception;\r\nI anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard\r\nof the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or\r\ntwo from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then\r\nherself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather confused at being the object\r\nof more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my\r\nemployer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was\r\ndoing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities\r\nquietly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?\u201d I asked, when I\r\nhad partaken of what she offered me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,\u201d returned the good lady,\r\napproaching her ear to my mouth.\r\n\n\r\nI repeated the question more distinctly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your future\r\npupil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Then she is not your daughter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u2014I have no family.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens\r\nwas connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many\r\nquestions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so glad,\u201d she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took the cat\r\non her knee; \u201cI am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here\r\nnow with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is\r\na fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a\r\nrespectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in\r\nthe best quarters. I say alone\u2014Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his\r\nwife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one\r\ncan\u2019t converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\r\ndistance, for fear of losing one\u2019s authority. I\u2019m sure last winter (it was a\r\nvery severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and\r\nblew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from\r\nNovember till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night\r\nafter night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don\u2019t think the\r\npoor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one\r\ngot on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at\r\nthe commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a\r\nchild makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite\r\ngay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my\r\nchair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find\r\nmy company as agreeable as she anticipated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,\u201d said she; \u201cit is on the\r\nstroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel\r\ntired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I\u2019ll show you your bedroom. I\u2019ve\r\nhad the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I\r\nthought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be\r\nsure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never\r\nsleep in them myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my\r\nlong journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her candle, and I\r\nfollowed her from the room. First she went to see if the hall-door was\r\nfastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The\r\nsteps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed;\r\nboth it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if\r\nthey belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air\r\npervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and\r\nsolitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of\r\nsmall dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door,\r\ngazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by\r\nthat wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery,\r\nby the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of\r\nbodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse\r\nof gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up\r\nthanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my\r\nfurther path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly\r\noffered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my\r\nsolitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly:\r\nwhen I awoke it was broad day.\r\n\n\r\nThe chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between\r\nthe gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted\r\nfloor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits\r\nrose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a\r\nfairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and\r\npleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change\r\nof scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely\r\ndefine what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day\r\nor that month, but at an indefinite future period.\r\n\n\r\nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain\u2014for I had no article of\r\nattire that was not made with extreme simplicity\u2014I was still by nature\r\nsolicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or\r\ncareless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as\r\nwell as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I\r\nsometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy\r\ncheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately,\r\nand finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so\r\npale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these\r\naspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then\r\ndistinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason\r\ntoo. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black\r\nfrock\u2014which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a\r\nnicety\u2014and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably\r\nenough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least\r\nrecoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I\r\nleft all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\r\n\n\r\nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak;\r\nthen I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on\r\nthe walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady\r\nwith powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the\r\nceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon\r\nblack with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to\r\nme; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was\r\nhalf of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn\r\nmorning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green\r\nfields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the\r\nmansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\r\nconsiderable: a gentleman\u2019s manor-house, not a nobleman\u2019s seat: battlements\r\nround the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out well from\r\nthe background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they\r\nflew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these\r\nwere separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees,\r\nstrong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the\r\nmansion\u2019s designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round\r\nLowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living\r\nworld; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield\r\nwith a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring\r\nlocality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees,\r\nstraggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood\r\nnearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and\r\ngates.\r\n\n\r\nI was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with\r\ndelight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the\r\nhall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like\r\nMrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! out already?\u201d said she. \u201cI see you are an early riser.\u201d I went up to\r\nher, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you like Thornfield?\u201d she asked. I told her I liked it very much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cit is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of\r\norder, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside\r\nhere permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine\r\ngrounds require the presence of the proprietor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWho is he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe owner of Thornfield,\u201d she responded quietly. \u201cDid you not know he was\r\ncalled Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course I did not\u2014I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to\r\nregard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody\r\nmust be acquainted by instinct.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought,\u201d I continued, \u201cThornfield belonged to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the housekeeper\u2014the\r\nmanager. To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother\u2019s\r\nside, or at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay\u2014that\r\nlittle village yonder on the hill\u2014and that church near the gates was his. The\r\npresent Mr. Rochester\u2019s mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband:\r\nbut I never presume on the connection\u2014in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider\r\nmyself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always\r\ncivil, and I expect nothing more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the little girl\u2014my pupil!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is Mr. Rochester\u2019s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her.\r\nHe intended to have her brought up in \u2014\u2014shire, I believe. Here she comes, with\r\nher \u2018bonne,\u2019 as she calls her nurse.\u201d The enigma then was explained: this\r\naffable and kind little widow was no great dame; but a dependent like myself. I\r\ndid not like her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased\r\nthan ever. The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of\r\ncondescension on her part: so much the better\u2014my position was all the freer.\r\n\n\r\nAs I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\r\nattendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not at first\r\nappear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old,\r\nslightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair\r\nfalling in curls to her waist.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Adela,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cCome and speak to the lady who\r\nis to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.\u201d She approached.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est l\u00e0 ma gouvernante!\u201d said she, pointing to me, and addressing her nurse;\r\nwho answered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais oui, certainement.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre they foreigners?\u201d I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe,\r\nnever left it till within six months ago. When she first came here she could\r\nspeak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don\u2019t\r\nunderstand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning\r\nvery well, I dare say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady;\r\nand as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as\r\nI could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of\r\nFrench by heart daily\u2014applying myself to take pains with my accent, and\r\nimitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had\r\nacquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was\r\nnot likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook\r\nhands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to\r\nbreakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied\r\nbriefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined\r\nme some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced\r\nchattering fluently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried she, in French, \u201cyou speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester\r\ndoes: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad:\r\nnobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse;\r\nshe came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked\u2014how it\r\ndid smoke!\u2014and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr.\r\nRochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and\r\nI had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a\r\nshelf. And Mademoiselle\u2014what is your name?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEyre\u2014Jane Eyre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it\r\nwas quite daylight, at a great city\u2014a huge city, with very dark houses and all\r\nsmoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester\r\ncarried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we\r\nall got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than\r\nthis and finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie\r\nused to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park;\r\nand there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds\r\nin it, that I fed with crumbs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan you understand her when she runs on so fast?\u201d asked Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n\n\r\nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of\r\nMadame Pierrot.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish,\u201d continued the good lady, \u201cyou would ask her a question or two about\r\nher parents: I wonder if she remembers them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAd\u00e8le,\u201d I inquired, \u201cwith whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean\r\ntown you spoke of?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama used to\r\nteach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and\r\nladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their\r\nknees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her\r\naccomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my\r\nknee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her\r\ncurls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from\r\nsome opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the\r\nperfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her\r\nin her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one\r\nthat night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how\r\nlittle his desertion has affected her.\r\n\n\r\nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the\r\npoint of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled\r\nwith the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I\r\nthought so.\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of\r\nher age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, \u201cNow, Mademoiselle, I\r\nwill repeat you some poetry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAssuming an attitude, she began, \u201cLa Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.\u201d She\r\nthen declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis,\r\na flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed\r\nat her age, and which proved she had been carefully trained.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it your mama who taught you that piece?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she just used to say it in this way: \u2018Qu\u2019avez vous donc? lui dit un\r\nde ces rats; parlez!\u2019 She made me lift my hand\u2014so\u2014to remind me to raise my\r\nvoice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say,\r\nwith whom did you live then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith Madame Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing\r\nrelated to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama. I\r\nwas not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with\r\nhim in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame\r\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but\r\nyou see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he\r\nis gone back again himself, and I never see him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Ad\u00e8le and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears,\r\nMr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books\r\nwere locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open\r\ncontaining everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and\r\nseveral volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few\r\nromances, &c. I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess\r\nwould require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for\r\nthe present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to\r\nglean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and\r\ninformation. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of\r\nsuperior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.\r\n\n\r\nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not\r\nbeen used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be injudicious to\r\nconfine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and\r\ngot her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed\r\nher to return to her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time\r\nin drawing some little sketches for her use.\r\n\n\r\nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called\r\nto me: \u201cYour morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,\u201d said she. She was\r\nin a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed\r\nme. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a\r\nTurkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass,\r\nand a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine\r\npurple spar, which stood on a sideboard.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat a beautiful room!\u201d I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before\r\nseen any half so imposing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in a\r\nlittle air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are\r\nseldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a\r\nTyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two broad steps, and\r\nlooking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my\r\nnovice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty\r\ndrawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which\r\nseemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of\r\nwhite grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson\r\ncouches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were\r\nof sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors\r\nrepeated the general blending of snow and fire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d said I. \u201cNo dust, no canvas\r\ncoverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were\r\ninhabited daily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester\u2019s visits here are rare, they are always\r\nsudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything\r\nswathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it\r\nbest to keep the rooms in readiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot particularly so; but he has a gentleman\u2019s tastes and habits, and he\r\nexpects to have things managed in conformity to them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like him? Is he generally liked?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in\r\nthis neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time\r\nout of mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked\r\nfor himself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\r\nconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived\r\nmuch amongst them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps:\r\nhe has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should\r\nthink. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn what way is he peculiar?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014it is not easy to describe\u2014nothing striking, but you feel it when\r\nhe speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest,\r\nwhether he is pleased or the contrary; you don\u2019t thoroughly understand him, in\r\nshort\u2014at least, I don\u2019t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good\r\nmaster.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine.\r\nThere are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or\r\nobserving and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good\r\nlady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her\r\nout. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed\r\nproprietor\u2014nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently\r\nwondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.\r\n\n\r\nWhen we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the\r\nhouse; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all\r\nwas well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially\r\ngrand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were\r\ninteresting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the\r\nlower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed:\r\nand the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a\r\nhundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange\r\ncarvings of palm branches and cherubs\u2019 heads, like types of the Hebrew ark;\r\nrows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,\r\non whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries,\r\nwrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these\r\nrelics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the\r\npast: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these\r\nretreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night\u2019s repose on one of those\r\nwide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others,\r\nwith wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies\r\nof strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,\u2014all which\r\nwould have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo the servants sleep in these rooms?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps\r\nhere: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this\r\nwould be its haunt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo I think: you have no ghost, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone that I ever heard of,\u201d returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent\r\nthan a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest\r\ntranquilly in their graves now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014\u2018after life\u2019s fitful fever they sleep well,\u2019\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhere are you\r\ngoing now, Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d for she was moving away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?\u201d I followed\r\nstill, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and\r\nthrough a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow\r\ncolony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements and\r\nlooking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and\r\nvelvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a\r\npark, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path\r\nvisibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the\r\nchurch at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn\r\nday\u2019s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly\r\nwhite. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I\r\nturned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the\r\nladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air\r\nto which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and\r\ngreen hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing\r\nwith delight.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint of\r\ngroping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow\r\ngarret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating\r\nthe front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only\r\none little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black\r\ndoors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard\u2019s castle.\r\n\n\r\nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a\r\nregion, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal,\r\nmirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again,\r\nlouder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off in a\r\nclamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it\r\noriginated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents\r\nissued.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax!\u201d I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs.\r\n\u201cDid you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome of the servants, very likely,\u201d she answered: \u201cperhaps Grace Poole.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you hear it?\u201d I again inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah\r\nis with her; they are frequently noisy together.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd\r\nmurmur.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGrace!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n\n\r\nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as\r\npreternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and\r\nthat no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but\r\nthat neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously\r\nafraid. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even\r\nof surprise.\r\n\n\r\nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,\u2014a woman of between thirty\r\nand forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face:\r\nany apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cToo much noise, Grace,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cRemember directions!\u201d Grace\r\ncurtseyed silently and went in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid\u2019s work,\u201d\r\ncontinued the widow; \u201cnot altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she\r\ndoes well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this\r\nmorning?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe conversation, thus turned on Ad\u00e8le, continued till we reached the light and\r\ncheerful region below. Ad\u00e8le came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMesdames, vous \u00eates servies!\u201d adding, \u201cJ\u2019ai bien faim, moi!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room.\r\n\n"}
{"14": "\nCHAPTER XII\n\r\nThe promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield\r\nHall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place\r\nand its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a\r\nplacid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average\r\nintelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged,\r\nand therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my\r\ncare, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans\r\nfor her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and\r\nteachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar\r\ndevelopment of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary\r\nlevel of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her\r\nbelow it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though\r\nperhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and\r\nefforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment\r\nsufficient to make us both content in each other\u2019s society.\r\n\n\r\nThis, par parenth\u00e8se, will be thought cool language by persons who\r\nentertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty\r\nof those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous\r\ndevotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or\r\nprop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a conscientious\r\nsolicitude for Ad\u00e8le\u2019s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little\r\nself: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness,\r\nand a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for\r\nme, and the moderation of her mind and character.\r\n\n\r\nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I\r\ntook a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked\r\nthrough them along the road; or when, while Ad\u00e8le played with her nurse, and\r\nMrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases,\r\nraised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out\r\nafar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line\u2014that then I longed\r\nfor a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the\r\nbusy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen\u2014that then\r\nI desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse\r\nwith my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within\r\nmy reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Ad\u00e8le;\r\nbut I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and\r\nwhat I believed in I wished to behold.\r\n\n\r\nWho blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not\r\nhelp it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.\r\nThen my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey,\r\nbackwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow\r\nmy mind\u2019s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it\u2014and,\r\ncertainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the\r\nexultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with\r\nlife; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended\u2014a\r\ntale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of\r\nincident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual\r\nexistence.\r\n\n\r\nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they\r\nmust have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are\r\ncondemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt\r\nagainst their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political\r\nrebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed\r\nto be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise\r\nfor their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers\r\ndo; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation,\r\nprecisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged\r\nfellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making\r\npuddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.\r\nIt is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or\r\nlearn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\r\n\n\r\nWhen thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole\u2019s laugh: the same peal,\r\nthe same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard,\r\ntoo, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There were days when she\r\nwas quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds\r\nshe made. Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or\r\na plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return,\r\ngenerally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!)\r\nbearing a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the\r\ncuriosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no\r\npoint to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into\r\nconversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply\r\nusually cut short every effort of that sort.\r\n\n\r\nThe other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the\r\nhousemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect\r\nremarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her\r\nquestions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or\r\nnarrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were\r\ncalculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.\r\n\n\r\nOctober, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax\r\nhad begged a holiday for Ad\u00e8le, because she had a cold; and, as Ad\u00e8le seconded\r\nthe request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays\r\nhad been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in\r\nshowing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I\r\nwas tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs.\r\nFairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on\r\nmy bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two\r\nmiles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Ad\u00e8le comfortably\r\nseated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour fireside, and given her\r\nher best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer)\r\nto play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to\r\nher \u201cRevenez bient\u00f4t, ma bonne amie, ma ch\u00e8re Mdlle. Jeannette,\u201d with a kiss, I\r\nset out.\r\n\n\r\nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till\r\nI got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of\r\npleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was three o\u2019clock; the\r\nchurch bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in\r\nits approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile\r\nfrom Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and\r\nblackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips\r\nand haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless\r\nrepose. If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a\r\nholly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes\r\nwere as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the\r\npath. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now\r\nbrowsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge,\r\nlooked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.\r\n\n\r\nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat\r\ndown on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering my mantle about me,\r\nand sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze\r\nkeenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little\r\nbrooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.\r\nFrom my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall\r\nwas the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\r\nagainst the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank\r\ncrimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.\r\n\n\r\nOn the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but\r\nbrightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent\r\nup a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the\r\nabsolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt\r\nthe flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were\r\nmany hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That\r\nevening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the\r\nmost remote.\r\n\n\r\nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away\r\nand so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the\r\nsoft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough\r\nboles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the\r\na\u00ebrial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where\r\ntint melts into tint.\r\n\n\r\nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet\r\nhid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was\r\nnarrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I was young, and all sorts\r\nof fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories\r\nwere there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added\r\nto them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse\r\napproached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered\r\ncertain of Bessie\u2019s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a\r\n\u201cGytrash,\u201d which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary\r\nways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming\r\nupon me.\r\n\n\r\nIt was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp,\r\nI heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a\r\ngreat dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the\r\ntrees. It was exactly one form of Bessie\u2019s Gytrash\u2014a lion-like creature with\r\nlong hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying\r\nto look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it\r\nwould. The horse followed,\u2014a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the\r\nhuman being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was\r\nalways alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb\r\ncarcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.\r\nNo Gytrash was this,\u2014only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He\r\npassed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an\r\nexclamation of \u201cWhat the deuce is to do now?\u201d and a clattering tumble, arrested\r\nmy attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice\r\nwhich glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in\r\na predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills\r\nechoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed\r\nround the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could\r\ndo,\u2014there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to\r\nthe traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts\r\nwere so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the\r\nquestion\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you injured, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some\r\nformula which prevented him from replying to me directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d I asked again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must just stand on one side,\u201d he answered as he rose, first to his knees,\r\nand then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering\r\nprocess, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some\r\nyards\u2019 distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event.\r\nThis was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was\r\nsilenced with a \u201cDown, Pilot!\u201d The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and\r\nleg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for\r\nhe halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\r\n\n\r\nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now\r\ndrew near him again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from\r\nThornfield Hall or from Hay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,\u2014only a sprain;\u201d and again he\r\nstood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary \u201cUgh!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could\r\nsee him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and\r\nsteel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points\r\nof middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with\r\nstern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful\r\nand thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age;\r\nperhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.\r\nHad he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared\r\nto stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services\r\nunasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to\r\none. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,\r\nfascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I\r\nshould have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy\r\nwith anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning,\r\nor anything else that is bright but antipathetic.\r\n\n\r\nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed\r\nhim; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should\r\nhave gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the\r\nfrown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station\r\nwhen he waved to me to go, and announced\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane,\r\ntill I see you are fit to mount your horse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction\r\nbefore.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should think you ought to be at home yourself,\u201d said he, \u201cif you have a home\r\nin this neighbourhood: where do you come from?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFrom just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is\r\nmoonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:\r\nindeed, I am going there to post a letter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou live just below\u2014do you mean at that house with the battlements?\u201d pointing\r\nto Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out\r\ndistinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now\r\nseemed one mass of shadow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, I have never seen him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is not resident, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me where he is?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are\u2014\u201d He stopped, ran his\r\neye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a\r\nblack beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady\u2019s-maid. He\r\nseemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am the governess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, the governess!\u201d he repeated; \u201cdeuce take me, if I had not forgotten! The\r\ngoverness!\u201d and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In two minutes he rose\r\nfrom the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot commission you to fetch help,\u201d he said; \u201cbut you may help me a little\r\nyourself, if you will be so kind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTry to get hold of my horse\u2019s bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it,\r\nI was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the\r\ntall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and\r\nwould not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain:\r\nmeantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet. The traveller\r\nwaited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, \u201cthe mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you\r\ncan do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI came. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he continued: \u201cnecessity compels me to make you useful.\u201d\r\nHe laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some stress, limped\r\nto his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang\r\nto his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his\r\nsprain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, \u201cjust hand me my\r\nwhip; it lies there under the hedge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sought it and found it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you\r\ncan.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then bound\r\naway; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLike heath that, in the wilderness,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wild wind whirls away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone for me:\r\nit was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet\r\nit marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been\r\nneeded and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something;\r\ntrivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was\r\nweary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture\r\nintroduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others\r\nhanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was\r\ndark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and\r\nslipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill\r\nall the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round\r\nand listened, with an idea that a horse\u2019s hoofs might ring on the causeway\r\nagain, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might\r\nbe again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising\r\nup still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of\r\nwind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when\r\nI glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the\r\nhall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was\r\nlate, and I hurried on.\r\n\n\r\nI did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to\r\nstagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek\r\nmy own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend\r\nthe long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint\r\nexcitement wakened by my walk,\u2014to slip again over my faculties the viewless\r\nfetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very\r\nprivileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What\r\ngood it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an\r\nuncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter\r\nexperience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much\r\ngood as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a \u201ctoo easy chair\u201d to take\r\na long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,\r\nas it would be under his.\r\n\n\r\nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards\r\non the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see\r\ninto the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy\r\nhouse\u2014from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me\u2014to\r\nthat sky expanded before me,\u2014a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon\r\nascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the\r\nhill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and\r\naspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless\r\ndistance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my\r\nheart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to\r\nearth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and\r\nstars, opened a side-door, and went in.\r\n\n\r\nThe hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a\r\nwarm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase. This ruddy\r\nshine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and\r\nshowed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass\r\nfire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most\r\npleasant radiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had\r\nscarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices,\r\namongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Ad\u00e8le, when the door closed.\r\n\n\r\nI hastened to Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle,\r\nand no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing\r\nwith gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog,\r\njust like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went forward and\r\nsaid\u2014\u201cPilot,\u201d and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed\r\nhim, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone\r\nwith, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a\r\ncandle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat dog is this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe came with master.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith whom?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith master\u2014Mr. Rochester\u2014he is just arrived.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, and Miss Ad\u00e8le; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a\r\nsurgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is\r\nsprained.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid the horse fall in Hay Lane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! Bring me a candle will you Leah?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nLeah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news;\r\nadding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester:\r\nthen she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off\r\nmy things.\r\n\n"}
{"15": "\nCHAPTER XIII\n\r\nMr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon\u2019s orders, went to bed early that night;\r\nnor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down, it was to attend to\r\nbusiness: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak\r\nwith him.\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as\r\na reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and\r\nthere I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I\r\ndiscerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed\r\nplace: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at\r\nthe door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new\r\nvoices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing\r\nthrough it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to\r\nthe door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of\r\nMr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I\r\nshrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted;\r\nthen, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk\r\nincessantly of her \u201cami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,\u201d as she\r\ndubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what\r\npresents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before,\r\nthat when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a\r\nlittle box in whose contents she had an interest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt cela doit signifier,\u201d said she, \u201cqu\u2019il y aura l\u00e0 dedans un cadeau pour moi,\r\net peut-\u00eatre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parl\u00e9 de vous: il m\u2019a\r\ndemand\u00e9 le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une petite personne,\r\nassez mince et un peu p\u00e2le. J\u2019ai dit qu\u2019oui: car c\u2019est vrai, n\u2019est-ce pas,\r\nmademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour; the afternoon was wild\r\nand snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Ad\u00e8le to put\r\naway books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence\r\nbelow, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that\r\nMr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but\r\nnothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the\r\nair, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back\r\nto the fireside.\r\n\n\r\nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to\r\nhave seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in,\r\nbreaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and\r\nscattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on\r\nmy solitude.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in\r\nthe drawing-room this evening,\u201d said she: \u201che has been so much engaged all day\r\nthat he could not ask to see you before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen is his tea-time?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, at six o\u2019clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had better change\r\nyour frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it necessary to change my frock?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my\r\nroom, and, with Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of\r\nblack silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light\r\ngrey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be\r\nworn, except on first-rate occasions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou want a brooch,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament\r\nwhich Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went\r\ndownstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus\r\nformally summoned in Mr. Rochester\u2019s presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me\r\ninto the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and,\r\npassing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess\r\nbeyond.\r\n\n\r\nTwo wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking\r\nin the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot\u2014Ad\u00e8le knelt near him. Half\r\nreclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion;\r\nhe was looking at Ad\u00e8le and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my\r\ntraveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer\r\nby the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more\r\nremarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought,\r\ncholer; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw\u2014yes, all three were very grim, and no\r\nmistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness\r\nwith his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of\r\nthe term\u2014broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself;\r\nbut it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his\r\nhead as we approached.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere is Miss Eyre, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He bowed, still\r\nnot taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet Miss Eyre be seated,\u201d said he: and there was something in the forced stiff\r\nbow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, \u201cWhat\r\nthe deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am\r\nnot disposed to accost her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would\r\nprobably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering\r\ngrace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation;\r\non the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the\r\nadvantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt\r\ninterested to see how he would go on.\r\n\n\r\nHe went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax\r\nseemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to\r\ntalk. Kindly, as usual\u2014and, as usual, rather trite\u2014she condoled with him on the\r\npressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to\r\nhim with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance\r\nin going through with it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, I should like some tea,\u201d was the sole rejoinder she got. She hastened\r\nto ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups,\r\nspoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Ad\u00e8le went to the table; but\r\nthe master did not leave his couch.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you hand Mr. Rochester\u2019s cup?\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax to me; \u201cAd\u00e8le might\r\nperhaps spill it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Ad\u00e8le, thinking the moment\r\npropitious for making a request in my favour, cried out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cN\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur, qu\u2019il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre\r\npetit coffre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho talks of cadeaux?\u201d said he gruffly. \u201cDid you expect a present, Miss Eyre?\r\nAre you fond of presents?\u201d and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were\r\ndark, irate, and piercing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally\r\nthought pleasant things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGenerally thought? But what do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer\r\nworthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one\r\nshould consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Ad\u00e8le: she demands a \u2018cadeau,\u2019\r\nclamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I have less confidence in my deserts than Ad\u00e8le has: she can prefer\r\nthe claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you\r\nhave always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make\r\nout a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to\r\nentitle me to an acknowledgment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Ad\u00e8le, and find you have\r\ntaken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a\r\nshort time she has made much improvement.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, you have now given me my \u2018cadeau;\u2019 I am obliged to you: it is the meed\r\nteachers most covet\u2014praise of their pupils\u2019 progress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome to the fire,\u201d said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs.\r\nFairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Ad\u00e8le was leading me\r\nby the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the\r\nconsoles and chiffonni\u00e8res. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Ad\u00e8le wanted to take a\r\nseat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have been resident in my house three months?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you came from\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFrom Lowood school, in \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! a charitable concern. How long were you there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEight years.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in such a\r\nplace would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have rather the look\r\nof another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. When you\r\ncame on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and\r\nhad half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure\r\nyet. Who are your parents?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that\r\nstile?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor whom, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did I break\r\nthrough one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cThe men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,\u201d\r\nsaid I, speaking as seriously as he had done. \u201cAnd not even in Hay Lane, or the\r\nfields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don\u2019t think either summer or\r\nharvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed\r\nwondering what sort of talk this was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d resumed Mr. Rochester, \u201cif you disown parents, you must have some sort\r\nof kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; none that I ever saw.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere do your brothers and sisters live?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have no brothers or sisters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho recommended you to come here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, \u201cand I am\r\ndaily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre has been an\r\ninvaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Ad\u00e8le.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself to give her a character,\u201d returned Mr. Rochester:\r\n\u201ceulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my\r\nhorse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have to thank her for this sprain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe widow looked bewildered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you seen much society?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\r\nThornfield.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you read much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very\r\nlearned.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious\r\nforms;\u2014Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would\r\nworship their director.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That sounds\r\nblasphemous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is a harsh\r\nman; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy\u2019s sake\r\nbought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat was very false economy,\u201d remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the\r\ndrift of the dialogue.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd was that the head and front of his offending?\u201d demanded Mr. Rochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\r\ndepartment, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long\r\nlectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing,\r\nabout sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat age were you when you went to Lowood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout ten.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI assented.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cArithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been\r\nable to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the features and\r\ncountenance are so much at variance as in your case. And now what did you learn\r\nat Lowood? Can you play?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course: that is the established answer. Go into the library\u2014I mean, if you\r\nplease.\u2014(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, \u2018Do this,\u2019 and it is\r\ndone: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)\u2014Go, then, into\r\nthe library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the\r\npiano, and play a tune.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI departed, obeying his directions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d he called out in a few minutes. \u201cYou play a little, I see;\r\nlike any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAd\u00e8le showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours. I don\u2019t\r\nknow whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed!\u201d I interjected.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its\r\ncontents being original; but don\u2019t pass your word unless you are certain: I can\r\nrecognise patchwork.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI brought the portfolio from the library.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cApproach the table,\u201d said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Ad\u00e8le and Mrs.\r\nFairfax drew near to see the pictures.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo crowding,\u201d said Mr. Rochester: \u201ctake the drawings from my hand as I finish\r\nwith them; but don\u2019t push your faces up to mine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid aside; the\r\nothers, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,\u201d said he, \u201cand look at them\r\nwith Ad\u00e8le;\u2014you\u201d (glancing at me) \u201cresume your seat, and answer my questions. I\r\nperceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and some\r\nthought.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other\r\noccupation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you get your copies?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOut of my head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat head I see now on your shoulders?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHas it other furniture of the same kind within?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should think it may have: I should hope\u2014better.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.\r\n\n\r\nWhile he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I\r\nmust premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen\r\nvividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to\r\nembody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in\r\neach case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\r\n\n\r\nThese pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and\r\nlivid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too,\r\nwas the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One\r\ngleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a\r\ncormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold\r\nbracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my\r\npalette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.\r\nSinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green\r\nwater; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had\r\nbeen washed or torn.\r\n\n\r\nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with\r\ngrass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an\r\nexpanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman\u2019s\r\nshape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The\r\ndim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through\r\nthe suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed\r\nshadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the\r\nneck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the\r\ntrain of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\r\n\n\r\nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a\r\nmuster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the\r\nhorizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,\u2014a\r\ncolossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin\r\nhands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower\r\nfeatures a sable veil; a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow\r\nand fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were\r\nvisible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery,\r\nvague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,\r\ngemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was \u201cthe\r\nlikeness of a kingly crown;\u201d what it diademed was \u201cthe shape which shape had\r\nnone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere you happy when you painted these pictures?\u201d asked Mr. Rochester\r\npresently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to\r\nenjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few;\r\nbut I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist\u2019s dreamland while you blent and\r\narranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from\r\nmorning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days\r\nfavoured my inclination to apply.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFar from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork:\r\nin each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably.\r\nYou had not enough of the artist\u2019s skill and science to give it full being: yet\r\nthe drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are\r\nelfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could\r\nyou make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above\r\nquells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who\r\ntaught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this\r\nhill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings\r\naway!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, he\r\nsaid abruptly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is nine o\u2019clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Ad\u00e8le sit up so\r\nlong? Take her to bed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress, but\r\nscarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish you all good-night, now,\u201d said he, making a movement of the hand\r\ntowards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to\r\ndismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we\r\ncurtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,\u201d I observed,\r\nwhen I rejoined her in her room, after putting Ad\u00e8le to bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, is he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his\r\nmanner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper,\r\nallowance should be made.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPartly because it is his nature\u2014and we can none of us help our nature; and\r\npartly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his\r\nspirits unequal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFamily troubles, for one thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he has no family.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot now, but he has had\u2014or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder brother a\r\nfew years since.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis elder brother?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the\r\nproperty; only about nine years.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as to be\r\nstill inconsolable for his loss?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no\u2014perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them.\r\nMr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he\r\nprejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and\r\nanxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the\r\nproperty by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have\r\nwealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of\r\nage, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of\r\nmischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into\r\nwhat he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what\r\nthe precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit\r\ncould not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke\r\nwith his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I\r\ndon\u2019t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together,\r\nsince the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate;\r\nand, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy should he shun it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he thinks it gloomy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax\r\neither could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin\r\nand nature of Mr. Rochester\u2019s trials. She averred they were a mystery to\r\nherself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident,\r\nindeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.\r\n\n"}
{"16": "\nCHAPTER XIV\n\r\nFor several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he\r\nseemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from\r\nMillcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.\r\nWhen his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good\r\ndeal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till\r\nlate at night.\r\n\n\r\nDuring this interval, even Ad\u00e8le was seldom sent for to his presence, and all\r\nmy acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall,\r\non the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and\r\ncoldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and\r\nsometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did\r\nnot offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation;\r\nthe ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\r\n\n\r\nOne day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order,\r\ndoubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a\r\npublic meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being\r\nwet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were\r\ngone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Ad\u00e8le were to go downstairs. I\r\nbrushed Ad\u00e8le\u2019s hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was\r\nmyself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch\u2014all being\r\ntoo close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement\u2014we\r\ndescended, Ad\u00e8le wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come;\r\nfor, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was\r\ngratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the\r\ndining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMa boite! ma boite!\u201d exclaimed she, running towards it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, there is your \u2018boite\u2019 at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\r\ndaughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,\u201d said the deep\r\nand rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an\r\nimmense easy-chair at the fireside. \u201cAnd mind,\u201d he continued, \u201cdon\u2019t bother me\r\nwith any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of\r\nthe entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille,\r\nenfant; comprends-tu?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to a sofa\r\nwith her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid. Having\r\nremoved this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper,\r\nshe merely exclaimed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh ciel! Que c\u2019est beau!\u201d and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Miss Eyre there?\u201d now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to\r\nlook round to the door, near which I still stood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! well, come forward; be seated here.\u201d He drew a chair near his own. \u201cI am\r\nnot fond of the prattle of children,\u201d he continued; \u201cfor, old bachelor as I am,\r\nI have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp. It would be\r\nintolerable to me to pass a whole evening t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a brat. Don\u2019t\r\ndraw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it\u2014if\r\nyou please, that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor\r\ndo I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have mine\r\nin mind; it won\u2019t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood\r\nis said to be thicker than water.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,\r\nknitting-basket in hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have forbidden\r\nAd\u00e8le to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion;\r\nhave the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one\r\nof the most benevolent acts you ever performed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her sofa,\r\nand there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen\r\ncontents of her \u201cboite;\u201d pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in\r\nsuch broken English as she was mistress of.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow I have performed the part of a good host,\u201d pursued Mr. Rochester, \u201cput my\r\nguests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend\r\nto my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward:\r\nyou are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in\r\nthis comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the\r\nshade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a\r\nmatter of course to obey him promptly.\r\n\n\r\nWe were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for\r\ndinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all\r\nred and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window\r\nand loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Ad\u00e8le (she\r\ndared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain\r\nagainst the panes.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what\r\nI had seen him look before; not quite so stern\u2014much less gloomy. There was a\r\nsmile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not\r\nsure; but I think it very probable. He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood;\r\nmore expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and\r\nrigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his\r\nmassive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of\r\nthe fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had\r\ngreat, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too\u2014not without a certain change in their\r\ndepths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of\r\nthat feeling.\r\n\n\r\nHe had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same\r\nlength of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on\r\nhis physiognomy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou examine me, Miss Eyre,\u201d said he: \u201cdo you think me handsome?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something\r\nconventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue\r\nbefore I was aware\u2014\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! By my word! there is something singular about you,\u201d said he: \u201cyou have the\r\nair of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit\r\nwith your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except,\r\nby-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for\r\ninstance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are\r\nobliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at\r\nleast brusque. What do you mean by it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was\r\nnot easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that\r\ntastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of\r\nthat sort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed!\r\nAnd so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and\r\nsoothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what\r\nfault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my\r\nfeatures like any other man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed\r\nrepartee: it was only a blunder.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me: does my\r\nforehead not please you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and\r\nshowed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency\r\nwhere the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, ma\u2019am, am I a fool?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFar from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return\r\nwhether you are a philanthropist?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head:\r\nand that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women\r\n(low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I\r\nbear a conscience;\u201d and he pointed to the prominences which are said to\r\nindicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently\r\nconspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head:\r\n\u201cand, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old\r\nas you, I was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered,\r\nand unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me\r\nwith her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an\r\nIndia-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one\r\nsentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHope of what, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDecidedly he has had too much wine,\u201d I thought; and I did not know what answer\r\nto make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being\r\nre-transformed?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any\r\nmore than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is\r\nconvenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my\r\nphysiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.\r\nYoung lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on\r\nthe marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as\r\nhis face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length\r\nof limb. I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there\r\nwas so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such\r\na look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a\r\nreliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone\r\nfor the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one\r\ninevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put\r\nfaith in the confidence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand\r\nthat is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient\r\ncompany for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Ad\u00e8le is\r\na degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am\r\npersuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited\r\nyou down here. I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours\r\nfrom my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what\r\nimportunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out\u2014to\r\nlearn more of you\u2014therefore speak.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInstead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile\r\neither.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak,\u201d he urged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat about, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of\r\ntreating it entirely to yourself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAccordingly I sat and said nothing: \u201cIf he expects me to talk for the mere sake\r\nof talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong\r\nperson,\u201d I thought.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are dumb, Miss Eyre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty\r\nglance seemed to dive into my eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStubborn?\u201d he said, \u201cand annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an\r\nabsurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once\r\nfor all, I don\u2019t wish to treat you like an inferior: that is\u201d (correcting\r\nhimself), \u201cI claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years\u2019\r\ndifference in age and a century\u2019s advance in experience. This is legitimate,\r\net j\u2019y tiens, as Ad\u00e8le would say; and it is by virtue of this\r\nsuperiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to\r\nme a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one\r\npoint\u2014cankering as a rusty nail.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible\r\nto his condescension, and would not seem so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir\u2014quite willing; but I cannot introduce\r\na topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me questions, and I\r\nwill do my best to answer them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a\r\nlittle masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated,\r\nnamely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through\r\na varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the\r\nglobe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo as you please, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive\r\none. Reply clearly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are\r\nolder than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your\r\nclaim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and\r\nexperience.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumph! Promptly spoken. But I won\u2019t allow that, seeing that it would never\r\nsuit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both\r\nadvantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree\r\nto receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of\r\ncommand. Will you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar\u2014he seems to\r\nforget that he pays me \u00a330 per annum for receiving his orders.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe smile is very well,\u201d said he, catching instantly the passing expression;\r\n\u201cbut speak too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire\r\nwhether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPaid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had\r\nforgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to\r\nlet me hector a little?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and\r\nthat you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I\r\nagree heartily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and\r\nphrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather\r\nlike, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore,\r\nkeep to yourself, and don\u2019t venture on generalities of which you are intensely\r\nignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its\r\ninaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the\r\nsubstance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often\r\nsee such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid,\r\ncoarse-minded misapprehension of one\u2019s meaning are the usual rewards of\r\ncandour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have\r\nanswered me as you have just done. But I don\u2019t mean to flatter you: if you are\r\ncast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did\r\nit. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know,\r\nyou may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to\r\ncounterbalance your few good points.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd so may you,\u201d I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind: he\r\nseemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well\r\nas imagined\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, you are right,\u201d said he; \u201cI have plenty of faults of my own: I know\r\nit, and I don\u2019t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I need not be too\r\nsevere about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of\r\nlife to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and\r\ncensures from my neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other\r\ndefaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse\r\ncircumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and\r\nhave never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very\r\ndifferent; I might have been as good as you\u2014wiser\u2014almost as stainless. I envy\r\nyou your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little\r\ngirl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure\u2014an\r\ninexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to\r\nfetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen\u2014quite your equal. Nature meant me to\r\nbe, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I\r\nam not so. You would say you don\u2019t see it; at least I flatter myself I read as\r\nmuch in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am\r\nquick at interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,\u2014I am not a\r\nvillain: you are not to suppose that\u2014not to attribute to me any such bad\r\neminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my\r\nnatural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty\r\ndissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you\r\nwonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life\r\nyou will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your\r\nacquaintances\u2019 secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done,\r\nthat it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk\r\nof themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of\r\ntheir indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting\r\nand encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u2014how can you guess all this, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my\r\nthoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior to\r\ncircumstances; so I should\u2014so I should; but you see I was not. When fate\r\nwronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I\r\ndegenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry\r\nribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to\r\nconfess that he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm\u2014God knows I do!\r\nDread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRepentance is said to be its cure, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform\u2014I have\r\nstrength yet for that\u2014if\u2014but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered,\r\nburdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I\r\nhave a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what\r\nit may.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you will degenerate still more, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPossibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I may get\r\nit as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will sting\u2014it will taste bitter, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u2014you never tried it. How very serious\u2014how very solemn you\r\nlook: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head\u201d (taking one\r\nfrom the mantelpiece). \u201cYou have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that\r\nhave not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its\r\nmysteries.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and\r\nyou pronounced remorse the poison of existence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across\r\nmy brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather than a\r\ntemptation: it was very genial, very soothing\u2014I know that. Here it comes again!\r\nIt is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel\r\nof light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my\r\nheart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDistrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnce more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish\r\nbetween a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal\r\nthrone\u2014between a guide and a seducer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the\r\nsuggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more misery if\r\nyou listen to it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all\u2014it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you\r\nare not my conscience-keeper, so don\u2019t make yourself uneasy. Here, come in,\r\nbonny wanderer!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then,\r\nfolding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he seemed to\r\nenclose in their embrace the invisible being.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, again addressing me, \u201cI have received the pilgrim\u2014a\r\ndisguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me good: my heart was\r\na sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo speak truth, sir, I don\u2019t understand you at all: I cannot keep up the\r\nconversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I know: you\r\nsaid you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your\r\nown imperfection;\u2014one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a\r\nsullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard,\r\nyou would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve;\r\nand that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts\r\nand actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of\r\nrecollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell\r\nwith energy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint. Certainly,\r\nmy associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd better?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd better\u2014so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt\r\nme; I don\u2019t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at\r\nthis moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that\r\nboth are right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of\r\ncombinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is\r\nliable to abuse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are human and fallible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am: so are you\u2014what then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and\r\nperfect alone can be safely intrusted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat power?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,\u2014\u2018Let it be\r\nright.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Let it be right\u2019\u2014the very words: you have pronounced them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay it be right then,\u201d I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to\r\ncontinue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that\r\nthe character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond\r\nits present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity,\r\nwhich accompanies a conviction of ignorance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo put Ad\u00e8le to bed: it is past her bedtime.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly\r\nnot afraid.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are afraid\u2014your self-love dreads a blunder.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn that sense I do feel apprehensive\u2014I have no wish to talk nonsense.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for\r\nsense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don\u2019t trouble yourself to answer\u2014I see\r\nyou laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not\r\nnaturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint\r\nstill clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice,\r\nand restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a\r\nbrother\u2014or father, or master, or what you will\u2014to smile too gaily, speak too\r\nfreely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural\r\nwith me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your\r\nlooks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer\r\nnow. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the\r\nclose-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it\r\nbut free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt has struck nine, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u2014wait a minute: Ad\u00e8le is not ready to go to bed yet. My position,\r\nMiss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours\r\nobservation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Ad\u00e8le (I\r\nhave my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,\u2014reasons that I may, nay,\r\nthat I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten\r\nminutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it;\r\ncoquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of\r\nher bones. \u2018Il faut que je l\u2019essaie!\u2019 cried she, \u2018et \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame!\u2019 and she\r\nrushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in\r\na few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,\u2014a miniature of\r\nC\u00e9line Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of\u2014But never\r\nmind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is\r\nmy presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEre long, Ad\u00e8le\u2019s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She entered,\r\ntransformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very\r\nshort, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown\r\nfrock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her\r\nfeet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce que ma robe va bien?\u201d cried she, bounding forwards; \u201cet mes souliers?\r\net mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd spreading out her dress, she chass\u00e9ed across the room till, having reached\r\nMr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on\r\none knee at his feet, exclaiming\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bont\u00e9;\u201d then rising, she added,\r\n\u201cC\u2019est comme cela que maman faisait, n\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPre-cise-ly!\u201d was the answer; \u201cand, \u2018comme cela,\u2019 she charmed my English gold\r\nout of my British breeches\u2019 pocket. I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,\u2014ay,\r\ngrass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. My\r\nSpring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands,\r\nwhich, in some moods, I would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence\r\nit sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could\r\nmanure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so\r\nartificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic\r\nprinciple of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I\u2019ll\r\nexplain all this some day. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"17": "\nCHAPTER XV\n\r\nMr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one afternoon, when\r\nhe chanced to meet me and Ad\u00e8le in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot\r\nand her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within\r\nsight of her.\r\n\n\r\nHe then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, C\u00e9line Varens,\r\ntowards whom he had once cherished what he called a \u201cgrande passion.\u201d\r\nThis passion C\u00e9line had professed to return with even superior ardour. He\r\nthought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that she\r\npreferred his \u201ctaille d\u2019athl\u00e8te\u201d to the elegance of the Apollo\r\nBelvidere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph\r\nfor her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete\r\nestablishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c.\r\nIn short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any\r\nother spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to\r\nshame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to\r\ndeviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had\u2014as I deserved to have\u2014the fate of\r\nall other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when C\u00e9line did not expect\r\nme, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling\r\nthrough Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air\r\nconsecrated so lately by her presence. No,\u2014I exaggerate; I never thought there\r\nwas any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume\r\nshe had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just\r\nbeginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled\r\nessences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the\r\nbalcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The\r\nbalcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,\u2014I\r\nwill take one now, if you will excuse me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having\r\nplaced it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing\r\nand sunless air, he went on\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was\r\ncroquant\u2014(overlook the barbarism)\u2014croquant chocolate comfits, and\r\nsmoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the\r\nfashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant\r\nclose carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen\r\nin the brilliant city-night, I recognised the \u2018voiture\u2019 I had given C\u00e9line. She\r\nwas returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron\r\nrails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door;\r\nmy flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed\r\nin a cloak\u2014an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening\u2014I\r\nknew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her\r\ndress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over the balcony, I was\r\nabout to murmur \u2018Mon ange\u2019\u2014in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the\r\near of love alone\u2014when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; cloaked\r\nalso; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was\r\na hatted head which now passed under the arched porte coch\u00e8re of the\r\nhotel.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask\r\nyou; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to experience:\r\nyour soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it. You think\r\nall existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has\r\nhitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither\r\nsee the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the\r\nbreakers boil at their base. But I tell you\u2014and you may mark my words\u2014you will\r\ncome some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life\u2019s stream\r\nwill be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be\r\ndashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave\r\ninto a calmer current\u2014as I am now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness\r\nof the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its\r\nretirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey fa\u00e7ade, and\r\nlines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I\r\nabhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house? How I do\r\nstill abhor\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his boot\r\nagainst the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and\r\nto hold him so tightly that he could not advance.\r\n\n\r\nWe were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.\r\nLifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I never\r\nsaw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed\r\nmomentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his\r\nebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another\r\nfeeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and\r\nresolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he went on\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDuring the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my\r\ndestiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk\u2014a hag like one of those who\r\nappeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. \u2018You like Thornfield?\u2019 she said,\r\nlifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid\r\nhieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of\r\nwindows, \u2018Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will like it,\u2019 said I; \u2018I dare like it;\u2019 and\u201d (he subjoined moodily) \u201cI\r\nwill keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness\u2014yes,\r\ngoodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job\u2019s\r\nleviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others\r\ncount as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le here ran before him with her shuttlecock. \u201cAway!\u201d he cried harshly; \u201ckeep\r\nat a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!\u201d Continuing then to pursue his walk\r\nin silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence he had abruptly\r\ndiverged\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you leave the balcony, sir,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhen Mdlle. Varens entered?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the\r\ncontrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes towards\r\nme, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. \u201cOh, I had forgotten C\u00e9line!\r\nWell, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier,\r\nI seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating\r\ncoils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in\r\ntwo minutes to my heart\u2019s core. Strange!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly starting again\r\nfrom the point. \u201cStrange that I should choose you for the confidant of all\r\nthis, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if\r\nit were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of\r\nhis opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last\r\nsingularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your\r\ngravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.\r\nBesides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own:\r\nI know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a\r\nunique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take\r\nharm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot\r\nblight you, you may refresh me.\u201d After this digression he proceeded\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI remained in the balcony. \u2018They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,\u2019 thought\r\nI: \u2018let me prepare an ambush.\u2019 So putting my hand in through the open window, I\r\ndrew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take\r\nobservations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to\r\nfurnish an outlet to lovers\u2019 whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and\r\nas I resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. C\u00e9line\u2019s\r\nchamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The\r\ncouple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there\r\nwas \u2018the Varens,\u2019 shining in satin and jewels,\u2014my gifts of course,\u2014and there\r\nwas her companion in an officer\u2019s uniform; and I knew him for a young rou\u00e9 of a\r\nvicomte\u2014a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and\r\nhad never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On\r\nrecognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because\r\nat the same moment my love for C\u00e9line sank under an extinguisher. A woman who\r\ncould betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved\r\nonly scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,\r\nmercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than\r\nenrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived,\r\nbrought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed energy or wit to\r\nbelabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their\r\nlittle way: especially C\u00e9line, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal\r\ndefects\u2014deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to launch out\r\ninto fervent admiration of what she called my \u2018beaut\u00e9 m\u00e2le:\u2019 wherein she\r\ndiffered diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second\r\ninterview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the\r\ntime and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le here came running up again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to\r\nsee you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon them;\r\nliberated C\u00e9line from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel;\r\noffered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics,\r\nprayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a\r\nmeeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of\r\nencountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as\r\nthe wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole\r\ncrew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette\r\nAd\u00e8le, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see\r\nno proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like\r\nme than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her\r\nchild, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no\r\nnatural claim on Ad\u00e8le\u2019s part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge\r\nany, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e\u2019en\r\ntook the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it\r\nhere, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs.\r\nFairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate\r\noffspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your\r\npost and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have\r\nfound another place\u2014that you beg me to look out for a new governess,\r\n&c.\u2014Eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: Ad\u00e8le is not answerable for either her mother\u2019s faults or yours: I have a\r\nregard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parentless\u2014forsaken by\r\nher mother and disowned by you, sir\u2014I shall cling closer to her than before.\r\nHow could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate\r\nher governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her\r\nas a friend?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you\r\ntoo: it darkens.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I stayed out a few minutes longer with Ad\u00e8le and Pilot\u2014ran a race with her,\r\nand played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went in, and I had\r\nremoved her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour,\r\nallowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms\r\nand trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which\r\nbetrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her\r\nmother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I\r\nwas disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in\r\nher countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no\r\ntrait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she\r\ncould but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I\r\nsteadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was\r\nprobably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself:\r\na wealthy Englishman\u2019s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him,\r\nwere every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something\r\ndecidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when\r\nhe was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his\r\nnewly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated\r\nwonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the\r\npresent inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master\u2019s manner to\r\nmyself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to\r\nmy discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for\r\nsome weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in\r\nhis way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly,\r\nthe encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for\r\nme: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a\r\ncordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse\r\nhim, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as\r\nfor my benefit.\r\n\n\r\nI, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. It\r\nwas his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted\r\nwith the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt\r\nscenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale\r\non which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were\r\ncharacterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered,\r\nin imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought\r\nthrough the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious\r\nallusion.\r\n\n\r\nThe ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness,\r\nas correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him. I felt at\r\ntimes as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious\r\nsometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so\r\ngratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to\r\npine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of\r\nexistence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and\r\nstrength.\r\n\n\r\nAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many\r\nassociations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked\r\nto see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I\r\nhad not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them\r\nfrequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every\r\ndescription: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was\r\nbalanced by unjust severity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably\r\nso; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his\r\nlibrary alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a\r\nmorose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that\r\nhis moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say\r\nformer, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some\r\ncruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies,\r\nhigher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed,\r\neducation instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent\r\nmaterials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled\r\nand tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and\r\nwould have given much to assuage it.\r\n\n\r\nThough I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not\r\nsleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told how his\r\ndestiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at Thornfield.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked myself. \u201cWhat alienates him from the house? Will he leave it\r\nagain soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at\r\na time; and he has now been resident eight weeks. If he does go, the change\r\nwill be doleful. Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how\r\njoyless sunshine and fine days will seem!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I\r\nstarted wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which\r\nsounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the\r\nnight was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in bed,\r\nlistening. The sound was hushed.\r\n\n\r\nI tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was\r\nbroken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed my\r\nchamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way\r\nalong the dark gallery outside. I said, \u201cWho is there?\u201d Nothing answered. I was\r\nchilled with fear.\r\n\n\r\nAll at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door\r\nchanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of\r\nMr. Rochester\u2019s chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings. The\r\nidea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an\r\nunbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the\r\nreturn of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream\r\nhad scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a\r\nmarrow-freezing incident enough.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a demoniac laugh\u2014low, suppressed, and deep\u2014uttered, as it seemed, at\r\nthe very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was near the door, and\r\nI thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside\u2014or rather, crouched\r\nby my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I\r\nstill gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind\r\nthe panels. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to\r\ncry out, \u201cWho is there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSomething gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards\r\nthe third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that\r\nstaircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?\u201d thought I.\r\nImpossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried\r\non my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a\r\ntrembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in\r\nthe gallery. I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed\r\nto perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to\r\nthe right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became\r\nfurther aware of a strong smell of burning.\r\n\n\r\nSomething creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester\u2019s, and\r\nthe smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I\r\nthought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the\r\nchamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In\r\nthe midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep\r\nsleep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWake! wake!\u201d I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the smoke\r\nhad stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I\r\nrushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and\r\nboth were filled with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its\r\noccupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the\r\ncouch afresh, and, by God\u2019s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which\r\nwere devouring it.\r\n\n\r\nThe hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from\r\nmy hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I\r\nhad liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. Though it was now dark, I\r\nknew he was awake; because I heard him fulminating strange anathemas at finding\r\nhimself lying in a pool of water.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there a flood?\u201d he cried.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I answered; \u201cbut there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched\r\nnow; I will fetch you a candle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?\u201d he demanded.\r\n\u201cWhat have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the room besides you?\r\nHave you plotted to drown me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven\u2019s name, get up. Somebody has\r\nplotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes\r\ntill I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be\u2014yes, here is my\r\ndressing-gown. Now run!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He took it\r\nfrom my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the\r\nsheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it? and who did it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\nI briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in\r\nthe gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,\u2014the smell of\r\nfire which had conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters\r\nthere, and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHe listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than\r\nastonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I call Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she do? Let\r\nher sleep unmolested.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm enough,\r\nyou may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair:\r\nthere,\u2014I will put it on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of\r\nthe wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain\r\nwhere you are till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the\r\nsecond storey. Don\u2019t move, remember, or call any one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very softly,\r\nunclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after\r\nhim, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for\r\nsome noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was\r\ncold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I\r\nwas not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester\u2019s\r\ndispleasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on\r\nthe gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. \u201cI hope it is\r\nhe,\u201d thought I, \u201cand not something worse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe re-entered, pale and very gloomy. \u201cI have found it all out,\u201d said he,\r\nsetting his candle down on the washstand; \u201cit is as I thought.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground. At the\r\nend of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think,\r\nor something like it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,\u2014she laughs in\r\nthat way. She is a singular person.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust so. Grace Poole\u2014you have guessed it. She is, as you say, singular\u2014very.\r\nWell, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad that you are the only\r\nperson, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night\u2019s\r\nincident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it. I will account for\r\nthis state of affairs\u201d (pointing to the bed): \u201cand now return to your own room.\r\nI shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It\r\nis near four:\u2014in two hours the servants will be up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, then, sir,\u201d said I, departing.\r\n\n\r\nHe seemed surprised\u2014very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to go.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201care you quitting me already, and in that way?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said I might go, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and\r\ngood-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, you have saved my\r\nlife!\u2014snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! and you walk past me\r\nas if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in both\r\nhis own.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I\r\ncannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in\r\nthe character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;\u2014I\r\nfeel your benefits no burden, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,\u2014but his\r\nvoice was checked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the\r\ncase.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI knew,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou would do me good in some way, at some time;\u2014I saw\r\nit in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did\r\nnot\u201d\u2014(again he stopped)\u2014\u201cdid not\u201d (he proceeded hastily) \u201cstrike delight to my\r\nvery inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies; I have\r\nheard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My\r\ncherished preserver, good-night!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStrange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad I happened to be awake,\u201d I said: and then I was going.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! you will go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am cold, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCold? Yes,\u2014and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!\u201d But he still retained\r\nmy hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an expedient.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, leave me:\u201d he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.\r\n\n\r\nI regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I was\r\ntossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under\r\nsurges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet\r\nas the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope,\r\nbore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even\r\nin fancy\u2014a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.\r\nSense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest,\r\nI rose as soon as day dawned.\r\n\n"}
{"18": "\nCHAPTER XVI\n\r\nI both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this\r\nsleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye.\r\nDuring the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was\r\nnot in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a\r\nfew minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it\r\nthat day.\r\n\n\r\nBut the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet\r\ncourse of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester\u2019s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s voice, and Leah\u2019s,\r\nand the cook\u2019s\u2014that is, John\u2019s wife\u2014and even John\u2019s own gruff tones. There were\r\nexclamations of \u201cWhat a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!\u201d \u201cIt is always\r\ndangerous to keep a candle lit at night.\u201d \u201cHow providential that he had\r\npresence of mind to think of the water-jug!\u201d \u201cI wonder he waked nobody!\u201d \u201cIt is\r\nto be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,\u201d &c.\r\n\n\r\nTo much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and\r\nwhen I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open\r\ndoor that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped\r\nof its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass\r\ndimmed with smoke. I was about to address her, for I wished to know what\r\naccount had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person\r\nin the chamber\u2014a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to\r\nnew curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.\r\n\n\r\nThere she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown,\r\nher check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in\r\nwhich her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her\r\ncommonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one\r\nwould have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted\r\nmurder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and\r\n(as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was\r\namazed\u2014confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no\r\nincrease or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear\r\nof detection. She said \u201cGood morning, Miss,\u201d in her usual phlegmatic and brief\r\nmanner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will put her to some test,\u201d thought I: \u201csuch absolute impenetrability is\r\npast comprehension.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood morning, Grace,\u201d I said. \u201cHas anything happened here? I thought I heard\r\nthe servants all talking together a while ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his\r\ncandle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the\r\nbed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with\r\nthe water in the ewer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA strange affair!\u201d I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly\u2014\u201cDid\r\nMr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of\r\nconsciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she\r\nanswered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to\r\nhear. Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room and yours are the nearest to master\u2019s; but Mrs.\r\nFairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep\r\nheavy.\u201d She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but\r\nstill in a marked and significant tone\u2014\u201cBut you are young, Miss; and I should\r\nsay a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the\r\npanes, could not hear me, \u201cand at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot\r\ncannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle\r\nwith a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he was in\r\nsuch danger: You must have been dreaming.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was not dreaming,\u201d I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\r\nprovoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\r\nconscious eye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you told master that you heard a laugh?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?\u201d she\r\nfurther asked.\r\n\n\r\nShe appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information\r\nunawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her\r\nguilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it\r\nadvisable to be on my guard.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said I, \u201cI bolted my door.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get\r\ninto bed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!\u201d\r\nIndignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, \u201cHitherto I have\r\noften omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary. I was not aware\r\nany danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future\u201d\r\n(and I laid marked stress on the words) \u201cI shall take good care to make all\r\nsecure before I venture to lie down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will be wise so to do,\u201d was her answer: \u201cthis neighbourhood is as quiet as\r\nany I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it\r\nwas a house; though there are hundreds of pounds\u2019 worth of plate in the\r\nplate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are\r\nvery few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does\r\ncome, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best\r\nto err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a\r\ndrawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people,\r\nMiss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not\r\ndispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used\r\ndiscreetly.\u201d And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered\r\nwith the demureness of a Quakeress.\r\n\n\r\nI still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous\r\nself-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Poole,\u201d said she, addressing Grace, \u201cthe servants\u2019 dinner will soon be\r\nready: will you come down?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I\u2019ll carry it\r\nupstairs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have some meat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the sago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I\u2019ll make it\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me: so I\r\ndeparted.\r\n\n\r\nI hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s account of the curtain conflagration during\r\ndinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical\r\ncharacter of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her\r\nposition at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody\r\nthat morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master\u2019s service. He\r\nhad almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night:\r\nwhat mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me,\r\ntoo, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman\r\nseemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so much in\r\nher power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not\r\nopenly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.\r\n\n\r\nHad Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that\r\ntenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf;\r\nbut, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted.\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d I reflected, \u201cshe has been young once; her youth would be contemporary\r\nwith her master\u2019s: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I\r\ndon\u2019t think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may\r\npossess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of\r\npersonal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:\r\nGrace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to\r\na nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and\r\nshe now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own\r\nindiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?\u201d But, having\r\nreached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole\u2019s square, flat figure, and\r\nuncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind\u2019s eye, that\r\nI thought, \u201cNo; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,\u201d suggested\r\nthe secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, \u201cyou are not\r\nbeautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have\r\noften felt as if he did; and last night\u2014remember his words; remember his look;\r\nremember his voice!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly\r\nrenewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Ad\u00e8le was drawing; I bent over her and\r\ndirected her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQu\u2019avez-vous, mademoiselle?\u201d said she. \u201cVos doigts tremblent comme la feuille,\r\net vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am hot, Ad\u00e8le, with stooping!\u201d She went on sketching; I went on thinking.\r\n\n\r\nI hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving\r\nrespecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her, and found\r\nwe were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke\r\ntruth\u2014I was a lady. And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me;\r\nI had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had\r\nbrighter hopes and keener enjoyments.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEvening approaches,\u201d said I, as I looked towards the window. \u201cI have never\r\nheard Mr. Rochester\u2019s voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see\r\nhim before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because\r\nexpectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen dusk actually closed, and when Ad\u00e8le left me to go and play in the nursery\r\nwith Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring\r\nbelow; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I\r\nheard Mr. Rochester\u2019s own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open\r\nand admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the\r\nwindow. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o\u2019clock,\r\nand it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night,\r\nwhen I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the\r\nsubject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him\r\nplainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night\u2019s hideous\r\nattempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered\r\nwhether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing\r\nhim by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always\r\nprevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never\r\nventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every\r\nminute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him\r\nin argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.\r\n\n\r\nA tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it was\r\nonly to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room. Thither I repaired,\r\nglad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr.\r\nRochester\u2019s presence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must want your tea,\u201d said the good lady, as I joined her; \u201cyou ate so\r\nlittle at dinner. I am afraid,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou are not well to-day: you\r\nlook flushed and feverish.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, quite well! I never felt better.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot\r\nwhile I knit off this needle?\u201d Having completed her task, she rose to draw down\r\nthe blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the\r\nmost of daylight, though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is fair to-night,\u201d said she, as she looked through the panes, \u201cthough not\r\nstarlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his\r\njourney.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJourney!\u2014Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas, Mr.\r\nEshton\u2019s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe there is quite\r\na party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and\r\nothers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you expect him back to-night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or\r\nmore: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded\r\nby elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and\r\nentertain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen especially are often in\r\nrequest on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in\r\nsociety, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of\r\nhim; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him\r\nparticularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities,\r\nperhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre there ladies at the Leas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters\u2014very elegant young ladies\r\nindeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful\r\nwomen, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when\r\nshe was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr.\r\nRochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day\u2014how richly it was\r\ndecorated, how brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and\r\ngentlemen present\u2014all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was\r\nconsidered the belle of the evening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was\r\nChristmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some\r\nof the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat\r\ndown in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the\r\nladies were magnificently dressed; most of them\u2014at least most of the younger\r\nones\u2014looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what was she like?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion,\r\ndark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester\u2019s: large and\r\nblack, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of\r\nhair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind,\r\nand in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in\r\npure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her\r\nbreast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.\r\nShe wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with\r\nthe jetty mass of her curls.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was greatly admired, of course?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments. She was\r\none of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and\r\nMr. Rochester sang a duet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen\r\nto her;\u2014and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester\r\nis; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes.\r\nOld Lord Ingram\u2019s estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for\r\neverything almost.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her: Mr.\r\nRochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester\r\nis nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat of that? More unequal matches are made every day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the\r\nsort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester\r\nand the beautiful Blanche; but Ad\u00e8le came in, and the conversation was turned\r\ninto another channel.\r\n\n\r\nWhen once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into my\r\nheart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a\r\nstrict hand such as had been straying through imagination\u2019s boundless and\r\ntrackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.\r\n\n\r\nArraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes, wishes,\r\nsentiments I had been cherishing since last night\u2014of the general state of mind\r\nin which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason having come forward\r\nand told, in her own quiet way, a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had\r\nrejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;\u2014I pronounced judgment to\r\nthis effect:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nThat a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that\r\na more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies, and swallowed\r\npoison as if it were nectar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d I said, \u201ca favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted with\r\nthe power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Go! your\r\nfolly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of\r\npreference\u2014equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the\r\nworld to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!\u2014Could not\r\neven self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the\r\nbrief scene of last night?\u2014Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in\r\npraise of your eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on\r\nyour own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by\r\nher superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all\r\nwomen to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and\r\nunknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded\r\nto, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no\r\nextrication.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cListen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before\r\nyou, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one\r\ndefect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write\r\nunder it, \u2018Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory\u2014you have one prepared in your\r\ndrawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints;\r\nchoose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest\r\nface you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines,\r\naccording to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember\r\nthe raven ringlets, the oriental eye;\u2014What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a\r\nmodel! Order! No snivel!\u2014no sentiment!\u2014no regret! I will endure only sense and\r\nresolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and\r\nbust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit\r\nneither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,\r\na\u00ebrial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it\r\n\u2018Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of\r\nyou, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, \u2018Mr. Rochester might\r\nprobably win that noble lady\u2019s love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely\r\nhe would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew calm,\r\nand fell asleep.\r\n\n\r\nI kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons;\r\nand in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary\r\nBlanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real\r\nhead in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-control could desire. I\r\nderived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had\r\ngiven force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on\r\nmy heart.\r\n\n\r\nEre long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome\r\ndiscipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I\r\nwas able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they\r\nfound me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even\r\nexternally.\r\n\n"}
{"19": "\nCHAPTER XVII\n\r\nA week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still he did\r\nnot come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go\r\nstraight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his\r\nface again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it\r\nin a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning\r\nto feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting\r\nmyself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,\r\nand recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it\r\nwas wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder\u2014how I cleared up the mistake\r\nof supposing Mr. Rochester\u2019s movements a matter in which I had any cause to\r\ntake a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of\r\ninferiority: on the contrary, I just said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive\r\nthe salary he gives you for teaching his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and to be grateful for such\r\nrespectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to\r\nexpect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges\r\nbetween you and him; so don\u2019t make him the object of your fine feelings, your\r\nraptures, agonies, and so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste,\r\nand be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and\r\nstrength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI went on with my day\u2019s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague\r\nsuggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit\r\nThornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering\r\nconjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they\r\nmight germinate and bear fruit if they could.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought\r\nMrs. Fairfax a letter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is from the master,\u201d said she, as she looked at the direction. \u201cNow I\r\nsuppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my\r\ncoffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that\r\ncircumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand shook,\r\nand why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did\r\nnot choose to consider.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy\r\nenough now: for a little while at least,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the\r\nnote before her spectacles.\r\n\n\r\nEre I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s\r\npinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to another bun and\r\nrefilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed he is\u2014in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone\r\neither. I don\u2019t know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with\r\nhim: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the\r\nlibrary and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands\r\nfrom the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies\r\nwill bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full\r\nhouse of it.\u201d And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to\r\ncommence operations.\r\n\n\r\nThe three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the\r\nrooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was\r\nmistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such\r\nwashing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of\r\npictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in\r\nbedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld,\r\neither before or since. Ad\u00e8le ran quite wild in the midst of it: the\r\npreparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her\r\ninto ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her \u201ctoilettes,\u201d as she\r\ncalled frocks; to furbish up any that were \u201cpass\u00e9es,\u201d and to air and\r\narrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front\r\nchambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up\r\nbolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From\r\nschool duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service,\r\nand I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her and the cook;\r\nlearning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and\r\ngarnish desert-dishes.\r\n\n\r\nThe party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at\r\nsix. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I\r\nbelieve I was as active and gay as anybody\u2014Ad\u00e8le excepted. Still, now and then,\r\nI received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself,\r\nthrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This\r\nwas when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had\r\nalways been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace\r\nPoole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide\r\nalong the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her\r\nlook into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,\u2014just say a word, perhaps, to the\r\ncharwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble\r\nmantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would\r\nthus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe\r\non the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her\r\nprivate solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the\r\ntwenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her\r\ntime was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there\r\nshe sat and sewed\u2014and probably laughed drearily to herself,\u2014as companionless as\r\na prisoner in his dungeon.\r\n\n\r\nThe strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,\r\nnoticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her position\r\nor employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, indeed,\r\noverheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which\r\nGrace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and\r\nthe charwoman remarked\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe gets good wages, I guess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Leah; \u201cI wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\r\nof,\u2014there\u2019s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they\u2019re not one fifth of the sum\r\nMrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank\r\nat Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her\r\nindependent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she\u2019s got used to the place;\r\nand then she\u2019s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon\r\nfor her to give up business.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a good hand, I daresay,\u201d said the charwoman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u2014she understands what she has to do,\u2014nobody better,\u201d rejoined Leah\r\nsignificantly; \u201cand it is not every one could fill her shoes\u2014not for all the\r\nmoney she gets.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat it is not!\u201d was the reply. \u201cI wonder whether the master\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she\r\ninstantly gave her companion a nudge.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t she know?\u201d I heard the woman whisper.\r\n\n\r\nLeah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I had\r\ngathered from it amounted to this,\u2014that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and\r\nthat from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.\r\n\n\r\nThursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were\r\nlaid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet\r\ntables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and\r\nsaloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them. The hall, too, was\r\nscoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the\r\nstaircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the\r\nsideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir,\r\nvases of exotics bloomed on all sides.\r\n\n\r\nAfternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves,\r\nand her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company,\u2014to conduct the\r\nladies to their rooms, &c. Ad\u00e8le, too, would be dressed: though I thought\r\nshe had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least.\r\nHowever, to please her, I allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short,\r\nfull muslin frocks. For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not\r\nbe called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now\r\nbecome to me,\u2014\u201ca very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt had been a mild, serene spring day\u2014one of those days which, towards the end\r\nof March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of\r\nsummer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat\r\nat work in the schoolroom with the window open.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt gets late,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. \u201cI am glad I\r\nordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past\r\nsix now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the\r\nroad: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.\u201d She\r\nwent to the window. \u201cHere he is!\u201d said she. \u201cWell, John\u201d (leaning out), \u201cany\r\nnews?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the answer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here in ten minutes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so\r\nthat, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\r\n\n\r\nThe ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard;\r\nfour equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages.\r\nFluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers\r\nwere young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his\r\nblack horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and\r\nhe and she were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept\r\nthe ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent\r\nfolds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Ingram!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.\r\n\n\r\nThe cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of\r\nthe house, and I lost sight of it. Ad\u00e8le now petitioned to go down; but I took\r\nher on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not on any account\r\nthink of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time,\r\nunless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c.\r\n\u201cSome natural tears she shed\u201d on being told this; but as I began to look very\r\ngrave, she consented at last to wipe them.\r\n\n\r\nA joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen\u2019s deep tones and ladies\u2019\r\nsilvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all,\r\nthough not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall,\r\nwelcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended\r\nthe stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful\r\nlaughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElles changent de toilettes,\u201d said Ad\u00e8le; who, listening attentively, had\r\nfollowed every movement; and she sighed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChez maman,\u201d said she, \u201cquand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au\r\nsalon et \u00e0 leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer\r\net habiller les dames, et c\u2019\u00e9tait si amusant: comme cela on apprend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel hungry, Ad\u00e8le?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais oui, mademoiselle: voil\u00e0 cinq ou six heures que nous n\u2019avons pas mang\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and get you\r\nsomething to eat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which\r\nconducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and commotion;\r\nthe soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over\r\nher crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion.\r\nIn the servants\u2019 hall two coachmen and three gentlemen\u2019s gentlemen stood or sat\r\nround the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses;\r\nthe new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about\r\neverywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took\r\npossession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a\r\nknife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the\r\ngallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum\r\nwarned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not\r\nproceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the\r\nrisk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this\r\nend, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and\r\ntwilight gathering.\r\n\n\r\nPresently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came\r\nout gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a\r\nmoment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery,\r\nconversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the\r\nstaircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their\r\ncollective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such\r\nas I had never before received.\r\n\n\r\nI found Ad\u00e8le peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar. \u201cWhat\r\nbeautiful ladies!\u201d cried she in English. \u201cOh, I wish I might go to them! Do you\r\nthink Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-by, after dinner?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed, I don\u2019t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never\r\nmind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your\r\ndinner.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her attention\r\nfor a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I, and Sophie, to\r\nwhom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no\r\ndinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The\r\ndessert was not carried out till after nine; and at ten footmen were still\r\nrunning to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Ad\u00e8le to sit up much\r\nlater than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the\r\ndoors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she\r\nadded, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed;\r\n\u201cet alors quel dommage!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I\r\ntook her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to\r\nlook over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards.\r\nWhen the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the\r\ndrawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Ad\u00e8le and I sat down on the\r\ntop step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones\r\nof the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The\r\nsolo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur\r\nfilled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was\r\nwholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate\r\namidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught\r\nthem, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered\r\nby distance inarticulate, into words.\r\n\n\r\nThe clock struck eleven. I looked at Ad\u00e8le, whose head leant against my\r\nshoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried\r\nher off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their\r\nchambers.\r\n\n\r\nThe next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an\r\nexcursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out early in the\r\nforenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the\r\ndeparture and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian;\r\nand, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart\r\nfrom the rest. I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was\r\nstanding at the window with me\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said it was not likely they should think of being married,\u201d said I, \u201cbut\r\nyou see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd she him,\u201d I added; \u201clook how she leans her head towards him as if she were\r\nconversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have never had a\r\nglimpse of it yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will see her this evening,\u201d answered Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cI happened to remark\r\nto Mr. Rochester how much Ad\u00e8le wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he\r\nsaid: \u2018Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss\r\nEyre to accompany her.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,\u201d I answered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not think\r\nyou would like appearing before so gay a party\u2014all strangers; and he replied,\r\nin his quick way\u2014\u2018Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish;\r\nand if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will not give him that trouble,\u201d I answered. \u201cI will go, if no better may\r\nbe; but I don\u2019t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I\u2019ll tell you how to manage so as\r\nto avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most\r\ndisagreeable part of the business. You must go into the drawing-room while it\r\nis empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any\r\nquiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless\r\nyou please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away\u2014nobody\r\nwill notice you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill these people remain long, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter recess, Sir\r\nGeorge Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to\r\ntown and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it\r\nsurprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to\r\nrepair with my charge to the drawing-room. Ad\u00e8le had been in a state of ecstasy\r\nall day, after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening;\r\nand it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she\r\nsobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by\r\nthe time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her\r\npink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she\r\nlooked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:\r\nwhen she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care\r\npreviously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and\r\nassured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my\r\nbest dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple\u2019s wedding, and never\r\nworn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the\r\npearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.\r\n\n\r\nFortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through\r\nthe saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the apartment vacant;\r\na large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in\r\nbright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned.\r\nThe crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this\r\ndrapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a\r\nkey that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing\r\nmurmur.\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising\r\nimpression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her. I\r\nretired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to\r\nread. Ad\u00e8le brought her stool to my feet; ere long she touched my knee.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Ad\u00e8le?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\r\nmademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think too much of your \u2018toilette,\u2019 Ad\u00e8le: but you may have a flower.\u201d And\r\nI took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of\r\nineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full. I turned my\r\nface away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something\r\nludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne\u2019s earnest and innate\r\ndevotion to matters of dress.\r\n\n\r\nA soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the\r\narch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down\r\nlight on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long\r\ntable; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain\r\nfell behind them.\r\n\n\r\nThere were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\r\nimpression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were\r\ndressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to\r\nmagnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to\r\nthem: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.\r\n\n\r\nThey dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of\r\ntheir movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves\r\nin half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the\r\ntables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round\r\nthe fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I\r\nknew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evidently been a\r\nhandsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her daughters, the eldest,\r\nAmy, was rather little: na\u00efve, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant\r\nin form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well. The second,\r\nLouisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that\r\norder the French term minois chiffon\u00e9: both sisters were fair as lilies.\r\n\n\r\nLady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very\r\nhaughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her dark\r\nhair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet\r\nof a band of gems.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She had a\r\nslight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her\r\nscarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the\r\nrainbow radiance of the titled dame.\r\n\n\r\nBut the three most distinguished\u2014partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures\r\nof the band\u2014were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary.\r\nThey were all three of the loftiest stature of women. The Dowager might be\r\nbetween forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at\r\nleast) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people\r\nwould have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt,\r\nphysically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable\r\nhaughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double\r\nchin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me\r\nnot only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was\r\nsustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural\r\nerectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs.\r\nReed\u2019s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was deep, its inflections\r\nvery pompous, very dogmatical,\u2014very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet\r\nrobe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I\r\nsuppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.\r\n\n\r\nBlanche and Mary were of equal stature,\u2014straight and tall as poplars. Mary was\r\ntoo slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded her,\r\nof course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance\r\naccorded with Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s description; secondly, whether it at all resembled\r\nthe fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly\u2014it will out!\u2014whether it\r\nwere such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester\u2019s taste.\r\n\n\r\nAs far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture and\r\nMrs. Fairfax\u2019s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful\r\nneck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;\u2014but her face? Her face\r\nwas like her mother\u2019s; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the\r\nsame high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride!\r\nshe laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual\r\nexpression of her arched and haughty lip.\r\n\n\r\nGenius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a\r\ngenius, but she was self-conscious\u2014remarkably self-conscious indeed. She\r\nentered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs.\r\nDent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers,\r\n\u201cespecially wild ones;\u201d Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with\r\nan air. I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed)\r\ntrailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance; her trail\r\nmight be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her\r\nexecution was brilliant; she sang: her voice was fine; she talked French apart\r\nto her mamma; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.\r\n\n\r\nMary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too,\r\nand a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)\u2014but Mary was\r\ndeficient in life: her face lacked expression, her eye lustre; she had nothing\r\nto say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in its\r\nniche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.\r\n\n\r\nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely\r\nto make? I could not tell\u2014I did not know his taste in female beauty. If he\r\nliked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then she was\r\naccomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that\r\nhe did admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove\r\nthe last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.\r\n\n\r\nYou are not to suppose, reader, that Ad\u00e8le has all this time been sitting\r\nmotionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she rose,\r\nadvanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon jour, mesdames.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed, \u201cOh,\r\nwhat a little puppet!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nLady Lynn had remarked, \u201cIt is Mr. Rochester\u2019s ward, I suppose\u2014the little\r\nFrench girl he was speaking of.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and Louisa\r\nEshton had cried out simultaneously\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat a love of a child!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced between\r\nthem, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only\r\nthe young ladies\u2019 attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting\r\nspoilt to her heart\u2019s content.\r\n\n\r\nAt last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in the\r\nshade\u2014if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\r\nwindow-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The collective\r\nappearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they\r\nare all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young. Henry and\r\nFrederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine\r\nsoldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like:\r\nhis hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him\r\nsomething of the appearance of a \u201cp\u00e8re noble de th\u00e9\u00e2tre.\u201d Lord Ingram, like his\r\nsisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary\u2019s\r\napathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity\r\nof blood or vigour of brain.\r\n\n\r\nAnd where is Mr. Rochester?\r\n\n\r\nHe comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I try to\r\nconcentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I\r\nam forming\u2014I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the\r\nsilver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold\r\nhis figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I\r\nhad rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my\r\nhand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart\r\nfull and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I\r\napproached him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change\r\nhis and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!\r\nSo far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me. I did not\r\nwonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the\r\nroom, and began conversing with some of the ladies.\r\n\n\r\nNo sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might\r\ngaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face;\r\nI could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would\r\nfix on him. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,\u2014a precious yet\r\npoignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like\r\nwhat the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has\r\ncrept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\r\n\n\r\nMost true is it that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the gazer.\u201d My master\u2019s\r\ncolourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep\r\neyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,\u2014all energy, decision, will,\u2014were not\r\nbeautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they\r\nwere full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me,\u2014that took my\r\nfeelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love\r\nhim; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of\r\nlove there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they\r\nspontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\nI compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the\r\nlanguid elegance of Lord Ingram,\u2014even the military distinction of Colonel Dent,\r\ncontrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power? I had no sympathy in\r\ntheir appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers\r\nwould call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.\r\nRochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile,\r\nlaugh\u2014it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their\r\nsmile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr.\r\nRochester smile:\u2014his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and\r\ngentle, its ray both searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to\r\nLouisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which\r\nseemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to\r\nrise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. \u201cHe is\r\nnot to them what he is to me,\u201d I thought: \u201che is not of their kind. I believe\r\nhe is of mine;\u2014I am sure he is\u2014I feel akin to him\u2014I understand the language of\r\nhis countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have\r\nsomething in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me\r\nmentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him\r\nbut to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in\r\nany other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good,\r\ntrue, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must\r\nconceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care\r\nmuch for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have\r\nhis force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have\r\ncertain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat\r\ncontinually that we are for ever sundered:\u2014and yet, while I breathe and think,\r\nI must love him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nCoffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively\r\nas larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue\r\non politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady\r\nIngram, confabulate together. Sir George\u2014whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to\r\ndescribe,\u2014a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before\r\ntheir sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick\r\nLynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of\r\na splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little.\r\nThe tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of\r\nthe little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a\r\nwren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken\r\npossession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Ad\u00e8le shares it with him: he is\r\ntrying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom\r\nwill Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending\r\ngracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait\r\ntoo long: she herself selects a mate.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as\r\nshe stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite\r\nside of the mantelpiece.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor am I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?\u201d\r\n(pointing to Ad\u00e8le). \u201cWhere did you pick her up?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou should have sent her to school.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could not afford it: schools are so dear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just\r\nnow\u2014is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-curtain. You pay\r\nher, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,\u2014more so; for you have\r\nthem both to keep in addition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI feared\u2014or should I say, hoped?\u2014the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester\r\nglance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never\r\nturned his eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not considered the subject,\u201d said he indifferently, looking straight\r\nbefore him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama\r\non the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at\r\nleast in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all\r\nincubi\u2014were they not, mama?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you speak, my own?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe young lady thus claimed as the dowager\u2019s special property, reiterated her\r\nquestion with an explanation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest, don\u2019t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I have\r\nsuffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have\r\nnow done with them!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her ear;\r\nI suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the\r\nanathematised race was present.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTant pis!\u201d said her Ladyship, \u201cI hope it may do her good!\u201d Then, in a lower\r\ntone, but still loud enough for me to hear, \u201cI noticed her; I am a judge of\r\nphysiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they, madam?\u201d inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you in your private ear,\u201d replied she, wagging her turban three\r\ntimes with portentous significancy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAsk Blanche; she is nearer you than I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the whole\r\ntribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took\r\ncare to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss\r\nWilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to\r\njoin in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson\r\nwas a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of\r\nvanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took\r\neffect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions,\r\nwhen we had driven her to extremities\u2014spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and\r\nbutter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the\r\nruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember those\r\nmerry days?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYaas, to be sure I do,\u201d drawled Lord Ingram; \u201cand the poor old stick used to\r\ncry out, \u2018Oh you villains childs!\u2019\u2014and then we sermonised her on the\r\npresumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was\r\nherself so ignorant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or persecuting) your\r\ntutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining\u2014the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. He\r\nand Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other\u2014at least\r\nTedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we\r\ninterpreted as tokens of \u2018la belle passion,\u2019 and I promise you the public soon\r\nhad the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist\r\nour dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an\r\ninkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did you\r\nnot, my lady-mother?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\r\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be\r\ntolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste, we all know\r\nthem: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and\r\nconsequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached\u2014mutual alliance and\r\nreliance; confidence thence resulting\u2014insolence accompanying\u2014mutiny and general\r\nblow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy lily-flower, you are right now, as always.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen no more need be said: change the subject.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft,\r\ninfantine tone: \u201cLouisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such\r\na good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out. She was never\r\ncross with us; was she, Louisa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and\r\nturn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, she would give us\r\nanything we asked for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, now,\u201d said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, \u201cwe shall\r\nhave an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to\r\navert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr.\r\nRochester, do you second my motion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, I support you on this point, as on every other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are you in\r\nvoice to-night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and\r\nother vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA fig for Rizzio!\u201d cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as she\r\nmoved to the piano. \u201cIt is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an\r\ninsipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is\r\nnothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say what it will\r\nof James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort of wild, fierce,\r\nbandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?\u201d cried Mr.\r\nRochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should say the preference lies with you,\u201d responded Colonel Dent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn my honour, I am much obliged to you,\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\r\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant\r\nprelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high horse to-night; both\r\nher words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but\r\nthe amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as\r\nsomething very dashing and daring indeed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!\u201d exclaimed she, rattling\r\naway at the instrument. \u201cPoor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond\r\npapa\u2019s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama\u2019s permission and\r\nguardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their\r\nwhite hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty!\r\nAs if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman\u2014her legitimate\r\nappanage and heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face\r\nof creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess\r\nonly strength and valour: let their motto be:\u2014Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest\r\nis not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhenever I marry,\u201d she continued after a pause which none interrupted, \u201cI am\r\nresolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I will suffer no\r\ncompetitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions\r\nshall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr.\r\nRochester, now sing, and I will play for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am all obedience,\u201d was the response.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that\r\nreason, sing it con spirito.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCommands from Miss Ingram\u2019s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and\r\nwater.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake care, then: if you don\u2019t please me, I will shame you by showing how such\r\nthings should be done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate\r\npunishment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a\r\nchastisement beyond mortal endurance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! explain!\u201d commanded the lady.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you\r\nthat one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital\r\npunishment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSing!\u201d said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an accompaniment\r\nin spirited style.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow is my time to slip away,\u201d thought I: but the tones that then severed the\r\nair arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he\r\ndid\u2014a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own\r\nforce; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation\r\nstrangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired\u2014till the\r\ntide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my\r\nsheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.\r\nThence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my\r\nsandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the\r\nmat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a\r\ngentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr.\r\nRochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you do?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am very well, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you not come and speak to me in the room?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I would not\r\ntake that freedom. I answered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you been doing during my absence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular; teaching Ad\u00e8le as usual.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd getting a good deal paler than you were\u2014as I saw at first sight. What is\r\nthe matter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing at all, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you take any cold that night you half drowned me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot the least.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cReturn to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am tired, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at me for a minute.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd a little depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about? Tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing\u2014nothing, sir. I am not depressed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring\r\ntears to your eyes\u2014indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead\r\nhas slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag. If I had time, and was not\r\nin mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what\r\nall this means. Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my\r\nvisitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is\r\nmy wish; don\u2019t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Ad\u00e8le. Good-night, my\u2014\u201d\r\nHe stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\r\n\n"}
{"20": "\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\r\nMerry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from\r\nthe first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed\r\nbeneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy\r\nassociations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long. You\r\ncould not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front\r\nchambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady\u2019s-maid or a\r\ndandy valet.\r\n\n\r\nThe kitchen, the butler\u2019s pantry, the servants\u2019 hall, the entrance hall, were\r\nequally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky\r\nand halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out\r\ninto the grounds. Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in\r\nfor some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only\r\nbecame more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor\r\ngaiety.\r\n\n\r\nI wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\r\nentertainment was proposed: they spoke of \u201cplaying charades,\u201d but in my\r\nignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the\r\ndining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs\r\nplaced in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other\r\ngentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down\r\nstairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information\r\nrespecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any\r\nkind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their\r\ncontents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black\r\nmodes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails;\r\nthen a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\r\nboudoir within the drawing-room.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was\r\nselecting certain of their number to be of his party. \u201cMiss Ingram is mine, of\r\ncourse,\u201d said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He\r\nlooked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of\r\nMrs. Dent\u2019s bracelet, which had got loose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you play?\u201d he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I rather\r\nfeared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.\r\n\n\r\nHe and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was\r\nheaded by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of the\r\ngentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked\r\nto join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I heard her say: \u201cshe looks too stupid for any game of the sort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEre long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the bulky\r\nfigure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen\r\nenveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a large book; and\r\nat his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester\u2019s cloak, and holding a\r\nbook in her hand. Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Ad\u00e8le (who had\r\ninsisted on being one of her guardian\u2019s party), bounded forward, scattering\r\nround her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then\r\nappeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on\r\nher head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\r\nRochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent\r\nand Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them. A\r\nceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the\r\npantomime of a marriage. At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party\r\nconsulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBride!\u201d Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\r\n\n\r\nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\r\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The drawing-room, as\r\nI have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the\r\ntop of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a\r\nlarge marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory\u2014where\r\nit usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish\u2014and whence\r\nit must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and\r\nweight.\r\n\n\r\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,\r\ncostumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes and swarthy skin\r\nand Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very model of an\r\nEastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into\r\nview Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf\r\ntied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her\r\ntemples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\r\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and\r\nfeature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some\r\nIsraelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the\r\ncharacter she intended to represent.\r\n\n\r\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she again\r\nlifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost\r\nher; to make some request:\u2014\u201cShe hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and\r\ngave him to drink.\u201d From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket,\r\nopened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment\r\nand admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and\r\ndelight were expressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the\r\nbracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca:\r\nthe camels only were wanting.\r\n\n\r\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not\r\nagree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel Dent, their\r\nspokesman, demanded \u201cthe tableau of the whole;\u201d whereupon the curtain again\r\ndescended.\r\n\n\r\nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest\r\nbeing concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery.\r\nThe marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table and a kitchen\r\nchair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn\r\nlantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.\r\n\n\r\nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his\r\nknees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; though the\r\nbegrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if\r\nit had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling\r\ncountenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him. As he\r\nmoved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBridewell!\u201d exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\r\n\n\r\nA sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\r\nordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss\r\nIngram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d said she, \u201cthat, of the three characters, I liked you in the\r\nlast best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant\r\ngentleman-highwayman you would have made!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs all the soot washed from my face?\u201d he asked, turning it towards her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlas! yes: the more\u2019s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your\r\ncomplexion than that ruffian\u2019s rouge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would like a hero of the road then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit;\r\nand that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since,\r\nin the presence of all these witnesses.\u201d She giggled, and her colour rose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Dent,\u201d continued Mr. Rochester, \u201cit is your turn.\u201d And as the other party\r\nwithdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss Ingram placed herself at\r\nher leader\u2019s right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of\r\nhim and her. I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest\r\nfor the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes,\r\nerewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle\r\nof chairs. What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they\r\nchose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the\r\nconsultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss\r\nIngram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him, till\r\nthe jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear\r\ntheir mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something\r\neven of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.\r\n\n\r\nI have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not\r\nunlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\u2014because\r\nI might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my\r\ndirection\u2014because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who\r\nscorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her\r\ndark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as\r\nfrom an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I\r\nfelt sure he would soon marry this very lady\u2014because I read daily in her a\r\nproud security in his intentions respecting her\u2014because I witnessed hourly in\r\nhim a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought\r\nthan to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very\r\npride, irresistible.\r\n\n\r\nThere was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to\r\ncreate despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a\r\nwoman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram\u2019s.\r\nBut I was not jealous: or very rarely;\u2014the nature of the pain I suffered could\r\nnot be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was\r\ntoo inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I\r\nsay. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many\r\nbrilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature:\r\nnothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\r\nby its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat\r\nsounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own.\r\nShe advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of\r\nsympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed\r\nthis, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived\r\nagainst little Ad\u00e8le: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she\r\nhappened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always\r\ntreating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these\r\nmanifestations of character\u2014watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the\r\nfuture bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a\r\nceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity\u2014this guardedness of\r\nhis\u2014this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one\u2019s defects\u2014this obvious\r\nabsence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain\r\narose.\r\n\n\r\nI saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons, because\r\nher rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her his love, and\r\nthat her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure. This\r\nwas the point\u2014this was where the nerve was touched and teased\u2014this was where\r\nthe fever was sustained and fed: she could not charm him.\r\n\n\r\nIf she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid\r\nhis heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and\r\n(figuratively) have died to them. If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble\r\nwoman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one\r\nvital struggle with two tigers\u2014jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out\r\nand devoured, I should have admired her\u2014acknowledged her excellence, and been\r\nquiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the\r\ndeeper would have been my admiration\u2014the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But\r\nas matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram\u2019s efforts at fascinating Mr.\r\nRochester, to witness their repeated failure\u2014herself unconscious that they did\r\nfail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly\r\npluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled\r\nfurther and further what she wished to allure\u2014to witness this, was to be\r\nat once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\r\n\n\r\nBecause, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows that\r\ncontinually glanced off from Mr. Rochester\u2019s breast and fell harmless at his\r\nfeet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his proud\r\nheart\u2014have called love into his stern eye, and softness into his sardonic face;\r\nor, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to\r\nhim?\u201d I asked myself. \u201cSurely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with\r\ntrue affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her\r\nglances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so\r\nmultitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his\r\nside, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his\r\nface a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so\r\nvivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by\r\nmeretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it\u2014to\r\nanswer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without\r\ngrimace\u2014and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a\r\nfostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I\r\ndo not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife\r\nmight, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester\u2019s project of\r\nmarrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first discovered\r\nthat such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced\r\nby motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered\r\nthe position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in\r\njudging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas\r\nand principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their\r\nclass held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding\r\nthem such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like\r\nhim, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\r\nobviousness of the advantages to the husband\u2019s own happiness offered by this\r\nplan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of\r\nwhich I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I\r\nwished to act.\r\n\n\r\nBut in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master:\r\nI was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It\r\nhad formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character: to take the\r\nbad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable\r\njudgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that\r\nhad startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their\r\npresence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.\r\nAnd as for the vague something\u2014was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or\r\na desponding expression?\u2014that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in\r\nhis eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially\r\ndisclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had\r\nbeen wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground\r\nquiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and\r\nwith throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun,\r\nI longed only to dare\u2014to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because\r\none day she might look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and\r\nanalyse their nature.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride\u2014saw only them,\r\nheard only their discourse, and considered only their movements of\r\nimportance\u2014the rest of the party were occupied with their own separate\r\ninterests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in\r\nsolemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held\r\nup their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror,\r\naccording to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified\r\npuppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two\r\nsometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel\r\nDent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\r\nbusiness. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and\r\nwith one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant\r\nspeeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their\r\nby-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr.\r\nRochester and\u2014because closely connected with him\u2014Miss Ingram were the life and\r\nsoul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible\r\ndulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was\r\nsure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.\r\n\n\r\nThe want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that\r\nhe had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till\r\nlate. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a\r\ngipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred.\r\nSome of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with\r\nthe younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers\r\nIngram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after\r\nhaving repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and\r\nMrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some\r\nsentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from\r\nthe library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared\r\nto beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence. The room and\r\nthe house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players\r\nwas heard from above.\r\n\n\r\nIt was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to\r\ndress for dinner, when little Ad\u00e8le, who knelt by me in the drawing-room\r\nwindow-seat, suddenly exclaimed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,\r\nlooked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of\r\nwheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A\r\npost-chaise was approaching.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can possess him to come home in that style?\u201d said Miss Ingram. \u201cHe rode\r\nMesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with\r\nhim:\u2014what has he done with the animals?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the\r\nwindow, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in\r\nher eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her\r\nlip and moved to another casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the\r\ndoor-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not\r\nMr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow provoking!\u201d exclaimed Miss Ingram: \u201cyou tiresome monkey!\u201d (apostrophising\r\nAd\u00e8le), \u201cwho perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?\u201d and she\r\ncast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.\r\n\n\r\nSome parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered. He\r\nbowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen my friend,\r\nMr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think\r\nI may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here\r\ntill he returns.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat\r\nunusual,\u2014not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: his age might\r\nbe about Mr. Rochester\u2019s,\u2014between thirty and forty; his complexion was\r\nsingularly sallow: otherwise he was a fine-looking man, at first sight\r\nespecially. On closer examination, you detected something in his face that\r\ndispleased, or rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too\r\nrelaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a\r\ntame, vacant life\u2014at least so I thought.\r\n\n\r\nThe sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after\r\ndinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease. But I liked his\r\nphysiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time\r\nunsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and had no meaning in its wandering:\r\nthis gave him an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen. For a\r\nhandsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there\r\nwas no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in\r\nthat aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,\r\neven forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\r\n\n\r\nAs I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles\r\non the mantelpiece beaming full over him\u2014for he occupied an arm-chair drawn\r\nclose to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold, I\r\ncompared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the\r\ncontrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon:\r\nbetween a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\r\n\n\r\nHe had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs\r\nmust have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that \u201cextremes\r\nmeet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTwo or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of\r\ntheir conversation across the room. At first I could not make much sense of\r\nwhat I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat\r\nnearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals.\r\nThese last were discussing the stranger; they both called him \u201ca beautiful\r\nman.\u201d Louisa said he was \u201ca love of a creature,\u201d and she \u201cadored him;\u201d and Mary\r\ninstanced his \u201cpretty little mouth, and nice nose,\u201d as her ideal of the\r\ncharming.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!\u201d cried Louisa,\u2014\u201cso smooth\u2014none of\r\nthose frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and\r\nsmile!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of\r\nthe room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.\r\n\n\r\nI was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I\r\npresently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that\r\nhe was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country:\r\nwhich was the reason, doubtless, his face was so sallow, and that he sat so\r\nnear the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica,\r\nKingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was\r\nwith no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and\r\nbecome acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend\u2019s dislike of the\r\nburning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.\r\nRochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the\r\ncontinent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a\r\nhint given of visits to more distant shores.\r\n\n\r\nI was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one,\r\nbroke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to\r\nopen the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out\r\nits flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red. The footman who\r\nbrought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton\u2019s chair, and said\r\nsomething to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, \u201cold\r\nwoman,\u201d\u2014\u201cquite troublesome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off,\u201d\r\nreplied the magistrate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014stop!\u201d interrupted Colonel Dent. \u201cDon\u2019t send her away, Eshton; we might\r\nturn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.\u201d And speaking aloud, he\r\ncontinued\u2014\u201cLadies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp;\r\nSam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants\u2019 hall at\r\nthis moment, and insists upon being brought in before \u2018the quality,\u2019 to tell\r\nthem their fortunes. Would you like to see her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely, colonel,\u201d cried Lady Ingram, \u201cyou would not encourage such a low\r\nimpostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,\u201d said the footman; \u201cnor can any\r\nof the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating her to be gone;\r\nbut she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir\r\nher from it till she gets leave to come in here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d asked Mrs. Eshton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To tell the gentry their fortunes,\u2019 she says, ma\u2019am; and she swears she must\r\nand will do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is she like?\u201d inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, she\u2019s a real sorceress!\u201d cried Frederick Lynn. \u201cLet us have her in, of\r\ncourse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d rejoined his brother; \u201cit would be a thousand pities to throw\r\naway such a chance of fun.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear boys, what are you thinking about?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,\u201d chimed in the\r\nDowager Ingram.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, mama, but you can\u2014and will,\u201d pronounced the haughty voice of Blanche,\r\nas she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had sat silent,\r\napparently examining sundry sheets of music. \u201cI have a curiosity to hear my\r\nfortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy darling Blanche! recollect\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do\u2014I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will\u2014quick, Sam!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014yes!\u201d cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. \u201cLet her\r\ncome\u2014it will be excellent sport!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe footman still lingered. \u201cShe looks such a rough one,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\r\n\n\r\nExcitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and\r\njests was proceeding when Sam returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe won\u2019t come now,\u201d said he. \u201cShe says it\u2019s not her mission to appear before\r\nthe \u2018vulgar herd\u2019 (them\u2019s her words). I must show her into a room by herself,\r\nand then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see now, my queenly Blanche,\u201d began Lady Ingram, \u201cshe encroaches. Be\r\nadvised, my angel girl\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShow her into the library, of course,\u201d cut in the \u201cangel girl.\u201d \u201cIt is not my\r\nmission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have her all\r\nto myself. Is there a fire in the library?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2014but she looks such a tinkler.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once\r\nmore.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s ready now,\u201d said the footman, as he reappeared. \u201cShe wishes to know who\r\nwill be her first visitor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,\u201d said\r\nColonel Dent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSam went and returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe says, sir, that she\u2019ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves\r\nto come near her; nor,\u201d he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, \u201cany\r\nladies either, except the young, and single.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove, she has taste!\u201d exclaimed Henry Lynn.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Ingram rose solemnly: \u201cI go first,\u201d she said, in a tone which might have\r\nbefitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause\u2014reflect!\u201d was her mama\u2019s cry; but she swept\r\npast her in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held\r\nopen, and we heard her enter the library.\r\n\n\r\nA comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it \u201cle cas\u201d to wring her\r\nhands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for her part,\r\nshe never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath, and\r\nlooked a little frightened.\r\n\n\r\nThe minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-door\r\nagain opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.\r\n\n\r\nWould she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a glance of\r\neager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she\r\nlooked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it\r\nin silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Blanche?\u201d said Lord Ingram.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she say, sister?\u201d asked Mary.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?\u201d demanded\r\nthe Misses Eshton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, now, good people,\u201d returned Miss Ingram, \u201cdon\u2019t press upon me. Really\r\nyour organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the\r\nimportance of you all\u2014my good mama included\u2014ascribe to this matter, absolutely\r\nto believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with\r\nthe old gentleman. I have seen a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed\r\nfashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My\r\nwhim is gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in\r\nthe stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMiss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further\r\nconversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she\r\nnever turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and\r\nmore sourly expressive of disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything\r\nto her advantage: and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and\r\ntaciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed indifference,\r\nattached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nMeantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go alone;\r\nand yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of\r\nthe ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said\r\nSam\u2019s calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with\r\ngreat difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon\r\nher in a body.\r\n\n\r\nTheir visit was not so still as Miss Ingram\u2019s had been: we heard hysterical\r\ngiggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of\r\nabout twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the\r\nhall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure she is something not right!\u201d they cried, one and all. \u201cShe told us\r\nsuch things! She knows all about us!\u201d and they sank breathless into the various\r\nseats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\r\n\n\r\nPressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of things they\r\nhad said and done when they were mere children; described books and ornaments\r\nthey had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had\r\npresented to them. They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and\r\nhad whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the\r\nworld, and informed them of what they most wished for.\r\n\n\r\nHere the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened\r\non these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations,\r\ntremors, and titters, in return for their importunity. The matrons, meantime,\r\noffered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the\r\nexpression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and\r\nthe elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the\r\nagitated fair ones.\r\n\n\r\nIn the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in\r\nthe scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and saw Sam.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single\r\nlady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go\r\ntill she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it.\r\nWhat shall I tell her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I will go by all means,\u201d I answered: and I was glad of the unexpected\r\nopportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped out of the room,\r\nunobserved by any eye\u2014for the company were gathered in one mass about the\r\ntrembling trio just returned\u2014and I closed the door quietly behind me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you like, miss,\u201d said Sam, \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the hall for you; and if she\r\nfrightens you, just call and I\u2019ll come in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.\u201d Nor was I; but\r\nI was a good deal interested and excited.\r\n\n"}
{"21": "\nCHAPTER XIX\n\r\nThe library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl\u2014if Sibyl she\r\nwere\u2014was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-corner. She had\r\non a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied\r\ndown with a striped handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood\r\non the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little\r\nblack book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the\r\nwords to herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist\r\nimmediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.\r\n\n\r\nI stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at\r\na distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in\r\nmy life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy\u2019s appearance to trouble one\u2019s\r\ncalm. She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her\r\nface, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked\r\nall brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which\r\npassed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye\r\nconfronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and you want your fortune told?\u201d she said, in a voice as decided as her\r\nglance, as harsh as her features.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn\r\nyou, I have no faith.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your\r\nstep as you crossed the threshold.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you? You\u2019ve a quick ear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need them all in your trade.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do; especially when I\u2019ve customers like you to deal with. Why don\u2019t you\r\ntremble?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn pale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not sick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you consult my art?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not silly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe old crone \u201cnichered\u201d a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then drew\r\nout a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having indulged a while\r\nin this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the pipe from her lips, and\r\nwhile gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProve it,\u201d I rejoined.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes\r\nthe fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings,\r\nthe highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you. You are\r\nsilly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will\r\nyou stir one step to meet it where it waits you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking with\r\nvigour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary\r\ndependent in a great house.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any one?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn my circumstances.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another precisely\r\nplaced as you are.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would be easy to find you thousands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated:\r\nvery near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are all prepared;\r\nthere only wants a movement to combine them. Chance laid them somewhat apart;\r\nlet them be once approached and bliss results.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I must cross it with silver, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she took out\r\nof her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she told me to hold\r\nout my hand. I did. She approached her face to the palm, and pored over it\r\nwithout touching it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is too fine,\u201d said she. \u201cI can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost\r\nwithout lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in\r\nthe lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! now you are coming to reality,\u201d I said, as I obeyed her. \u201cI shall begin to\r\nput some faith in you presently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a ripple of\r\nlight broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw\r\nher face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,\u201d she said, when she had\r\nexamined me a while. \u201cI wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all\r\nthe hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like\r\nshapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between\r\nyou and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the\r\nactual substance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of\r\nthe future?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up\r\na school some day in a little house rented by myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat\r\n(you see I know your habits)\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have learned them from the servants.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an\r\nacquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI started to my feet when I heard the name.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have\u2014have you?\u201d thought I; \u201cthere is diablerie in the business after all,\r\nthen!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d continued the strange being; \u201cshe\u2019s a safe hand is Mrs.\r\nPoole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But, as I was\r\nsaying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future\r\nschool? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas\r\nand chairs before you? Is there not one face you study? one figure whose\r\nmovements you follow with at least curiosity?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI like to observe all the faces and all the figures.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut do you never single one from the rest\u2014or it may be, two?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it\r\namuses me to watch them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat tale do you like best to hear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same theme\u2014courtship;\r\nand promise to end in the same catastrophe\u2014marriage.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you like that monotonous theme?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPositively, I don\u2019t care about it: it is nothing to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with\r\nbeauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the\r\neyes of a gentleman you\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know\u2014and perhaps think well of.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with\r\none of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and\r\nstately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but\r\ncertainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they\r\nplease, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment\r\nto me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable with one\r\nof them? Will you say that of the master of the house!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is not at home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning,\r\nand will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him\r\nfrom the list of your acquaintance\u2014blot him, as it were, out of existence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had\r\nintroduced.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many\r\nsmiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester\u2019s eyes that they overflow like two\r\ncups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all the\r\ntales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most\r\nlively and the most continuous?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.\u201d I said this\r\nrather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by\r\nthis time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected sentence came from her\r\nlips after another, till I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered\r\nwhat unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings\r\nand taking record of every pulse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEagerness of a listener!\u201d repeated she: \u201cyes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the\r\nhour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their\r\ntask of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked\r\nso grateful for the pastime given him; you have noticed this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGrateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDetecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not\r\ngratitude?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said nothing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have seen love: have you not?\u2014and, looking forward, you have seen him\r\nmarried, and beheld his bride happy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumph! Not exactly. Your witch\u2019s skill is rather at fault sometimes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil have you seen, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr.\r\nRochester is to be married?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShortly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAppearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an\r\naudacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will\r\nbe a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome, noble, witty,\r\naccomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not his person, at least\r\nhis purse. I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last\r\ndegree; though (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an\r\nhour ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half\r\nan inch. I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes,\r\nwith a longer or clearer rent-roll,\u2014he\u2019s dished\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester\u2019s fortune: I came to hear my\r\nown; and you have told me nothing of it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait\r\ncontradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know.\r\nI knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it carefully on one\r\nside for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand,\r\nand take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again\r\non the rug.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep me long; the fire scorches me.\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nI knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her\r\nchair. She began muttering,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full\r\nof feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows\r\nimpression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an\r\nunconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting\r\nfrom loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it\r\nseems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already\r\nmade,\u2014to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and\r\nreserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart\r\nall that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent on much the\r\nheart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed\r\nin the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and\r\nsmile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is\r\npropitious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes\r\nto say,\u2014\u2018I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to\r\ndo. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with\r\nme, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or\r\noffered only at a price I cannot afford to give.\u2019 The forehead declares,\r\n\u2018Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst\r\naway and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true\r\nheathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things:\r\nbut judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting\r\nvote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:\r\nbut I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the\r\ndictates of conscience.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have formed my\r\nplans\u2014right plans I deem them\u2014and in them I have attended to the claims of\r\nconscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom\r\nperish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour\r\nof remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution\u2014such\r\nis not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight\u2014to earn gratitude, not to\r\nwring tears of blood\u2014no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in\r\nendearments, in sweet\u2014That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite\r\ndelirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I\r\ndare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly\r\nswore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss\r\nEyre: leave me; \u2018the play is played out.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhere was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream still? The\r\nold woman\u2019s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and all were familiar\r\nto me as my own face in a glass\u2014as the speech of my own tongue. I got up, but\r\ndid not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her\r\nbonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.\r\nThe flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for\r\ndiscoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of\r\neld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers,\r\nsymmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping\r\nforward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again\r\nI looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me\u2014on the contrary, the\r\nbonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jane, do you know me?\u201d asked the familiar voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly take off the red cloak, sir, and then\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the string is in a knot\u2014help me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBreak it, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, then\u2014\u2018Off, ye lendings!\u2019\u201d And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his\r\ndisguise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, what a strange idea!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut well carried out, eh? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith the ladies you must have managed well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut not with you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not act the character of a gipsy with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat character did I act? My own?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying to draw\r\nme out\u2014or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is\r\nscarcely fair, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you forgive me, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I\r\nhave fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not\r\nright.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you have been very correct\u2014very careful, very sensible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, I\r\nhad been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview. Something of\r\nmasquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express\r\nthemselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself; besides I had noted\r\nher feigned voice, her anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been\r\nrunning on Grace Poole\u2014that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I\r\nconsidered her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat are you musing about? What does that grave smile\r\nsignify?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are\r\ndoing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDiscussing the gipsy, I daresay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit down!\u2014Let me hear what they said about me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o\u2019clock. Oh, are you\r\naware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this\r\nmorning?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA stranger!\u2014no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of\r\ninstalling himself here till you returned.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe devil he did! Did he give his name?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town,\r\nin Jamaica, I think.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead me to a\r\nchair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his lips\r\nfroze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMason!\u2014the West Indies!\u201d he said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking\r\nautomaton to enounce its single words; \u201cMason!\u2014the West Indies!\u201d he reiterated;\r\nand he went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of\r\nspeaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly seemed to know what he was doing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you feel ill, sir?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I\u2019ve got a blow; I\u2019ve got a blow, Jane!\u201d He staggered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, lean on me, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, yes; and my arm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his own, he\r\nchafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary\r\nlook.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little friend!\u201d said he, \u201cI wish I were in a quiet island with only you;\r\nand trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I help you, sir?\u2014I\u2019d give my life to serve you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, if aid is wanted, I\u2019ll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir. Tell me what to do,\u2014I\u2019ll try, at least, to do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at\r\nsupper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is doing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester\r\nhad said; they were not seated at table,\u2014the supper was arranged on the\r\nsideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood about here and there in\r\ngroups, their plates and glasses in their hands. Every one seemed in high glee;\r\nlaughter and conversation were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the\r\nfire, talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I\r\nfilled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she\r\nthought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester\u2019s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more firm\r\nand stern. He took the glass from my hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere is to your health, ministrant spirit!\u201d he said. He swallowed the contents\r\nand returned it to me. \u201cWhat are they doing, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLaughing and talking, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe was laughing too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTurn them out of the room, sir, if I could.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe half smiled. \u201cBut if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me\r\ncoldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and\r\nleft me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo comfort me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should care\r\nnothing about it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, you could dare censure for my sake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you,\r\nI am sure, do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear\r\nthat Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then\r\nleave me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight among them.\r\nI sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I\r\nushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.\r\n\n\r\nAt a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair\r\nto their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester\u2019s voice, and heard him say,\r\n\u201cThis way, Mason; this is your room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon asleep.\r\n\n"}
{"22": "\nCHAPTER XX\n\r\nI had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let down\r\nmy window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and\r\nbright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky\r\nopposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her\r\nglorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her\r\ndisk\u2014silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half\r\nrose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.\r\n\n\r\nGood God! What a cry!\r\n\n\r\nThe night\u2014its silence\u2014its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a\r\nshrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\r\n\n\r\nMy pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed. The cry\r\ndied, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek\r\ncould not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could,\r\ntwice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie.\r\nThe thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.\r\n\n\r\nIt came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And overhead\u2014yes, in\r\nthe room just above my chamber-ceiling\u2014I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it\r\nseemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHelp! help! help!\u201d three times rapidly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill no one come?\u201d it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went\r\non wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRochester! Rochester! for God\u2019s sake, come!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. Another step\r\nstamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.\r\n\n\r\nI had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my\r\napartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs\r\nsounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another\r\nlooked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their\r\nbeds; and \u201cOh! what is it?\u201d\u2014\u201cWho is hurt?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\u2014\u201cFetch a\r\nlight!\u201d\u2014\u201cIs it fire?\u201d\u2014\u201cAre there robbers?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhere shall we run?\u201d was demanded\r\nconfusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight they would have been in complete\r\ndarkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some\r\nstumbled: the confusion was inextricable.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere the devil is Rochester?\u201d cried Colonel Dent. \u201cI cannot find him in his\r\nbed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere! here!\u201d was shouted in return. \u201cBe composed, all of you: I\u2019m coming.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with\r\na candle: he had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to\r\nhim directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat awful event has taken place?\u201d said she. \u201cSpeak! let us know the worst at\r\nonce!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t pull me down or strangle me,\u201d he replied: for the Misses Eshton were\r\nclinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were\r\nbearing down on him like ships in full sail.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll\u2019s right!\u2014all\u2019s right!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about\r\nNothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself by an\r\neffort, he added\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She\u2019s an excitable, nervous\r\nperson: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something of that sort,\r\nno doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, I must see you all back\r\ninto your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after.\r\nGentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am\r\nsure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa,\r\nreturn to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames\u201d (to the\r\ndowagers), \u201cyou will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill\r\ngallery any longer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get them\r\nall once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did not wait to be\r\nordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.\r\n\n\r\nNot, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\r\ncarefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been\r\nuttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had proceeded from the\r\nroom above mine: but they assured me that it was not a servant\u2019s dream which\r\nhad thus struck horror through the house; and that the explanation Mr.\r\nRochester had given was merely an invention framed to pacify his guests. I\r\ndressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by\r\nthe window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting\r\nfor I knew not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange\r\ncry, struggle, and call.\r\n\n\r\nNo: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in about\r\nan hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It seemed that sleep\r\nand night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon declined: she was about\r\nto set. Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down\r\non my bed, dressed as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise\r\nacross the carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped\r\nlow at the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I wanted?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you up?\u201d asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd dressed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome out, then, quietly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want you,\u201d he said: \u201ccome this way: take your time, and make no noise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat. He\r\nglided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor\r\nof the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his side.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you a sponge in your room?\u201d he asked in a whisper.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you any salts\u2014volatile salts?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo back and fetch both.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer, and\r\nonce more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his hand:\r\napproaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock; he paused,\r\nand addressed me again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t turn sick at the sight of blood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust give me your hand,\u201d he said: \u201cit will not do to risk a fainting fit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI put my fingers into his. \u201cWarm and steady,\u201d was his remark: he turned the key\r\nand opened the door.\r\n\n\r\nI saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax showed me\r\nover the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was now looped up\r\nin one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then been concealed. This\r\ndoor was open; a light shone out of the room within: I heard thence a snarling,\r\nsnatching sound, almost like a dog quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his\r\ncandle, said to me, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d and he went forward to the inner\r\napartment. A shout of laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and\r\nterminating in Grace Poole\u2019s own goblin ha! ha! She then was there. He\r\nmade some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice\r\naddress him: he came out and closed the door behind him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere, Jane!\u201d he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed,\r\nwhich with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber.\r\nAn easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it, dressed with the\r\nexception of his coat; he was still; his head leant back; his eyes were closed.\r\nMr. Rochester held the candle over him; I recognised in his pale and seemingly\r\nlifeless face\u2014the stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side, and\r\none arm, was almost soaked in blood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHold the candle,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin of\r\nwater from the washstand: \u201cHold that,\u201d said he. I obeyed. He took the sponge,\r\ndipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked for my\r\nsmelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his\r\neyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm\r\nand shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there immediate danger?\u201d murmured Mr. Mason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh! No\u2014a mere scratch. Don\u2019t be so overcome, man: bear up! I\u2019ll fetch a\r\nsurgeon for you now, myself: you\u2019ll be able to be removed by morning, I hope.\r\nJane,\u201d he continued.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or\r\nperhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns: if he\r\nfeels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his lips, and\r\nyour salts to his nose. You will not speak to him on any pretext\u2014and\u2014Richard,\r\nit will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her: open your\r\nlips\u2014agitate yourself\u2014and I\u2019ll not answer for the consequences.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear, either of\r\ndeath or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him. Mr. Rochester put\r\nthe now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to use it as he had done.\r\nHe watched me a second, then saying, \u201cRemember!\u2014No conversation,\u201d he left the\r\nroom. I experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the\r\nsound of his retreating step ceased to be heard.\r\n\n\r\nHere then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic cells;\r\nnight around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands; a\r\nmurderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes\u2014that was appalling\u2014the\r\nrest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out\r\nupon me.\r\n\n\r\nI must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly countenance\u2014these\r\nblue, still lips forbidden to unclose\u2014these eyes now shut, now opening, now\r\nwandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness\r\nof horror. I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water,\r\nand wipe away the trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle\r\nwane on my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry\r\nround me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver\r\nstrangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite\u2014whose front, divided into\r\ntwelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each\r\nenclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top rose\r\nan ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\r\n\n\r\nAccording as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or\r\nglanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his brow; now\r\nSt. John\u2019s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew\r\nout of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the\r\narch-traitor\u2014of Satan himself\u2014in his subordinate\u2019s form.\r\n\n\r\nAmidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the movements\r\nof the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since Mr. Rochester\u2019s\r\nvisit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three\r\nlong intervals,\u2014a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine\r\nnoise, and a deep human groan.\r\n\n\r\nThen my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived incarnate in\r\nthis sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the\r\nowner?\u2014what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the\r\ndeadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary\r\nwoman\u2019s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of\r\na carrion-seeking bird of prey?\r\n\n\r\nAnd this man I bent over\u2014this commonplace, quiet stranger\u2014how had he become\r\ninvolved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him? What made him\r\nseek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been\r\nasleep in bed? I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below\u2014what\r\nbrought him here! And why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery\r\ndone him? Why did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester\r\nenforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had\r\nbeen outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted\r\nagainst; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!\r\nLastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous\r\nwill of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few\r\nwords which had passed between them assured me of this. It was evident that in\r\ntheir former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been\r\nhabitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen\r\nMr. Rochester\u2019s dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason\u2019s arrival? Why had the mere\r\nname of this unresisting individual\u2014whom his word now sufficed to control like\r\na child\u2014fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on an\r\noak?\r\n\n\r\nOh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered: \u201cJane, I\r\nhave got a blow\u2014I have got a blow, Jane.\u201d I could not forget how the arm had\r\ntrembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no light matter which could\r\nthus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax\r\nRochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen will he come? When will he come?\u201d I cried inwardly, as the night lingered\r\nand lingered\u2014as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day\r\nnor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason\u2019s white lips;\r\nagain and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed\r\nineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three\r\ncombined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak,\r\nwild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.\r\n\n\r\nThe candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of\r\ngrey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. Presently I\r\nheard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope\r\nrevived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the\r\nyielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more\r\nthan two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Carter, be on the alert,\u201d he said to this last: \u201cI give you but\r\nhalf-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the\r\npatient downstairs and all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut is he fit to move, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must be kept\r\nup. Come, set to work.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in\r\nall the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn\r\nwas advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east. Then he\r\napproached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, my good fellow, how are you?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s done for me, I fear,\u201d was the faint reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a whit!\u2014courage! This day fortnight you\u2019ll hardly be a pin the worse of\r\nit: you\u2019ve lost a little blood; that\u2019s all. Carter, assure him there\u2019s no\r\ndanger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can do that conscientiously,\u201d said Carter, who had now undone the bandages;\r\n\u201conly I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have bled so much\u2014but\r\nhow is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut. This wound was\r\nnot done with a knife: there have been teeth here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe bit me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe worried me like a tigress, when Rochester got\r\nthe knife from her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,\u201d said\r\nMr. Rochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut under such circumstances, what could one do?\u201d returned Mason. \u201cOh, it was\r\nfrightful!\u201d he added, shuddering. \u201cAnd I did not expect it: she looked so quiet\r\nat first.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI warned you,\u201d was his friend\u2019s answer; \u201cI said\u2014be on your guard when you go\r\nnear her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had me with you:\r\nit was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought I could have done some good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\r\nhowever, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my\r\nadvice; so I\u2019ll say no more. Carter\u2014hurry!\u2014hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I\r\nmust have him off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDirectly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this other wound\r\nin the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe sucked the blood: she said she\u2019d drain my heart,\u201d said Mason.\r\n\n\r\nI saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror,\r\nhatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don\u2019t repeat it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could forget it,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town,\r\nyou may think of her as dead and buried\u2014or rather, you need not think of her at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cImpossible to forget this night!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as dead as a\r\nherring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now. There!\u2014Carter\r\nhas done with you or nearly so; I\u2019ll make you decent in a trice. Jane\u201d (he\r\nturned to me for the first time since his re-entrance), \u201ctake this key: go down\r\ninto my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top\r\ndrawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring\r\nthem here; and be nimble.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and\r\nreturned with them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cgo to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but\r\ndon\u2019t leave the room: you may be wanted again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI retired as directed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?\u201d inquired Mr. Rochester\r\npresently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; all was very still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your sake,\r\nand for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven long to avoid\r\nexposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here, Carter, help him on\r\nwith his waist-coat. Where did you leave your furred cloak? You can\u2019t travel a\r\nmile without that, I know, in this damned cold climate. In your room?\u2014Jane, run\r\ndown to Mr. Mason\u2019s room,\u2014the one next mine,\u2014and fetch a cloak you will see\r\nthere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with\r\nfur.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ve another errand for you,\u201d said my untiring master; \u201cyou must away to\r\nmy room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!\u2014a clod-hopping\r\nmessenger would never do at this juncture. You must open the middle drawer of\r\nmy toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass you will find\r\nthere,\u2014quick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose\r\nmyself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian\r\ncharlatan\u2014a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used\r\nindiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance. Jane, a\r\nlittle water.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on the\r\nwashstand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do;\u2014now wet the lip of the phial.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to\r\nMason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDrink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut will it hurt me?\u2014is it inflammatory?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDrink! drink! drink!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was dressed\r\nnow: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied. Mr. Rochester\r\nlet him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the liquid; he then took his\r\narm\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow I am sure you can get on your feet,\u201d he said\u2014\u201ctry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe patient rose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCarter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard; step\r\nout\u2014that\u2019s it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do feel better,\u201d remarked Mr. Mason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt\r\nthe side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in\r\nthe yard\u2014or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over\r\nthe pavement\u2014to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come\r\nto the foot of the stairs and hem.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of rising; but\r\nI found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage door was fastened;\r\nI opened it with as little noise as possible: all the yard was quiet; but the\r\ngates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, with horses ready\r\nharnessed, and driver seated on the box, stationed outside. I approached him,\r\nand said the gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round\r\nand listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains\r\nwere yet drawn over the servants\u2019 chamber windows; little birds were just\r\ntwittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like\r\nwhite garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage\r\nhorses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.\r\n\n\r\nThe gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon,\r\nseemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the chaise; Carter\r\nfollowed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake care of him,\u201d said Mr. Rochester to the latter, \u201cand keep him at your\r\nhouse till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he\r\ngets on. Richard, how is it with you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe fresh air revives me, Fairfax.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind\u2014good-bye, Dick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFairfax\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell what is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her\u2014\u201d\r\nhe stopped and burst into tears.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do my best; and have done it, and will do it,\u201d was the answer: he shut up\r\nthe chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet would to God there was an end of all this!\u201d added Mr. Rochester, as he\r\nclosed and barred the heavy yard-gates.\r\n\n\r\nThis done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the\r\nwall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to\r\nreturn to the house; again, however, I heard him call \u201cJane!\u201d He had opened the\r\nportal and stood at it, waiting for me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome where there is some freshness, for a few moments,\u201d he said; \u201cthat house\r\nis a mere dungeon: don\u2019t you feel it so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,\u201d he answered; \u201cand you see it\r\nthrough a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the\r\nsilk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods\r\nmere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now here\u201d (he pointed to the leafy\r\nenclosure we had entered) \u201call is real, sweet, and pure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry\r\ntrees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned\r\nflowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood,\r\nsweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of\r\nApril showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them:\r\nthe sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the\r\nwreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, will you have a flower?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light clouds which\r\nare sure to melt away as the day waxes warm\u2014this placid and balmly atmosphere?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do, very much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have passed a strange night, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd it has made you look pale\u2014were you afraid when I left you alone with\r\nMason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I had fastened the door\u2014I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a\r\ncareless shepherd if I had left a lamb\u2014my pet lamb\u2014so near a wolf\u2019s den,\r\nunguarded: you were safe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill Grace Poole live here still, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh yes! don\u2019t trouble your head about her\u2014put the thing out of your thoughts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever fear\u2014I will take care of myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then. To live,\r\nfor me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is evidently potent\r\nwith him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me\u2014but,\r\nunintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not\r\nof life, yet for ever of happiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to\r\navert the danger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated in a\r\nmoment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him \u2018Do that,\u2019\r\nand the thing has been done. But I cannot give him orders in this case: I\r\ncannot say \u2018Beware of harming me, Richard;\u2019 for it is imperative that I should\r\nkeep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will\r\npuzzle you further. You are my little friend, are you not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your\r\neye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me\u2014working for me, and with\r\nme, in, as you characteristically say, \u2018all that is right:\u2019 for if I bid\r\nyou do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no\r\nneat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would\r\nthen turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, \u2018No, sir; that is impossible: I\r\ncannot do it, because it is wrong;\u2019 and would become immutable as a fixed star.\r\nWell, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you\r\nwhere I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should\r\ntransfix me at once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are\r\nvery safe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic seat.\r\nMr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit,\u201d he said; \u201cthe bench is long enough for two. You don\u2019t hesitate to take a\r\nplace at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew\u2014while all the flowers in\r\nthis old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones\u2019\r\nbreakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of\r\nwork\u2014I\u2019ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but\r\nfirst, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in\r\ndetaining you, or that you err in staying.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; I am content.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:\u2014suppose you were no longer a girl\r\nwell reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards;\r\nimagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a\r\ncapital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose\r\nconsequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I\r\ndon\u2019t say a crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other\r\nguilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is\r\nerror. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly\r\ninsupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but\r\nneither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted\r\nyou on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which\r\nyou feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base\r\nassociations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and\r\nthere, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure\u2014I mean in heartless,\r\nsensual pleasure\u2014such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and\r\nsoul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a\r\nnew acquaintance\u2014how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the\r\ngood and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never\r\nbefore encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without\r\ntaint. Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back\u2014higher\r\nwishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what\r\nremains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain\r\nthis end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom\u2014a mere\r\nconventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your\r\njudgment approves?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to\r\nsuggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! The west wind\r\nwhispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a\r\nmedium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however\r\nsweet, was inarticulate.\r\n\n\r\nAgain Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified\r\nin daring the world\u2019s opinion, in order to attach to him for ever this gentle,\r\ngracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and\r\nregeneration of life?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d I answered, \u201ca wanderer\u2019s repose or a sinner\u2019s reformation should never\r\ndepend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die; philosophers falter in wisdom,\r\nand Christians in goodness: if any one you know has suffered and erred, let him\r\nlook higher than his equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the instrument\u2014the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the\r\ninstrument. I have myself\u2014I tell it you without parable\u2014been a worldly,\r\ndissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure\r\nin\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I almost\r\nwondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended\r\nrevelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes\u2014so long was the\r\nsilence protracted. At last I looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking\r\neagerly at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle friend,\u201d said he, in quite a changed tone\u2014while his face changed too,\r\nlosing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and sarcastic\u2014\u201cyou have\r\nnoticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don\u2019t you think if I married her\r\nshe would regenerate me with a vengeance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came\r\nback he was humming a tune.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, Jane,\u201d said he, stopping before me, \u201cyou are quite pale with your\r\nvigils: don\u2019t you curse me for disturbing your rest?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCurse you? No, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were warmer\r\nlast night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber. Jane,\r\nwhen will you watch with me again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhenever I can be useful, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be able to\r\nsleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company? To you I can talk\r\nof my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a rare one, is she not, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA strapper\u2014a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such\r\nas the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there\u2019s Dent and Lynn in the\r\nstables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying\r\ncheerfully\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise: I\r\nrose at four to see him off.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"23": "\nCHAPTER XXI\n\r\nPresentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and\r\nthe three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the\r\nkey. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange\r\nones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between\r\nfar-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding\r\ntheir alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin)\r\nwhose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may\r\nbe but the sympathies of Nature with man.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven\r\nsay to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that\r\nto dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one\u2019s self or one\u2019s\r\nkin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance\r\nimmediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day\r\nBessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.\r\n\n\r\nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past\r\nweek scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a\r\ndream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on\r\nmy knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling\r\nits hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing\r\none the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever\r\nmood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven\r\nsuccessive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\r\n\n\r\nI did not like this iteration of one idea\u2014this strange recurrence of one image,\r\nand I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near.\r\nIt was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that\r\nmoonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day\r\nfollowing I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in\r\nMrs. Fairfax\u2019s room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having\r\nthe appearance of a gentleman\u2019s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and\r\nthe hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,\u201d he said, rising as I entered; \u201cbut my\r\nname is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead,\r\neight or nine years since, and I live there still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give me a\r\nride sometimes on Miss Georgiana\u2019s bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married\r\nto Bessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another little\r\none about two months since\u2014we have three now\u2014and both mother and child are\r\nthriving.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd are the family well at the house, Robert?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry I can\u2019t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at\r\npresent\u2014in great trouble.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope no one is dead,\u201d I said, glancing at his black dress. He too looked\r\ndown at the crape round his hat and replied\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. John?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how does his mother bear it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very\r\nwild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and his death\r\nwas shocking.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI heard from Bessie he was not doing well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst\r\nthe worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into jail: his mother\r\nhelped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old\r\ncompanions and habits. His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst\r\nfooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He came down to Gateshead about three\r\nweeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him. Missis refused: her means\r\nhave long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the\r\nnext news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!\u2014they say he killed\r\nhimself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMissis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout,\r\nbut was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were\r\nquite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John\u2019s death and the manner\r\nof it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without\r\nspeaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she\r\nwanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was\r\nonly yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing\r\nyour name; and at last she made out the words, \u2018Bring Jane\u2014fetch Jane Eyre: I\r\nwant to speak to her.\u2019 Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or\r\nmeans anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and\r\nadvised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their\r\nmother grew so restless, and said, \u2018Jane, Jane,\u2019 so many times, that at last\r\nthey consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I\r\nshould like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I\r\nsuppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; and I will do it now;\u201d and having directed him to the servants\u2019 hall, and\r\nrecommended him to the care of John\u2019s wife, and the attentions of John himself,\r\nI went in search of Mr. Rochester.\r\n\n\r\nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the stables, or\r\nthe grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;\u2014yes: she believed he was\r\nplaying billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click\r\nof balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram,\r\nthe two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It\r\nrequired some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however,\r\nwas one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss\r\nIngram\u2019s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes\r\nseemed to demand, \u201cWhat can the creeping creature want now?\u201d and when I said,\r\nin a low voice, \u201cMr. Rochester,\u201d she made a movement as if tempted to order me\r\naway. I remember her appearance at the moment\u2014it was very graceful and very\r\nstriking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was\r\ntwisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the game, and irritated\r\npride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes that person want you?\u201d she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester\r\nturned to see who the \u201cperson\u201d was. He made a curious grimace\u2014one of his\r\nstrange and equivocal demonstrations\u2014threw down his cue and followed me from\r\nthe room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jane?\u201d he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which\r\nhe had shut.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat to do?\u2014where to go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo see a sick lady who has sent for me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat sick lady?\u2014where does she live?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt Gateshead; in \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for people to\r\nsee her that distance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHer name is Reed, sir\u2014Mrs. Reed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cReed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his widow, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what have you to do with her? How do you know her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Reed was my uncle\u2014my mother\u2019s brother.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no\r\nrelations.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Reed left children?\u2014you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of\r\na Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on\r\ntown; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was\r\nmuch admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJohn Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and\r\nis supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked his mother that it\r\nbrought on an apoplectic attack.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a\r\nhundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach\r\nher: besides, you say she cast you off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very\r\ndifferent: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs short a time as possible, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPromise me only to stay a week\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any\r\npretext to take up a permanent residence with her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who goes with you? You don\u2019t travel a hundred miles alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, she has sent her coachman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA person to be trusted?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester meditated. \u201cWhen do you wish to go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEarly to-morrow morning, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you must have some money; you can\u2019t travel without money, and I daresay\r\nyou have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the\r\nworld, Jane?\u201d he asked, smiling.\r\n\n\r\nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. \u201cFive shillings, sir.\u201d He took the\r\npurse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its\r\nscantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: \u201cHere,\u201d said he,\r\noffering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him\r\nI had no change.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want change; you know that. Take your wages.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then, as if\r\nrecollecting something, he said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three\r\nmonths if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but now you owe me five.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I\r\nhave the opportunity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMatter of business? I am curious to hear it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be\r\nmarried?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; what then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn that case, sir, Ad\u00e8le ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive\r\nthe necessity of it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo get her out of my bride\u2019s way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too\r\nemphatically? There\u2019s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it. Ad\u00e8le, as you\r\nsay, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to\u2014the devil?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn course!\u201d he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features\r\nequally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to\r\nseek a place, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in\r\nasking favours of them\u2014but I shall advertise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!\u201d he growled. \u201cAt your peril you\r\nadvertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds.\r\nGive me back nine pounds, Jane; I\u2019ve a use for it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd so have I, sir,\u201d I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. \u201cI\r\ncould not spare the money on any account.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle niggard!\u201d said he, \u201crefusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five\r\npounds, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot five shillings, sir; nor five pence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust let me look at the cash.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; you are not to be trusted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I\u2019ll find you\r\none in time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and\r\nAd\u00e8le shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well! very well! I\u2019ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; early.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I must prepare for the journey.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I\u2019m not\r\nquite up to it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen say it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat must I say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe same, if you like, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like\r\nsomething else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for\r\ninstance; but no\u2014that would not content me either. So you\u2019ll do no more than\r\nsay Farewell, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in\r\nmany.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery likely; but it is blank and cool\u2014\u2018Farewell.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long is he going to stand with his back against that door?\u201d I asked\r\nmyself; \u201cI want to commence my packing.\u201d The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly\r\naway he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and\r\nwas off before he had risen in the morning.\r\n\n\r\nI reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the\r\nfirst of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very clean\r\nand neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the\r\nfloor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the\r\nfire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert\r\nand his sister played quietly in a corner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBless you!\u2014I knew you would come!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Bessie,\u201d said I, after I had kissed her; \u201cand I trust I am not too late.\r\nHow is Mrs. Reed?\u2014Alive still, I hope.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor\r\nsays she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally\r\nrecover.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHas she mentioned me lately?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she\r\nis sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. She\r\ngenerally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six\r\nor seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went\r\nto welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having\r\nsome tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept her\r\nhospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as\r\npassively as I used to let her undress me when a child.\r\n\n\r\nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about\u2014setting out\r\nthe tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a\r\ntea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap\r\nor push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained her\r\nquick temper as well as her light foot and good looks.\r\n\n\r\nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still,\r\nquite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, she said;\r\nand she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast,\r\nabsolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty\r\non a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.\r\n\n\r\nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person\r\nthe mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master, whether he was a\r\nnice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was rather an ugly man, but\r\nquite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I\r\nwent on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the\r\nhouse; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely\r\nof the kind she relished.\r\n\n\r\nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet,\r\n&c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also\r\naccompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I\r\nwas now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a\r\nhostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart\u2014a sense of outlawry and\r\nalmost of reprobation\u2014to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so\r\nfar away and unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my\r\nprospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a\r\nwanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and\r\nmy own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my\r\nwrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall go into the breakfast-room first,\u201d said Bessie, as she preceded me\r\nthrough the hall; \u201cthe young ladies will be there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of\r\nfurniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing\r\nat the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick\u2019s\r\nBritish Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver\u2019s\r\nTravels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were\r\nnot changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.\r\n\n\r\nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss\r\nIngram\u2014very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something\r\nascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a\r\nstraight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away\r\nfrom the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a\r\ncrucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance\r\nto her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.\r\n\n\r\nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered\u2014the\r\nslim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel,\r\nfair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and\r\nringleted yellow hair. The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was\r\nso different from her sister\u2019s\u2014so much more flowing and becoming\u2014it looked as\r\nstylish as the other\u2019s looked puritanical.\r\n\n\r\nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother\u2014and only one; the thin\r\nand pallid elder daughter had her parent\u2019s Cairngorm eye: the blooming and\r\nluxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin\u2014perhaps a little\r\nsoftened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance\r\notherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\r\n\n\r\nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the\r\nname of \u201cMiss Eyre.\u201d Eliza\u2019s greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice,\r\nwithout a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and\r\nseemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d several commonplaces\r\nabout my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone:\r\nand accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot\u2014now\r\ntraversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain\r\ntrimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting\r\nyou know that they think you a \u201cquiz\u201d without actually saying the words. A\r\ncertain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,\r\nexpress fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any\r\npositive rudeness in word or deed.\r\n\n\r\nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me\r\nit once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how\r\neasy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic\r\nattentions of the other\u2014Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The\r\nfact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months\r\nfeelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could\r\nraise\u2014pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited\r\nthan any it was in their power to inflict or bestow\u2014that their airs gave me no\r\nconcern either for good or bad.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is Mrs. Reed?\u201d I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit\r\nto bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see\r\nher to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf,\u201d said I, \u201cyou would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be\r\nmuch obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. \u201cI know\r\nshe had a particular wish to see me,\u201d I added, \u201cand I would not defer attending\r\nto her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,\u201d remarked Eliza. I soon rose,\r\nquietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step\r\nout to Bessie\u2014who was, I dared say, in the kitchen\u2014and ask her to ascertain\r\nwhether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-night. I went, and\r\nhaving found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take\r\nfurther measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from\r\narrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved\r\nto quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at\r\nonce that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred\r\nmiles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better\u2014or dead: as\r\nto her daughters\u2019 pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself\r\nindependent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room,\r\ntold her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk\r\nconveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the\r\nlanding.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMissis is awake,\u201d said she; \u201cI have told her you are here: come and let us see\r\nif she will know you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often\r\nbeen summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before\r\nBessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was\r\nnow getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of\r\nold; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a\r\nhundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me\r\nuncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the\r\nslim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap\r\nout imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the\r\nbed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.\r\n\n\r\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed\u2019s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image.\r\nIt is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the\r\npromptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate,\r\nand I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her\r\ngreat sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries\u2014to\r\nbe reconciled and clasp hands in amity.\r\n\n\r\nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever\u2014there was that\r\npeculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious,\r\ndespotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the\r\nrecollection of childhood\u2019s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh\r\nline now! And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs this Jane Eyre?\u201d she said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to\r\nforget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay\r\noutside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have\r\nexperienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon\r\nsoftened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her\r\nhand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night\r\nwas warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of\r\nme\u2014her feeling towards me\u2014was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony\r\neye\u2014opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears\u2014that she was resolved to\r\nconsider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no\r\ngenerous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\r\n\n\r\nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue\r\nher\u2014to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had\r\nrisen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. I brought a\r\nchair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou sent for me,\u201d I said, \u201cand I am here; and it is my intention to stay till\r\nI see how you get on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, of course! You have seen my daughters?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over\r\nwith you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in\r\nrecalling them. But there was something I wished to say\u2014let me see\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her\r\nonce vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my\r\nelbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once\r\nirritated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit up!\u201d said she; \u201cdon\u2019t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane\r\nEyre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am Jane Eyre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a\r\nburden to be left on my hands\u2014and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and\r\nhourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper,\r\nand her continual, unnatural watchings of one\u2019s movements! I declare she talked\r\nto me once like something mad, or like a fiend\u2014no child ever spoke or looked as\r\nshe did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did they do with her\r\nat Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She,\r\nhowever, did not die: but I said she did\u2014I wish she had died!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband\u2019s only sister,\r\nand a great favourite with him: he opposed the family\u2019s disowning her when she\r\nmade her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a\r\nsimpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it\r\nout to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my\r\neyes on it\u2014a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all\r\nnight long\u2014not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and\r\nmoaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had\r\nbeen his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would\r\ntry to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not\r\nbear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike. In his last\r\nillness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before\r\nhe died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been\r\ncharged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.\r\nJohn does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me\r\nand like my brothers\u2014he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting\r\nme with letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting\r\npoor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let\r\nit off. I can never submit to do that\u2014yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of\r\nmy income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John gambles dreadfully,\r\nand always loses\u2014poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and\r\ndegraded\u2014his look is frightful\u2014I feel ashamed for him when I see him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe was getting much excited. \u201cI think I had better leave her now,\u201d said I to\r\nBessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night\u2014in the\r\nmorning she is calmer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rose. \u201cStop!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Reed, \u201cthere is another thing I wished to say.\r\nHe threatens me\u2014he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I\r\ndream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or\r\nwith a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy\r\ntroubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she\r\nsucceeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank\r\ninto a dozing state. I then left her.\r\n\n\r\nMore than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her. She\r\ncontinued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything\r\nwhich could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with\r\nGeorgiana and Eliza. They were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit\r\nhalf the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to\r\nme or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the\r\nhour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for\r\noccupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they\r\nserved me for both.\r\n\n\r\nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a\r\nseat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy\r\nvignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in\r\nthe ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two\r\nrocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and\r\nwater-flags, and a naiad\u2019s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of\r\nthem; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow\u2019s nest, under a wreath of\r\nhawthorn-bloom.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did\r\nnot care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked\r\naway. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a\r\nsquare lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers\r\nproceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal\r\neyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a\r\nwell-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a\r\nflexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided\r\ncleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and\r\nsome jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for\r\nthe eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful\r\nworking. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and\r\nsombre; the irids lustrous and large. \u201cGood! but not quite the thing,\u201d I\r\nthought, as I surveyed the effect: \u201cthey want more force and spirit;\u201d and I\r\nwrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly\u2014a\r\nhappy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend\u2019s face under my gaze;\r\nand what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me? I\r\nlooked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that a portrait of some one you know?\u201d asked Eliza, who had approached me\r\nunnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath\r\nthe other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful\r\nrepresentation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any one but\r\nmyself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much,\r\nbut she called that \u201can ugly man.\u201d They both seemed surprised at my skill. I\r\noffered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.\r\nThen Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour\r\ndrawing: this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the\r\ngrounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential\r\nconversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter\r\nshe had spent in London two seasons ago\u2014of the admiration she had there\r\nexcited\u2014the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled\r\nconquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints\r\nwere enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental\r\nscenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was\r\nthat day improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from\r\nday to day: they always ran on the same theme\u2014herself, her loves, and woes. It\r\nwas strange she never once adverted either to her mother\u2019s illness, or her\r\nbrother\u2019s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind\r\nseemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after\r\ndissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother\u2019s\r\nsick-room, and no more.\r\n\n\r\nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a\r\nbusier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did:\r\nor rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an alarm to call\r\nher up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after\r\nthat meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its\r\nallotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on\r\ninspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great\r\nattraction of that volume, and she said, \u201cthe Rubric.\u201d Three hours she gave to\r\nstitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large\r\nenough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article,\r\nshe informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected\r\nnear Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself\r\nin the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She seemed to\r\nwant no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this\r\nroutine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of\r\nany incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\r\n\n\r\nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual,\r\nthat John\u2019s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source\r\nof profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and\r\nformed her resolution. Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when\r\nher mother died\u2014and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she\r\nshould either recover or linger long\u2014she would execute a long-cherished\r\nproject: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured\r\nfrom disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\r\nworld. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had.\r\nShe would not be burdened with her society for any consideration. Georgiana\r\nshould take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in\r\nlying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over\r\nand over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town.\r\n\u201cIt would be so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cif she could only get out of the way\r\nfor a month or two, till all was over.\u201d I did not ask what she meant by \u201call\r\nbeing over,\u201d but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother\r\nand the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of\r\nher sister\u2019s indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging\r\nobject had been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book\r\nand unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGeorgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed\r\nto cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life.\r\nInstead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you\r\nseek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person\u2019s strength: if no one\r\ncan be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy,\r\nuseless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.\r\nThen, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and\r\nexcitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be\r\ncourted, you must be flattered\u2014you must have music, dancing, and society\u2014or you\r\nlanguish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make\r\nyou independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day;\r\nshare it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray\r\nunemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes\u2014include all; do each\r\npiece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will\r\nclose almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one\r\nfor helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one\u2019s\r\ncompany, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an\r\nindependent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall\r\noffer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect\r\nit\u2014go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling\u2014and suffer the results of\r\nyour idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this plainly;\r\nand listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I\r\nshall steadily act on it. After my mother\u2019s death, I wash my hands of you: from\r\nthe day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will\r\nbe as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that\r\nbecause we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten\r\nme down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this\u2014if the whole human\r\nrace, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth,\r\nI would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe closed her lips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,\u201d\r\nanswered Georgiana. \u201cEverybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless\r\ncreature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I\r\nhave had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin\r\nVere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be\r\nreceived into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the\r\nspy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.\u201d Georgiana took out her\r\nhandkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold,\r\nimpassable, and assiduously industrious.\r\n\n\r\nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two\r\nnatures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless\r\nfor the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but\r\njudgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human\r\ndeglutition.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over\r\nthe perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint\u2019s-day service at the\r\nnew church\u2014for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather\r\never prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional\r\nduties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on\r\nweek-days as there were prayers.\r\n\n\r\nI bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay\r\nthere almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent attention:\r\nthe hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever\r\nshe could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could\r\nonly come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had\r\nexpected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic;\r\nher livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed\r\nthe fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now\r\ngaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.\r\n\n\r\nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: \u201cOne\r\nlies there,\u201d I thought, \u201cwho will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements.\r\nWhither will that spirit\u2014now struggling to quit its material tenement\u2014flit when\r\nat length released?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying\r\nwords\u2014her faith\u2014her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still\r\nlistening in thought to her well-remembered tones\u2014still picturing her pale and\r\nspiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid\r\ndeathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father\u2019s\r\nbosom\u2014when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: \u201cWho is that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up to her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is I, Aunt Reed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2014I?\u201d was her answer. \u201cWho are you?\u201d looking at me with surprise and a sort\r\nof alarm, but still not wildly. \u201cYou are quite a stranger to me\u2014where is\r\nBessie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is at the lodge, aunt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAunt,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWho calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and\r\nyet I know you\u2014that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me:\r\nyou are like\u2014why, you are like Jane Eyre!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my\r\nidentity.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d said she, \u201cI am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished\r\nto see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight\r\nyears she must be so changed.\u201d I now gently assured her that I was the person\r\nshe supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that\r\nher senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to\r\nfetch me from Thornfield.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am very ill, I know,\u201d she said ere long. \u201cI was trying to turn myself a few\r\nminutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my\r\nmind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an\r\nhour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room\r\nbut you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI assured her we were alone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking\r\nthe promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the\r\nother\u2014\u201d she stopped. \u201cAfter all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,\u201d she\r\nmurmured to herself: \u201cand then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her\r\nis painful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she\r\nseemed to experience some inward sensation\u2014the precursor, perhaps, of the last\r\npang.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.\u2014Go to\r\nmy dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI obeyed her directions. \u201cRead the letter,\u201d she said.\r\n\n\r\nIt was short, and thus conceived:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMADAM,\u2014\r\n\u201cWill you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and\r\nto tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to\r\ncome to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a\r\ncompetency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my\r\nlife, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.\r\n\n\r\nI am, Madam, &c., &c.,\r\n\u201cJOHN EYRE, Madeira.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was dated three years back.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did I never hear of this?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in\r\nlifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane\u2014the fury\r\nwith which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred\r\nme the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which\r\nyou affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had\r\ntreated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when\r\nyou thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an\r\nanimal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and\r\ncursed me in a man\u2019s voice.\u2014Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDear Mrs. Reed,\u201d said I, as I offered her the draught she required, \u201cthink no\r\nmore of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate\r\nlanguage: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn\r\nbreath, she went on thus\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted\r\nby your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not\r\nendure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane\r\nEyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please:\r\nwrite and contradict my assertion\u2014expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You\r\nwere born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the\r\nrecollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to\r\ncommit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me\r\nwith kindness and forgiveness\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have a very bad disposition,\u201d said she, \u201cand one to this day I feel it\r\nimpossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent\r\nunder any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can\r\nnever comprehend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not\r\nvindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you\r\nif you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now:\r\nkiss me, aunt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I oppressed\r\nher by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid her down\u2014for I\r\nraised her and supported her on my arm while she drank\u2014I covered her ice-cold\r\nand clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch\u2014the glazing\r\neyes shunned my gaze.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLove me, then, or hate me, as you will,\u201d I said at last, \u201cyou have my full and\r\nfree forgiveness: ask now for God\u2019s, and be at peace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change\r\nher habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me\u2014dying, she must hate\r\nme still.\r\n\n\r\nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer,\r\nhoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was fast relapsing\r\ninto stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o\u2019clock that night she\r\ndied. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters.\r\nThey came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time\r\nlaid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into\r\nloud weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed\u2019s once\r\nrobust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its\r\ncold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable\r\nsoul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with\r\ngloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or\r\nsubduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her woes\u2014not\r\nmy loss\u2014and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such\r\na form.\r\n\n\r\nEliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she observed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was\r\nshortened by trouble.\u201d And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant:\r\nas it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had\r\ndropt a tear.\r\n\n"}
{"24": "\nCHAPTER XXII\n\r\nMr. Rochester had given me but one week\u2019s leave of absence: yet a month elapsed\r\nbefore I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after the funeral,\r\nbut Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London, whither\r\nshe was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to\r\ndirect his sister\u2019s interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she\r\ndreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her\r\ndejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with\r\nher feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did\r\nmy best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that while I\r\nworked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, \u201cIf you and I were destined to\r\nlive always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.\r\nI should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should\r\nassign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it\r\nshould be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those\r\ndrawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only\r\nbecause our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly\r\nmournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on\r\nmy part.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza\u2019s turn to request me to stay\r\nanother week. Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was\r\nabout to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own\r\nroom, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers,\r\nand holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the\r\nhouse, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning she told me I was at liberty. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cI am obliged to\r\nyou for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There is some difference\r\nbetween living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own\r\npart in life and burden no one. To-morrow,\u201d she continued, \u201cI set out for the\r\nContinent. I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle\u2014a nunnery\r\nyou would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself\r\nfor a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful\r\nstudy of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it\r\nis, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in\r\norder, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her\r\nfrom it. \u201cThe vocation will fit you to a hair,\u201d I thought: \u201cmuch good may it do\r\nyou!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen we parted, she said: \u201cGood-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you\r\nhave some sense.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI then returned: \u201cYou are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I\r\nsuppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent. However,\r\nit is not my business, and so it suits you, I don\u2019t much care.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are in the right,\u201d said she; and with these words we each went our\r\nseparate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister\r\nagain, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match\r\nwith a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil,\r\nand is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her\r\nnovitiate, and which she endowed with her fortune.\r\n\n\r\nHow people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I\r\ndid not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had known what it was to\r\ncome back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for\r\nlooking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to\r\nLowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get\r\neither. Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet\r\ndrew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I\r\ncame. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.\r\n\n\r\nMy journey seemed tedious\u2014very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at\r\nan inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve hours I thought of\r\nMrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and discoloured face, and\r\nheard her strangely altered voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the\r\nhearse, the black train of tenants and servants\u2014few was the number of\r\nrelatives\u2014the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I\r\nthought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the\r\nother the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate\r\npeculiarities of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of\r\n\u2014\u2014 scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on\r\nmy traveller\u2019s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.\r\n\n\r\nI was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not long; of\r\nthat I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence:\r\nthe party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three\r\nweeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax\r\nsurmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had\r\ntalked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss\r\nIngram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what\r\nshe had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly\r\ntake place. \u201cYou would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,\u201d was my\r\nmental comment. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe question followed, \u201cWhere was I to go?\u201d I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the\r\nnight: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield\r\nagainst me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with\r\nhis arms folded\u2014smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her and me.\r\n\n\r\nI had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not\r\nwish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed to walk the\r\ndistance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the\r\nostler\u2019s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o\u2019clock of a June\r\nevening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through\r\nfields, and was now little frequented.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the\r\nhaymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from\r\ncloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue\u2014where blue was\r\nvisible\u2014was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin. The west,\r\ntoo, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it\u2014it seemed as if there was a fire lit,\r\nan altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures\r\nshone a golden redness.\r\n\n\r\nI felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask\r\nmyself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I\r\nwas going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends\r\nlooked out for me and waited my arrival. \u201cMrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm\r\nwelcome, to be sure,\u201d said I; \u201cand little Ad\u00e8le will clap her hands and jump to\r\nsee you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that\r\nhe is not thinking of you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience? These\r\naffirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on\r\nMr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added\u2014\u201cHasten! hasten!\r\nbe with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are\r\nparted from him for ever!\u201d And then I strangled a new-born agony\u2014a deformed\r\nthing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear\u2014and ran on.\r\n\n\r\nThey are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are\r\njust quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their\r\nshoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field or two to traverse,\r\nand then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. How full the hedges are of\r\nroses! But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a\r\ntall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the\r\nnarrow stile with stone steps; and I see\u2014Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book\r\nand a pencil in his hand; he is writing.\r\n\n\r\nWell, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am\r\nbeyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I should tremble in\r\nthis way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of motion in his\r\npresence. I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute\r\nfool of myself. I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew\r\ntwenty ways; for he has seen me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHillo!\u201d he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. \u201cThere you are! Come\r\non, if you please.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely\r\ncognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all,\r\nto control the working muscles of my face\u2014which I feel rebel insolently against\r\nmy will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a\r\nveil\u2014it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes\u2014just one\r\nof your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and\r\nroad like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along\r\nwith twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you\r\ndone with yourself this last month?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other\r\nworld\u2014from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me\r\nalone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I\u2019d touch you, to see if you are\r\nsubstance or shadow, you elf!\u2014but I\u2019d as soon offer to take hold of a blue\r\nignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! truant!\u201d he added, when he had\r\npaused an instant. \u201cAbsent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I\u2019ll\r\nbe sworn!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken\r\nby the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge\r\nthat I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I\r\nthought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste\r\nbut of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to\r\nfeast genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported\r\nsomething to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield\r\nas my home\u2014would that it were my home!\r\n\n\r\nHe did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I inquired soon\r\nif he had not been to London.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did she inform you what I went to do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don\u2019t think it will suit\r\nMrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won\u2019t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning\r\nback against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better\r\nadapted to match with her externally. Tell me now, fairy as you are\u2014can\u2019t you\r\ngive me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome\r\nman?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would be past the power of magic, sir;\u201d and, in thought, I added, \u201cA loving\r\neye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your\r\nsternness has a power beyond beauty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me\r\nincomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal\r\nresponse; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which\r\nhe used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think it too good for common\r\npurposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling\u2014he shed it over me now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPass, Janet,\u201d said he, making room for me to cross the stile: \u201cgo up home, and\r\nstay your weary little wandering feet at a friend\u2019s threshold.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to colloquise\r\nfurther. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him calmly. An\r\nimpulse held me fast\u2014a force turned me round. I said\u2014or something in me said\r\nfor me, and in spite of me\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get\r\nback again to you: and wherever you are is my home\u2014my only home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried.\r\nLittle Ad\u00e8le was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs. Fairfax received\r\nme with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me \u201cbon\r\nsoir\u201d with glee. This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of\r\nbeing loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an\r\naddition to their comfort.\r\n\n\r\nI that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my ears\r\nagainst the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief.\r\nWhen tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a\r\nlow seat near her, and Ad\u00e8le, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to\r\nme, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden\r\npeace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but\r\nwhen, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us,\r\nseemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable\u2014when he said he\r\nsupposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter\r\nback again, and added that he saw Ad\u00e8le was \u201cpr\u00eate \u00e0 croquer sa petite maman\r\nAnglaise\u201d\u2014I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep\r\nus together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled\r\nfrom the sunshine of his presence.\r\n\n\r\nA fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall. Nothing was\r\nsaid of the master\u2019s marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an\r\nevent. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything\r\ndecided: her answer was always in the negative. Once she said she had actually\r\nput the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride\r\nhome; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and\r\nshe could not tell what to make of him.\r\n\n\r\nOne thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings\r\nbackward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles\r\noff, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent\r\nlover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would\r\nbe but a morning\u2019s ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive:\r\nthat the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both\r\nparties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master\u2019s face to see if\r\nit were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so\r\nuniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and my pupil\r\nspent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became\r\neven gay. Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been\r\nkinder to me when there\u2014and, alas! never had I loved him so well.\r\n\n"}
{"25": "\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\r\nA splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were\r\nthen seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-girt land. It\r\nwas as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of\r\nglorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The\r\nhay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads\r\nwhite and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood,\r\nfull-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the\r\ncleared meadows between.\r\n\n\r\nOn Midsummer-eve, Ad\u00e8le, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane\r\nhalf the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop asleep, and when\r\nI left her, I sought the garden.\r\n\n\r\nIt was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:\u2014\u201cDay its fervid fires had\r\nwasted,\u201d and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit. Where the sun\r\nhad gone down in simple state\u2014pure of the pomp of clouds\u2014spread a solemn\r\npurple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on\r\none hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half\r\nheaven. The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a\r\nrising and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\n\r\nI walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent\u2014that of a\r\ncigar\u2014stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I\r\nknew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in\r\nthe grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed\r\nwith flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the\r\nother, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk\r\nfence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with\r\nlaurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a\r\nseat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such honey-dew\r\nfell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt\r\nsuch shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the\r\nupper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon\r\ncast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed\u2014not by sound, not by sight,\r\nbut once more by a warning fragrance.\r\n\n\r\nSweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding\r\ntheir evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor\r\nflower; it is\u2014I know it well\u2014it is Mr. Rochester\u2019s cigar. I look round and I\r\nlisten. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in\r\na wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but\r\nthat perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the\r\nshrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess;\r\nhe will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still\r\nhe will never see me.\r\n\n\r\nBut no\u2014eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden as\r\nattractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look\r\nat the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe\r\ncherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale\r\ntheir fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes\r\nhumming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester\u2019s foot: he sees it, and\r\nbends to examine it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, he has his back towards me,\u201d thought I, \u201cand he is occupied too; perhaps,\r\nif I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not\r\nbetray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I\r\nhad to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. \u201cI shall get by very well,\u201d I\r\nmeditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon,\r\nnot yet risen high, he said quietly, without turning\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, come and look at this fellow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had made no noise: he had not eyes behind\u2014could his shadow feel? I started at\r\nfirst, and then I approached him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook at his wings,\u201d said he, \u201che reminds me rather of a West Indian insect;\r\none does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there! he is\r\nflown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. Rochester\r\nfollowed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTurn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely\r\nno one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an\r\nanswer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always\r\nthe lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is\r\nspecially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment. I did not like to walk\r\nat this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not\r\nfind a reason to allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and\r\nthoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself\r\nlooked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any\r\nconfusion: the evil\u2014if evil existent or prospective there was\u2014seemed to lie\r\nwith me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane,\u201d he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down\r\nin the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, \u201cThornfield is a\r\npleasant place in summer, is it not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must have become in some degree attached to the house,\u2014you, who have an\r\neye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am attached to it, indeed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd though I don\u2019t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree\r\nof regard for that foolish little child Ad\u00e8le, too; and even for simple dame\r\nFairfax?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd would be sorry to part with them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPity!\u201d he said, and sighed and paused. \u201cIt is always the way of events in this\r\nlife,\u201d he continued presently: \u201cno sooner have you got settled in a pleasant\r\nresting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour\r\nof repose is expired.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust I move on, sir?\u201d I asked. \u201cMust I leave Thornfield?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is come now\u2014I must give it to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are going to be married, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEx-act-ly\u2014pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail\r\nstraight on the head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoon, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery soon, my\u2014that is, Miss Eyre: and you\u2019ll remember, Jane, the first time I,\r\nor Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old\r\nbachelor\u2019s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of\r\nmatrimony\u2014to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she\u2019s an extensive armful:\r\nbut that\u2019s not to the point\u2014one can\u2019t have too much of such a very excellent\r\nthing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying\u2014listen to me, Jane!\r\nYou\u2019re not turning your head to look after more moths, are you? That was only a\r\nlady-clock, child, \u2018flying away home.\u2019 I wish to remind you that it was you who\r\nfirst said to me, with that discretion I respect in you\u2014with that foresight,\r\nprudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position\u2014that\r\nin case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Ad\u00e8le had better trot\r\nforthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the\r\ncharacter of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I\u2019ll try to\r\nforget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my\r\nlaw of action. Ad\u00e8le must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new\r\nsituation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose\u2014\u201d I was going\r\nto say, \u201cI suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake\r\nmyself to:\u201d but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for\r\nmy voice was not quite under command.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,\u201d continued Mr. Rochester; \u201cand in\r\nthe interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir; I am sorry to give\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her duty as\r\nwell as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any\r\nlittle assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already,\r\nthrough my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is\r\nto undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O\u2019Gall of\r\nBitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. You\u2019ll like Ireland, I think: they\u2019re\r\nsuch warm-hearted people there, they say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a long way off, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo matter\u2014a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFrom what, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFrom England and from Thornfield: and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFrom you, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my\r\ntears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing.\r\nThe thought of Mrs. O\u2019Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and\r\ncolder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush\r\nbetween me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the\r\nremembrance of the wider ocean\u2014wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and\r\nwhat I naturally and inevitably loved.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a long way,\u201d I again said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I\r\nshall never see you again, Jane: that\u2019s morally certain. I never go over to\r\nIreland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country. We have been good\r\nfriends, Jane; have we not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little\r\ntime that remains to them close to each other. Come! we\u2019ll talk over the voyage\r\nand the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their\r\nshining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench\r\nat its old roots. Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should\r\nnever more be destined to sit there together.\u201d He seated me and himself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on\r\nsuch weary travels: but if I can\u2019t do better, how is it to be helped? Are you\r\nanything akin to me, do you think, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201cI sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to\r\nyou\u2014especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string\r\nsomewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar\r\nstring situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that\r\nboisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us,\r\nI am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I\u2019ve a nervous\r\nnotion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,\u2014you\u2019d forget me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I never should, sir: you know\u2014\u201d Impossible to proceed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no\r\nlonger; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute\r\ndistress. When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had\r\nnever been born, or never come to Thornfield.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are sorry to leave it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was claiming\r\nmastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to\r\novercome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,\u2014and to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:\u2014I love it, because I have\r\nlived in it a full and delightful life,\u2014momentarily at least. I have not been\r\ntrampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior\r\nminds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and\r\nenergetic and high. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with\r\nwhat I delight in,\u2014with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known\r\nyou, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I\r\nabsolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure;\r\nand it is like looking on the necessity of death.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you see the necessity?\u201d he asked suddenly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere? You, sir, have placed it before me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn what shape?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,\u2014your bride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy bride! What bride? I have no bride!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will have.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes;\u2014I will!\u2014I will!\u201d He set his teeth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I must go:\u2014you have said it yourself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: you must stay! I swear it\u2014and the oath shall be kept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I must go!\u201d I retorted, roused to something like passion. \u201cDo you\r\nthink I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?\u2014a\r\nmachine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from\r\nmy lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because\r\nI am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think\r\nwrong!\u2014I have as much soul as you,\u2014and full as much heart! And if God had\r\ngifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for\r\nyou to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now\r\nthrough the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;\u2014it\r\nis my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the\r\ngrave, and we stood at God\u2019s feet, equal,\u2014as we are!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs we are!\u201d repeated Mr. Rochester\u2014\u201cso,\u201d he added, enclosing me in his arms,\r\ngathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: \u201cso, Jane!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, so, sir,\u201d I rejoined: \u201cand yet not so; for you are a married man\u2014or as\r\ngood as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you\u2014to one with whom you have\r\nno sympathy\u2014whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you\r\nsneer at her. I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you\u2014let me\r\ngo!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere, Jane? To Ireland?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, be still; don\u2019t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending\r\nits own plumage in its desperation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an\r\nindependent will, which I now exert to leave you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnother effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your will shall decide your destiny,\u201d he said: \u201cI offer you my hand, my\r\nheart, and a share of all my possessions.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou play a farce, which I merely laugh at.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI ask you to pass through life at my side\u2014to be my second self, and best\r\nearthly companion.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the\r\nboughs of the chestnut: it wandered away\u2014away\u2014to an indefinite distance\u2014it\r\ndied. The nightingale\u2019s song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening\r\nto it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and\r\nseriously. Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was silent: I thought he mocked me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Jane\u2014come hither.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour bride stands between us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe rose, and with a stride reached me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy bride is here,\u201d he said, again drawing me to him, \u201cbecause my equal is\r\nhere, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I was\r\nstill incredulous.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you doubt me, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have no faith in me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a whit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I a liar in your eyes?\u201d he asked passionately. \u201cLittle sceptic, you\r\nshall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that you\r\nknow. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused\r\na rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and\r\nafter that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her\r\nand her mother. I would not\u2014I could not\u2014marry Miss Ingram. You\u2014you strange, you\r\nalmost unearthly thing!\u2014I love as my own flesh. You\u2014poor and obscure, and small\r\nand plain as you are\u2014I entreat to accept me as a husband.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat, me!\u201d I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness\u2014and especially in his\r\nincivility\u2014to credit his sincerity: \u201cme who have not a friend in the world but\r\nyou\u2014if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have given me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, Jane, I must have you for my own\u2014entirely my own. Will you be mine? Say\r\nyes, quickly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I want to read your countenance\u2014turn!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page.\r\nRead on: only make haste, for I suffer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong\r\nworkings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jane, you torture me!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWith that searching and yet faithful\r\nand generous look, you torture me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to\r\nyou must be gratitude and devotion\u2014they cannot torture.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGratitude!\u201d he ejaculated; and added wildly\u2014\u201cJane accept me quickly. Say,\r\nEdward\u2014give me my name\u2014Edward\u2014I will marry you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to be your\r\nwife?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, sir, I will marry you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEdward\u2014my little wife!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDear Edward!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome to me\u2014come to me entirely now,\u201d said he; and added, in his deepest tone,\r\nspeaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, \u201cMake my happiness\u2014I will\r\nmake yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod pardon me!\u201d he subjoined ere long; \u201cand man meddle not with me: I have\r\nher, and will hold her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014that is the best of it,\u201d he said. And if I had loved him less I should have\r\nthought his accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by him, roused\r\nfrom the nightmare of parting\u2014called to the paradise of union\u2014I thought only of\r\nthe bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow. Again and again he said,\r\n\u201cAre you happy, Jane?\u201d And again and again I answered, \u201cYes.\u201d After which he\r\nmurmured, \u201cIt will atone\u2014it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and\r\ncold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there\r\nnot love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at God\u2019s\r\ntribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world\u2019s judgment\u2014I wash\r\nmy hands thereof. For man\u2019s opinion\u2014I defy it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in\r\nshadow: I could scarcely see my master\u2019s face, near as I was. And what ailed\r\nthe chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel\r\nwalk, and came sweeping over us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe must go in,\u201d said Mr. Rochester: \u201cthe weather changes. I could have sat\r\nwith thee till morning, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d thought I, \u201ccould I with you.\u201d I should have said so, perhaps, but a\r\nlivid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and there was a\r\ncrack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only of hiding my\r\ndazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester\u2019s shoulder.\r\n\n\r\nThe rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds, and into\r\nthe house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold. He was\r\ntaking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my loosened hair,\r\nwhen Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room. I did not observe her at first, nor\r\ndid Mr. Rochester. The lamp was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHasten to take off your wet things,\u201d said he; \u201cand before you go,\r\ngood-night\u2014good-night, my darling!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the\r\nwidow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs.\r\n\u201cExplanation will do for another time,\u201d thought I. Still, when I reached my\r\nchamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what\r\nshe had seen. But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind\r\nblew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the\r\nlightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours\u2019\r\nduration, I experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my\r\ndoor in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was\r\ncomfort, that was strength for anything.\r\n\n\r\nBefore I left my bed in the morning, little Ad\u00e8le came running in to tell me\r\nthat the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by\r\nlightning in the night, and half of it split away.\r\n\n"}
{"26": "\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\r\nAs I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it\r\nwere a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr.\r\nRochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.\r\n\n\r\nWhile arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no\r\nlonger plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes\r\nseemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the\r\nlustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I\r\nfeared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face\r\nto his now, and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but\r\nclean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire\r\nhad ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.\r\n\n\r\nI was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant\r\nJune morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through\r\nthe open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must\r\nbe gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy\u2014pale, ragged\r\nobjects both\u2014were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the\r\nmoney I happened to have in my purse\u2014some three or four shillings: good or bad,\r\nthey must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but\r\nnothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad countenance,\r\nand saying gravely\u2014\u201cMiss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?\u201d During the meal she\r\nwas quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her then. I must wait for my\r\nmaster to give explanations; and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I\r\nhastened upstairs. I met Ad\u00e8le leaving the schoolroom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going? It is time for lessons.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn there,\u201d pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and there he\r\nstood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome and bid me good-morning,\u201d said he. I gladly advanced; and it was not\r\nmerely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an\r\nembrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so\r\ncaressed by him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,\u201d said he: \u201ctruly pretty this\r\nmorning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my mustard-seed? This little\r\nsunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel\r\nhair, and the radiant hazel eyes?\u201d (I had green eyes, reader; but you must\r\nexcuse the mistake: for him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is Jane Eyre, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoon to be Jane Rochester,\u201d he added: \u201cin four weeks, Janet; not a day more.\r\nDo you hear that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The feeling, the\r\nannouncement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with\r\njoy\u2014something that smote and stunned: it was, I think, almost fear.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you gave me a new name\u2014Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mrs. Rochester,\u201d said he; \u201cyoung Mrs. Rochester\u2014Fairfax Rochester\u2019s\r\ngirl-bride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never enjoy\r\ncomplete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different destiny to the\r\nrest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is a fairy tale\u2014a\r\nday-dream.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This morning I wrote to my\r\nbanker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his keeping,\u2014heirlooms for\r\nthe ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap:\r\nfor every privilege, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a\r\npeer\u2019s daughter, if about to marry her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, sir!\u2014never rain jewels! I don\u2019t like to hear them spoken of. Jewels for\r\nJane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on your\r\nforehead,\u2014which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped her patent of\r\nnobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine\r\nwrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in\r\nanother strain. Don\u2019t address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,\r\nQuakerish governess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my\r\nheart,\u2014delicate and a\u00ebrial.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPuny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,\u2014or you are sneering.\r\nFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t be ironical!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,\u201d he went on, while I\r\nreally became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he was either\r\ndeluding himself or trying to delude me. \u201cI will attire my Jane in satin and\r\nlace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will cover the head I love\r\nbest with a priceless veil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd then you won\u2019t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer,\r\nbut an ape in a harlequin\u2019s jacket\u2014a jay in borrowed plumes. I would as soon\r\nsee you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a\r\ncourt-lady\u2019s robe; and I don\u2019t call you handsome, sir, though I love you most\r\ndearly: far too dearly to flatter you. Don\u2019t flatter me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. \u201cThis very day\r\nI shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses\r\nfor yourself. I told you we shall be married in four weeks. The wedding is to\r\ntake place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you\r\naway at once to town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to\r\nregions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall\r\nsee whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too,\r\nof the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison\r\nwith others.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I travel?\u2014and with you, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna:\r\nall the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you: wherever I\r\nstamped my hoof, your sylph\u2019s foot shall step also. Ten years since, I flew\r\nthrough Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I\r\nshall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed at him as he said this. \u201cI am not an angel,\u201d I asserted; \u201cand I will\r\nnot be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect\r\nnor exact anything celestial of me\u2014for you will not get it, any more than I\r\nshall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you anticipate of me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,\u2014a very little while;\r\nand then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will\r\nbe stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when you get well used\r\nto me, you will perhaps like me again,\u2014like me, I say, not love\r\nme. I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed\r\nin books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a\r\nhusband\u2019s ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope\r\nnever to become quite distasteful to my dear master.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDistasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and yet\r\nagain: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but love\r\nyou\u2014with truth, fervour, constancy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet are you not capricious, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find\r\nout they have neither souls nor hearts\u2014when they open to me a perspective of\r\nflatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but\r\nto the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the\r\ncharacter that bends but does not break\u2014at once supple and stable, tractable\r\nand consistent\u2014I am ever tender and true.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love such an\r\none?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI love it now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult\r\nstandard?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me\u2014you seem to\r\nsubmit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the\r\nsoft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart. I\r\nam influenced\u2014conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and\r\nthe conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you\r\nsmile, Jane? What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance\r\nmean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I was\r\nthinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou were, you little elfish\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush, sir! You don\u2019t talk very wisely just now; any more than those gentlemen\r\nacted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would no doubt by their\r\nseverity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors; and so will\r\nyou, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a\r\nfavour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAsk me something now, Janet,\u2014the least thing: I desire to be entreated\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall swear\r\nconcession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, sir; I ask only this: don\u2019t send for the jewels, and don\u2019t crown\r\nme with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain\r\npocket handkerchief you have there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI might as well \u2018gild refined gold.\u2019 I know it: your request is granted\r\nthen\u2014for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my banker. But you\r\nhave not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much\r\npiqued on one point.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked disturbed. \u201cWhat? what?\u201d he said hastily. \u201cCuriosity is a dangerous\r\npetition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUtter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a\r\nsecret, it was a wish for half my estate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I am a\r\nJew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much rather have all your\r\nconfidence. You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to\r\nyour heart?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God\u2019s\r\nsake, don\u2019t desire a useless burden! Don\u2019t long for poison\u2014don\u2019t turn out a\r\ndownright Eve on my hands!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be\r\nconquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don\u2019t you think I had\r\nbetter take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat\u2014even\r\ncry and be sulky if necessary\u2014for the sake of a mere essay of my power?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows have\r\nbecome as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very\r\nastonishing poetry, I once saw styled, \u2018a blue-piled thunderloft.\u2019 That will be\r\nyour married look, sir, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up\r\nthe notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had you to\r\nask, thing,\u2014out with it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal better\r\nthan flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This is what I\r\nhave to ask,\u2014Why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry\r\nMiss Ingram?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that all? Thank God it is no worse!\u201d And now he unknit his black brows;\r\nlooked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well pleased at seeing a\r\ndanger averted. \u201cI think I may confess,\u201d he continued, \u201ceven although I should\r\nmake you a little indignant, Jane\u2014and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be\r\nwhen you are indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you\r\nmutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-bye, it\r\nwas you who made me the offer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course I did. But to the point if you please, sir\u2014Miss Ingram?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as\r\nmadly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the best\r\nally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! Now you are small\u2014not one whit bigger than the end of my little\r\nfinger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way.\r\nDid you think nothing of Miss Ingram\u2019s feelings, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHer feelings are concentrated in one\u2014pride; and that needs humbling. Were you\r\njealous, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know that.\r\nAnswer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your\r\ndishonest coquetry? Won\u2019t she feel forsaken and deserted?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u2014when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of\r\nmy insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your principles\r\non some points are eccentric.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little awry for\r\nwant of attention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnce again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to\r\nme, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself\r\nfelt a while ago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the world has\r\nthe same pure love for me as yourself\u2014for I lay that pleasant unction to my\r\nsoul, Jane, a belief in your affection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very\r\nmuch\u2014more than I could trust myself to say\u2014more than words had power to\r\nexpress.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAsk something more,\u201d he said presently; \u201cit is my delight to be entreated, and\r\nto yield.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was again ready with my request. \u201cCommunicate your intentions to Mrs.\r\nFairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked.\r\nGive her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me to be misjudged\r\nby so good a woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo to your room, and put on your bonnet,\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean you to accompany\r\nme to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the drive, I will\r\nenlighten the old lady\u2019s understanding. Did she think, Janet, you had given the\r\nworld for love, and considered it well lost?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStation! station!\u2014your station is in my heart, and on the necks of those who\r\nwould insult you, now or hereafter.\u2014Go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour,\r\nI hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her morning portion of\r\nScripture\u2014the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open before her, and her\r\nspectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester\u2019s\r\nannouncement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite,\r\nexpressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me,\r\nshe roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words\r\nof congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned\r\nunfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair\r\nback from the table.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI feel so astonished,\u201d she began, \u201cI hardly know what to say to you, Miss\r\nEyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half fall asleep\r\nwhen I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. It has\r\nseemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband,\r\nwho died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I\r\nhave even heard him call me by my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you\r\ntell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry\r\nhim? Don\u2019t laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago,\r\nand said that in a month you would be his wife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe has said the same thing to me,\u201d I replied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked at me bewildered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were\r\nproud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always been called\r\ncareful. He means to marry you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe tells me so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there found no\r\ncharm powerful enough to solve the enigma.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt passes me!\u201d she continued; \u201cbut no doubt it is true since you say so. How\r\nit will answer, I cannot tell: I really don\u2019t know. Equality of position and\r\nfortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of\r\ndifference in your ages. He might almost be your father.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d exclaimed I, nettled; \u201che is nothing like my\r\nfather! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant. Mr.\r\nRochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-twenty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it really for love he is going to marry you?\u201d she asked.\r\n\n\r\nI was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to grieve you,\u201d pursued the widow; \u201cbut you are so young, and so\r\nlittle acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard. It is an old\r\nsaying that \u2018all is not gold that glitters;\u2019 and in this case I do fear there\r\nwill be something found to be different to what either you or I expect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u2014am I a monster?\u201d I said: \u201cis it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have\r\na sincere affection for me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I\r\ndaresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of\r\nhis. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his\r\nmarked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like\r\nto suggest even the possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock,\r\nperhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and\r\nsensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot\r\ntell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you\r\nnowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o\u2019clock, saw you come in\r\nwith him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, never mind that now,\u201d I interrupted impatiently; \u201cit is enough that all\r\nwas right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope all will be right in the end,\u201d she said: \u201cbut believe me, you cannot be\r\ntoo careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust yourself as\r\nwell as him. Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their\r\ngovernesses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was growing truly irritated: happily, Ad\u00e8le ran in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me go,\u2014let me go to Millcote too!\u201d she cried. \u201cMr. Rochester won\u2019t: though\r\nthere is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let me go, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I will, Ad\u00e8le;\u201d and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my gloomy\r\nmonitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front,\r\nand my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and\r\nforwards.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAd\u00e8le may accompany us, may she not, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI told her no. I\u2019ll have no brats!\u2014I\u2019ll have only you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot it: she will be a restraint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s\r\nwarnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of\r\nunsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the sense of\r\npower over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without further\r\nremonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he asked; \u201call the sunshine is gone. Do you really wish\r\nthe bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would far rather she went, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!\u201d cried he to\r\nAd\u00e8le.\r\n\n\r\nShe obeyed him with what speed she might.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, a single morning\u2019s interruption will not matter much,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cwhen I mean shortly to claim you\u2014your thoughts, conversation, and company\u2014for\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her gratitude\r\nfor my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other\r\nside of him. She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too\r\nrestrictive: to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no\r\nobservations, nor ask of him any information.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet her come to me,\u201d I entreated: \u201cshe will, perhaps, trouble you, sir: there\r\nis plenty of room on this side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. \u201cI\u2019ll send her to school yet,\u201d\r\nhe said, but now he was smiling.\r\n\n\r\nAd\u00e8le heard him, and asked if she was to go to school \u201csans mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cabsolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take mademoiselle\r\nto the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among\r\nthe volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,\u201d observed Ad\u00e8le.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides in\r\nthe moon are bleached with manna, Ad\u00e8le.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I\u2019ll carry her up to\r\na peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, qu\u2019elle y sera mal\u2014peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will wear out:\r\nhow can she get new ones?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. \u201cHem!\u201d said he. \u201cWhat would you do,\r\nAd\u00e8le? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a pink cloud\r\nanswer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of\r\na rainbow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is far better as she is,\u201d concluded Ad\u00e8le, after musing some time:\r\n\u201cbesides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I were\r\nmademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has consented: she has pledged her word.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and\r\nneither you nor she can fly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAd\u00e8le, look at that field.\u201d We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling\r\nlightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the\r\nthunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side\r\nglistened green and rain-refreshed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn that field, Ad\u00e8le, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight\r\nsince\u2014the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows;\r\nand, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and\r\nthere I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a\r\nmisfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I\r\nwas writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when\r\nsomething came up the path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was\r\na little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near\r\nme; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in\r\nwords; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was\r\nto this effect\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me\r\nhappy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place\u2014such as the\r\nmoon, for instance\u2014and it nodded its head towards her horn, rising over\r\nHay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live.\r\nI said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings\r\nto fly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 returned the fairy, \u2018that does not signify! Here is a talisman will\r\nremove all difficulties;\u2019 and she held out a pretty gold ring. \u2018Put it,\u2019 she\r\nsaid, \u2018on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine;\r\nand we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.\u2019 She nodded again at\r\nthe moon. The ring, Ad\u00e8le, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a\r\nsovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don\u2019t care for the fairy: you said\r\nit was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle is a fairy,\u201d he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told\r\nher not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund of genuine\r\nFrench scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester \u201cun vrai menteur,\u201d and assuring\r\nhim that she made no account whatever of his \u201ccontes de f\u00e9e,\u201d and that \u201cdu\r\nreste, il n\u2019y avait pas de f\u00e9es, et quand m\u00eame il y en avait:\u201d she was sure\r\nthey would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with\r\nhim in the moon.\r\n\n\r\nThe hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester\r\nobliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose\r\nhalf-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no\u2014it\r\nshould be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic\r\nwhispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he vowed he would\r\nselect himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he\r\nfixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink\r\nsatin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a\r\ngold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear\r\nhis choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\r\npersuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\r\npearl-grey silk. \u201cIt might pass for the present,\u201d he said; \u201cbut he would yet\r\nsee me glittering like a parterre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGlad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jeweller\u2019s\r\nshop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance\r\nand degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and\r\nfagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had\r\nwholly forgotten\u2014the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention\r\nto adopt me and make me his legatee. \u201cIt would, indeed, be a relief,\u201d I\r\nthought, \u201cif I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being\r\ndressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the\r\ngolden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get\r\nhome, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had\r\nbut a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I\r\ncould better endure to be kept by him now.\u201d And somewhat relieved by this idea\r\n(which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my\r\nmaster\u2019s and lover\u2019s eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I\r\naverted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a\r\nsultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and\r\ngems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,\r\nand thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need not look in that way,\u201d I said; \u201cif you do, I\u2019ll wear nothing but my\r\nold Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I\u2019ll be married in this lilac\r\ngingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk,\r\nand an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe chuckled; he rubbed his hands. \u201cOh, it is rich to see and hear her!\u201d he\r\nexclaimed. \u201cIs she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange this one\r\nlittle English girl for the Grand Turk\u2019s whole seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri\r\nforms, and all!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe Eastern allusion bit me again. \u201cI\u2019ll not stand you an inch in the stead of\r\na seraglio,\u201d I said; \u201cso don\u2019t consider me an equivalent for one. If you have a\r\nfancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul\r\nwithout delay, and lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash\r\nyou seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of flesh\r\nand such an assortment of black eyes?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them\r\nthat are enslaved\u2014your harem inmates amongst the rest. I\u2019ll get admitted there,\r\nand I\u2019ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in\r\na trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent\r\nto cut your bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot\r\never yet conferred.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an eye\r\nlike that. While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever charter you\r\nmight grant under coercion, your first act, when released, would be to violate\r\nits conditions.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go through a\r\nprivate marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar. You will\r\nstipulate, I see, for peculiar terms\u2014what will they be?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do you\r\nremember what you said of C\u00e9line Varens?\u2014of the diamonds, the cashmeres you\r\ngave her? I will not be your English C\u00e9line Varens. I shall continue to act as\r\nAd\u00e8le\u2019s governess; by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds\r\na year besides. I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall\r\ngive me nothing but\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, but what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven\u2019t your\r\nequal,\u201d said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. \u201cWill it please you to\r\ndine with me to-day?\u201d he asked, as we re-entered the gates.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what for, \u2018no, thank you?\u2019 if one may inquire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTill what? You delight in half-phrases.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTill I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the\r\ncompanion of my repast?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual\r\nfor another month.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will give up your governessing slavery at once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with it as\r\nusual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been accustomed to do:\r\nyou may send for me in the evening, when you feel disposed to see me, and I\u2019ll\r\ncome then; but at no other time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, \u2018pour\r\nme donner une contenance,\u2019 as Ad\u00e8le would say; and unfortunately I have neither\r\nmy cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But listen\u2014whisper. It is your time now,\r\nlittle tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when once I have fairly\r\nseized you, to have and to hold, I\u2019ll just\u2014figuratively speaking\u2014attach you to\r\na chain like this\u201d (touching his watch-guard). \u201cYes, bonny wee thing, I\u2019ll wear\r\nyou in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he\r\nafterwards lifted out Ad\u00e8le, I entered the house, and made good my retreat\r\nupstairs.\r\n\n\r\nHe duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an\r\noccupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a\r\nt\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked\r\nto sing\u2014good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and, in his\r\nfastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in listening when the\r\nperformance was good. No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to\r\nlower her blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the\r\npiano, and entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I\r\nwas a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time; but I\r\naverred that no time was like the present.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I like his voice?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery much.\u201d I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his; but\r\nfor once, and from motives of expediency, I would e\u2019en soothe and stimulate it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir, I will try.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated \u201ca little\r\nbungler.\u201d Being pushed unceremoniously to one side\u2014which was precisely what I\r\nwished\u2014he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could\r\nplay as well as sing. I hied me to the window-recess. And while I sat there and\r\nlooked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow\r\ntones the following strain:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe truest love that ever heart\r\nFelt at its kindled core,\r\nDid through each vein, in quickened start,\r\nThe tide of being pour.\n\r\nHer coming was my hope each day,\r\nHer parting was my pain;\r\nThe chance that did her steps delay\r\nWas ice in every vein.\n\r\nI dreamed it would be nameless bliss,\r\nAs I loved, loved to be;\r\nAnd to this object did I press\r\nAs blind as eagerly.\n\r\nBut wide as pathless was the space\r\nThat lay our lives between,\r\nAnd dangerous as the foamy race\r\nOf ocean-surges green.\n\r\nAnd haunted as a robber-path\r\nThrough wilderness or wood;\r\nFor Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,\r\nBetween our spirits stood.\n\r\nI dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;\r\nI omens did defy:\r\nWhatever menaced, harassed, warned,\r\nI passed impetuous by.\n\r\nOn sped my rainbow, fast as light;\r\nI flew as in a dream;\r\nFor glorious rose upon my sight\r\nThat child of Shower and Gleam.\n\r\nStill bright on clouds of suffering dim\r\nShines that soft, solemn joy;\r\nNor care I now, how dense and grim\r\nDisasters gather nigh.\n\r\nI care not in this moment sweet,\r\nThough all I have rushed o\u2019er\r\nShould come on pinion, strong and fleet,\r\nProclaiming vengeance sore:\n\r\nThough haughty Hate should strike me down,\r\nRight, bar approach to me,\r\nAnd grinding Might, with furious frown,\r\nSwear endless enmity.\n\r\nMy love has placed her little hand\r\nWith noble faith in mine,\r\nAnd vowed that wedlock\u2019s sacred band\r\nOur nature shall entwine.\n\r\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\r\nWith me to live\u2014to die;\r\nI have at last my nameless bliss.\r\nAs I love\u2014loved am I!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full\r\nfalcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament. I quailed\r\nmomentarily\u2014then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have;\r\nand I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared\u2014I whetted my\r\ntongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity, \u201cwhom he was going to marry\r\nnow?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his\r\nfuture wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? I had\r\nno intention of dying with him\u2014he might depend on that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him! Death\r\nwas not for such as I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had: but I\r\nshould bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling\r\nkiss?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I would rather be excused.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere I heard myself apostrophised as a \u201chard little thing;\u201d and it was added,\r\n\u201cany other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas\r\ncrooned in her praise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI assured him I was naturally hard\u2014very flinty, and that he would often find me\r\nso; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my\r\ncharacter before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort\r\nof a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould I be quiet and talk rationally?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself\r\nI was doing that now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe fretted, pished, and pshawed. \u201cVery good,\u201d I thought; \u201cyou may fume and\r\nfidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am\r\ncertain. I like you more than I can say; but I\u2019ll not sink into a bathos of\r\nsentiment: and with this needle of repartee I\u2019ll keep you from the edge of the\r\ngulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you\r\nand myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFrom less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, after he\r\nhad retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and\r\nsaying, \u201cI wish you good-night, sir,\u201d in my natural and wonted respectful\r\nmanner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.\r\n\n\r\nThe system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and\r\nwith the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on\r\nthe whole I could see he was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like\r\nsubmission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more,\r\nwould have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited\r\nhis taste less.\r\n\n\r\nIn other people\u2019s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other\r\nline of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I\r\nthus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for me punctually the\r\nmoment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no\r\nsuch honeyed terms as \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d on his lips: the best words at my\r\nservice were \u201cprovoking puppet,\u201d \u201cmalicious elf,\u201d \u201csprite,\u201d \u201cchangeling,\u201d\r\n&c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a\r\npinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was\r\nall right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything\r\nmore tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account\r\nvanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed\r\nI was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my\r\npresent conduct at some period fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his\r\nmenaces. \u201cI can keep you in reasonable check now,\u201d I reflected; \u201cand I don\u2019t\r\ndoubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another\r\nmust be devised.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased\r\nthan teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more\r\nthan the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought\r\nof religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could\r\nnot, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.\r\n\n"}
{"27": "\nCHAPTER XXV\n\r\nThe month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered.\r\nThere was no putting off the day that advanced\u2014the bridal day; and all\r\npreparations for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had nothing\r\nmore to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along\r\nthe wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on\r\ntheir road to London: and so should I (D.V.),\u2014or rather, not I, but one Jane\r\nRochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained\r\nto nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had\r\nhimself written the direction, \u201cMrs. Rochester, \u2014\u2014 Hotel, London,\u201d on each: I\r\ncould not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs.\r\nRochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time\r\nafter eight o\u2019clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had\r\ncome into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was\r\nenough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be\r\nhers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for\r\nnot to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe,\r\nthe vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to\r\nconceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening\r\nhour\u2014nine o\u2019clock\u2014gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow\r\nof my apartment. \u201cI will leave you by yourself, white dream,\u201d I said. \u201cI am\r\nfeverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only the\r\nanticipation of the great change\u2014the new life which was to commence to-morrow:\r\nboth these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in producing that\r\nrestless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late hour into the\r\ndarkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind more than they.\r\n\n\r\nI had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened which I\r\ncould not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but myself: it had\r\ntaken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home;\r\nnor was he yet returned: business had called him to a small estate of two or\r\nthree farms he possessed thirty miles off\u2014business it was requisite he should\r\nsettle in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited\r\nnow his return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of\r\nthe enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose\r\nmy secret to him, you shall share the confidence.\r\n\n\r\nI sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had\r\nblown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of\r\nrain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to augment its rush and\r\ndeepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and\r\nscarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the\r\nstrain bending their branchy heads northward\u2014the clouds drifted from pole to\r\npole, fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible\r\nthat July day.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my\r\ntrouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space.\r\nDescending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up\r\nblack and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven\r\nhalves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept\r\nthem unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed\u2014the sap could\r\nflow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter\u2019s\r\ntempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they\r\nmight be said to form one tree\u2014a ruin, but an entire ruin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did right to hold fast to each other,\u201d I said: as if the monster-splinters\r\nwere living things, and could hear me. \u201cI think, scathed as you look, and\r\ncharred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising\r\nout of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green\r\nleaves more\u2014never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs;\r\nthe time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each\r\nof you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.\u201d As I looked up at\r\nthem, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their\r\nfissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me\r\none bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep\r\ndrift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away\r\nover wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to,\r\nand I ran off again.\r\n\n\r\nHere and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which\r\nthe grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in\r\ndividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them\r\naway in the store-room. Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the\r\nfire was lit, for, though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester\r\nwould like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been\r\nkindled some time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the\r\nchimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had\r\nthe candles brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had\r\ncompleted these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the\r\nhouse: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall\r\nsimultaneously struck ten.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow late it grows!\u201d I said. \u201cI will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at\r\nintervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be coming now, and to meet\r\nhim will save some minutes of suspense.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road\r\nas far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and\r\nsolitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon\r\nlooked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.\r\n\n\r\nA puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked\u2014a tear of disappointment and\r\nimpatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon shut herself\r\nwholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night\r\ngrew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish he would come! I wish he would come!\u201d I exclaimed, seized with\r\nhypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it was\r\ndark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of last night\r\nagain recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of disaster. I feared my\r\nhopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately\r\nthat I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I cannot return to the house,\u201d I thought; \u201cI cannot sit by the fireside,\r\nwhile he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my\r\nheart; I will go forward and meet him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile,\r\nI heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by his\r\nside. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour,\r\nfollowed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky,\r\nand rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head.\r\nI now ran to meet him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the saddle:\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe; give me both\r\nhands: mount!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I got for\r\na welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well as I could. He\r\nchecked himself in his exultation to demand, \u201cBut is there anything the matter,\r\nJanet, that you come to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in the house\r\nfor you, especially with this rain and wind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak\r\nround you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and hand are\r\nburning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you have been both?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather: but I\u2019ll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I daresay you will\r\nonly laugh at me for my pains.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my\r\nprize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this\r\nlast month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere\r\nbut I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms.\r\nYou wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wanted you: but don\u2019t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me get\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed me into\r\nthe hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to\r\nhim in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a\r\npromise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined\r\nhim. I found him at supper.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal but one\r\nyou will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is it the\r\nthoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what\r\nthoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcept me: I am substantial enough\u2014touch me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held out his hand, laughing. \u201cIs that a dream?\u201d said he, placing it close to\r\nmy eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long,\r\nstrong arm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; though I touch it, it is a dream,\u201d said I, as I put it down from before\r\nmy face. \u201cSir, have you finished supper?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I stirred\r\nthe fire, and then took a low seat at my master\u2019s knee.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is near midnight,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my\r\nwedding.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish\r\nto go to bed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre all your arrangements complete?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd on my part likewise,\u201d he returned, \u201cI have settled everything; and we\r\nshall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return from\r\nchurch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word\u2014\u2018very well,\u2019 Jane! What\r\na bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes\r\nglitter! Are you well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe I am.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBelieve! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this present\r\nhour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or over-fatigued.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you, sir, feel calm and happy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCalm?\u2014no: but happy\u2014to the heart\u2019s core.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and\r\nflushed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive me your confidence, Jane,\u201d he said: \u201crelieve your mind of any weight that\r\noppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?\u2014that I shall not prove a\r\ngood husband?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is the idea farthest from my thoughts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?\u2014of the new life\r\ninto which you are passing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain\r\nme. I want an explanation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, sir, listen. You were from home last night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened\r\nin my absence:\u2014nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has\r\ndisturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you\r\nhave overheard the servants talk?\u2014your sensitive self-respect has been\r\nwounded?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d It struck twelve\u2014I waited till the time-piece had concluded its\r\nsilver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I proceeded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless bustle; for\r\nI am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new\r\nsphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with\r\nyou, because I love you. No, sir, don\u2019t caress me now\u2014let me talk undisturbed.\r\nYesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working\r\ntogether for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect\u2014the\r\ncalmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or\r\ncomfort on your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,\r\nthinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed\r\nyour actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me\u2014your\r\nlife, sir\u2014an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so\r\nas the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its\r\nown strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary\r\nwilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned\r\ncold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my\r\nwedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found\r\nyour present\u2014the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from\r\nLondon: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into\r\naccepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I\r\nwould tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your\r\nplebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down\r\nto you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering\r\nfor my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could\r\nbring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how\r\nyou would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty\r\ndisavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your\r\nstanding, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow well you read me, you witch!\u201d interposed Mr. Rochester: \u201cbut what did you\r\nfind in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison, or a dagger, that\r\nyou look so mournful now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing\r\nsave Fairfax Rochester\u2019s pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to\r\nthe sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew\r\nyesterday evening, not as it blows now\u2014wild and high\u2014but \u2018with a sullen,\r\nmoaning sound\u2019 far more eerie. I wished you were at home. I came into this\r\nroom, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some\r\ntime after I went to bed, I could not sleep\u2014a sense of anxious excitement\r\ndistressed me. The gale still rising seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful\r\nunder-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it\r\nrecurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be\r\nsome dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I\r\ncontinued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the\r\nwish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some\r\nbarrier dividing us. During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of\r\nan unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened\r\nwith the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble\r\nto walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I\r\nthought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained\r\nevery nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and\r\nentreat you to stop\u2014but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died\r\naway inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every\r\nmoment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to you?\r\nLittle nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness!\r\nYou say you love me, Janet: yes\u2014I will not forget that; and you cannot deny it.\r\nThose words did not die inarticulate on your lips. I heard them clear\r\nand soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music\u2014\u2018I think it is a\r\nglorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because I love\r\nyou.\u2019 Do you love me, Jane?\u2014repeat it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do, sir\u2014I do, with my whole heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, after some minutes\u2019 silence, \u201cit is strange; but that sentence\r\nhas penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you said it with such\r\nan earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the\r\nvery sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit\r\nwere near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your\r\nwild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me\u2014tease me, vex me; do anything\r\nbut move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will tease you and vex you to your heart\u2019s content, when I have finished my\r\ntale: but hear me to the end.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your\r\nmelancholy in a dream.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cWhat! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything\r\nimportant. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his manner,\r\nsurprised me: but I proceeded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the\r\nretreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing\r\nremained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered,\r\non a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled\r\nover a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up\r\nin a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down\r\nanywhere, however tired were my arms\u2014however much its weight impeded my\r\nprogress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\r\nroad; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a\r\ndistant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to\r\ncatch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet,\r\nthe ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror,\r\nand almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on\r\na white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not\r\nstand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap:\r\nyou turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall\r\ncrumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell,\r\nand woke.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jane, that is all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my\r\neyes; I thought\u2014Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it was only\r\ncandlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the\r\ndressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had\r\nhung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked,\r\n\u2018Sophie, what are you doing?\u2019 No one answered; but a form emerged from the\r\ncloset; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent\r\nfrom the portmanteau. \u2018Sophie! Sophie!\u2019 I again cried: and still it was silent.\r\nI had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came\r\nover me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was\r\nnot Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not\u2014no, I was sure\r\nof it, and am still\u2014it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been one of them,\u201d interrupted my master.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing before me\r\nhad never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the\r\nheight, the contour were new to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDescribe it, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long\r\ndown her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but\r\nwhether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you see her face?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up,\r\ngazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the\r\nmirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite\r\ndistinctly in the dark oblong glass.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how were they?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFearful and ghastly to me\u2014oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a\r\ndiscoloured face\u2014it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the\r\nred eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGhosts are usually pale, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the\r\nblack eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what\r\nit reminded me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf the foul German spectre\u2014the Vampyre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u2014what did it do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and\r\nflinging both on the floor, trampled on them.\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cAfterwards?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn\r\napproaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at my\r\nbedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me\u2014she thrust up her\r\ncandle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes. I was aware her\r\nlurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in\r\nmy life\u2014only the second time\u2014I became insensible from terror.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho was with you when you revived?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in water,\r\ndrank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined\r\nthat to none but you would I impart this vision. Now, sir, tell me who and what\r\nthat woman was?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be careful\r\nof you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the\r\ntransaction actually took place.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a ruin? Am I\r\nsevered from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you without a\r\ntear\u2014without a kiss\u2014without a word?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us\r\nindissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of\r\nthese mental terrors: I guarantee that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I wish it\r\nmore now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the mystery of that\r\nawful visitant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I looked\r\nround the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each\r\nfamiliar object in full daylight, there\u2014on the carpet\u2014I saw what gave the\r\ndistinct lie to my hypothesis,\u2014the veil, torn from top to bottom in two\r\nhalves!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round me.\r\n\u201cThank God!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat if anything malignant did come near you last\r\nnight, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think what might have\r\nhappened!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could scarcely\r\npant. After some minutes\u2019 silence, he continued, cheerily\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Janet, I\u2019ll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half reality.\r\nA woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was\u2014must have\r\nbeen\u2014Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you\r\nhave reason so to call her\u2014what did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state\r\nbetween sleeping and waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but\r\nfeverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance\r\ndifferent from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the\r\nexaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the\r\nspiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you would ask\r\nwhy I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a\r\nday, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my\r\nsolution of the mystery?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I\r\nwas not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so\u2014relieved, I certainly did\r\nfeel; so I answered him with a contented smile. And now, as it was long past\r\none, I prepared to leave him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes not Sophie sleep with Ad\u00e8le in the nursery?\u201d he asked, as I lit my\r\ncandle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd there is room enough in Ad\u00e8le\u2019s little bed for you. You must share it with\r\nher to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have related should\r\nmake you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go\r\nto the nursery.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall be very glad to do so, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go upstairs,\r\nunder pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-morrow; for you\r\nmust be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight. And now, no more\r\nsombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet. Don\u2019t you hear to what soft\r\nwhispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the\r\nwindow-panes: look here\u201d (he lifted up the curtain)\u2014\u201cit is a lovely night!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping before the\r\nwind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward in long, silvered\r\ncolumns. The moon shone peacefully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, \u201chow is my Janet\r\nnow?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe night is serene, sir; and so am I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love\r\nand blissful union.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow, but\r\nas little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all. With little Ad\u00e8le in my\r\narms, I watched the slumber of childhood\u2014so tranquil, so passionless, so\r\ninnocent\u2014and waited for the coming day: all my life was awake and astir in my\r\nframe: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too. I remember Ad\u00e8le clung to me as\r\nI left her: I remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my\r\nneck; and I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I\r\nfeared my sobs would break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my\r\npast life; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored,\r\ntype of my unknown future day.\r\n\n"}
{"28": "\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\r\nSophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in accomplishing her\r\ntask; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, impatient of my delay, sent\r\nup to ask why I did not come. She was just fastening my veil (the plain square\r\nof blond after all) to my hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as\r\nsoon as I could.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d she cried in French. \u201cLook at yourself in the mirror: you have not\r\ntaken one peep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual\r\nself that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. \u201cJane!\u201d called a voice, and\r\nI hastened down. I was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLingerer!\u201d he said, \u201cmy brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry so\r\nlong!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced me\r\n\u201cfair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his\r\neyes,\u201d and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat some\r\nbreakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately hired servants, a footman,\r\nanswered it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs John getting the carriage ready?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs the luggage brought down?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are bringing it down, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there:\r\nreturn and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the footman\r\nsoon returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the carriage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe horses are harnessing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we\r\nreturn: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in\r\nhis seat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, are you ready?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or\r\nmarshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we\r\npassed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was held by a grasp of\r\niron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr.\r\nRochester\u2019s face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for\r\nany purpose. I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did\u2014so bent up to\r\na purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever\r\nrevealed such flaming and flashing eyes.\r\n\n\r\nI know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed\r\nneither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated\r\ninto Mr. Rochester\u2019s frame. I wanted to see the invisible thing on which, as we\r\nwent along, he appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel\r\nthe thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting.\r\n\n\r\nAt the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of breath.\r\n\u201cAm I cruel in my love?\u201d he said. \u201cDelay an instant: lean on me, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm\r\nbefore me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond.\r\nI remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten,\r\neither, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading\r\nthe mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as\r\nthey saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not\r\nthey were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony. By\r\nMr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face, from\r\nwhich the blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy,\r\nand my cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently\r\nwith me up the path to the porch.\r\n\n\r\nWe entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white surplice\r\nat the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two shadows only moved\r\nin a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct: the strangers had slipped\r\nin before us, and they now stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs\r\ntowards us, viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a\r\nkneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor\r\nin the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.\r\n\n\r\nOur place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step behind me,\r\nI glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers\u2014a gentleman, evidently\u2014was\r\nadvancing up the chancel. The service began. The explanation of the intent of\r\nmatrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward,\r\nand, bending slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of\r\njudgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if either of\r\nyou know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in\r\nmatrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that so many as are\r\ncoupled together otherwise than God\u2019s Word doth allow, are not joined together\r\nby God, neither is their matrimony lawful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken\r\nby reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the clergyman, who had not\r\nlifted his eyes from his book, and had held his breath but for a moment, was\r\nproceeding: his hand was already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips\r\nunclosed to ask, \u201cWilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?\u201d\u2014when a\r\ndistinct and near voice said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same;\r\nMr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet:\r\ntaking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he said, \u201cProceed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nProfound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low\r\nintonation. Presently Mr. Wood said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and\r\nevidence of its truth or falsehood.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ceremony is quite broken off,\u201d subjoined the voice behind us. \u201cI am in a\r\ncondition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage\r\nexists.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making no\r\nmovement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and strong grasp he had!\r\nand how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive front at this moment!\r\nHow his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild beneath!\r\n\n\r\nMr. Wood seemed at a loss. \u201cWhat is the nature of the impediment?\u201d he asked.\r\n\u201cPerhaps it may be got over\u2014explained away?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d was the answer. \u201cI have called it insuperable, and I speak\r\nadvisedly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued, uttering each\r\nword distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr. Rochester has\r\na wife now living.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to\r\nthunder\u2014my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire;\r\nbut I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I\r\nmade him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark\r\nand flint. He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.\r\nWithout speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human\r\nbeing, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked of the intruder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Briggs, a solicitor of \u2014\u2014 Street, London.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you would thrust on me a wife?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would remind you of your lady\u2019s existence, sir, which the law recognises, if\r\nyou do not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFavour me with an account of her\u2014with her name, her parentage, her place of\r\nabode.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read out in a\r\nsort of official, nasal voice:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. \u2014\u2014 (a date of fifteen\r\nyears back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of \u2014\u2014,\r\nand of Ferndean Manor, in \u2014\u2014shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha\r\nAntoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his\r\nwife, a Creole, at \u2014\u2014 church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage\r\nwill be found in the register of that church\u2014a copy of it is now in my\r\npossession. Signed, Richard Mason.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2014if a genuine document\u2014may prove I have been married, but it does not\r\nprove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was living three months ago,\u201d returned the lawyer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely\r\ncontrovert.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProduce him\u2014or go to hell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will produce him first\u2014he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the goodness to\r\nstep forward.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a sort\r\nof strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the spasmodic\r\nmovement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second stranger, who had\r\nhitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the\r\nsolicitor\u2019s shoulder\u2014yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared\r\nat him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny,\r\nnay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed\u2014olive cheek and hueless\r\nforehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he\r\nstirred, lifted his strong arm\u2014he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the\r\nchurch-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body\u2014but Mason\r\nshrank away, and cried faintly, \u201cGood God!\u201d Contempt fell cool on Mr.\r\nRochester\u2014his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only\r\nasked\u2014\u201cWhat have you to say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAn inaudible reply escaped Mason\u2019s white lips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand, what have\r\nyou to say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir\u2014sir,\u201d interrupted the clergyman, \u201cdo not forget you are in a sacred\r\nplace.\u201d Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, \u201cAre you aware, sir, whether\r\nor not this gentleman\u2019s wife is still living?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCourage,\u201d urged the lawyer,\u2014\u201cspeak out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is now living at Thornfield Hall,\u201d said Mason, in more articulate tones:\r\n\u201cI saw her there last April. I am her brother.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt Thornfield Hall!\u201d ejaculated the clergyman. \u201cImpossible! I am an old\r\nresident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at\r\nThornfield Hall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester\u2019s lips, and he muttered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, by God! I took care that none should hear of it\u2014or of her under that\r\nname.\u201d He mused\u2014for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he formed his\r\nresolve, and announced it\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEnough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel. Wood,\r\nclose your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave\r\nthe church: there will be no wedding to-day.\u201d The man obeyed.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: \u201cBigamy is an ugly word!\u2014I\r\nmeant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence\r\nhas checked me,\u2014perhaps the last. I am little better than a devil at this\r\nmoment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest\r\njudgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my\r\nplan is broken up:\u2014what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been\r\nmarried, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of\r\na Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a\r\ntime inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under\r\nwatch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:\r\nsome, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I\r\nmarried fifteen years ago,\u2014Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute\r\npersonage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you\r\nwhat a stout heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!\u2014never fear me!\u2014I\u2019d almost as\r\nsoon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family;\r\nidiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both\r\na madwoman and a drunkard!\u2014as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for\r\nthey were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied\r\nher parent in both points. I had a charming partner\u2014pure, wise, modest: you can\r\nfancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been\r\nheavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs,\r\nWood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole\u2019s\r\npatient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated\r\ninto espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact,\r\nand seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl,\u201d he continued,\r\nlooking at me, \u201cknew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she\r\nthought all was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped\r\ninto a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and\r\nembruted partner! Come all of you\u2014follow!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came after. At\r\nthe front door of the hall we found the carriage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake it back to the coach-house, John,\u201d said Mr. Rochester coolly; \u201cit will\r\nnot be wanted to-day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Ad\u00e8le, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet\r\nus.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo the right-about\u2014every soul!\u201d cried the master; \u201caway with your\r\ncongratulations! Who wants them? Not I!\u2014they are fifteen years too late!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\r\nbeckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the first\r\nstaircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black\r\ndoor, opened by Mr. Rochester\u2019s master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room,\r\nwith its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know this place, Mason,\u201d said our guide; \u201cshe bit and stabbed you here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he\r\nopened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and\r\nstrong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole\r\nbent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the deep\r\nshade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards.\r\nWhat it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell:\r\nit grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some\r\nstrange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark,\r\ngrizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-morrow, Mrs. Poole!\u201d said Mr. Rochester. \u201cHow are you? and how is your\r\ncharge to-day?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re tolerable, sir, I thank you,\u201d replied Grace, lifting the boiling mess\r\ncarefully on to the hob: \u201crather snappish, but not \u2019rageous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed hyena\r\nrose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! sir, she sees you!\u201d exclaimed Grace: \u201cyou\u2019d better not stay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake care then, sir!\u2014for God\u2019s sake, take care!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed\r\nwildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,\u2014those bloated\r\nfeatures. Mrs. Poole advanced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep out of the way,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: \u201cshe has no\r\nknife now, I suppose, and I\u2019m on my guard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal\r\ndiscretion to fathom her craft.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe had better leave her,\u201d whispered Mason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo to the devil!\u201d was his brother-in-law\u2019s recommendation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Ware!\u201d cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.\r\nRochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat\r\nviciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She was a big\r\nwoman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent besides: she\r\nshowed virile force in the contest\u2014more than once she almost throttled him,\r\nathletic as he was. He could have settled her with a well-planted blow; but he\r\nwould not strike: he would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace\r\nPoole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which\r\nwas at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the\r\nfiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to\r\nthe spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is my wife,\u201d said he. \u201cSuch is the sole conjugal embrace I am ever\r\nto know\u2014such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure hours! And\r\nthis is what I wished to have\u201d (laying his hand on my shoulder): \u201cthis\r\nyoung girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking\r\ncollectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just as a change after that\r\nfierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Compare these clear\r\neyes with the red balls yonder\u2014this face with that mask\u2014this form with that\r\nbulk; then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with\r\nwhat judgment ye judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my\r\nprize.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some further\r\norder to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he descended the stair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, madam,\u201d said he, \u201care cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to\r\nhear it\u2014if, indeed, he should be still living\u2014when Mr. Mason returns to\r\nMadeira.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle! What of him? Do you know him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his house for\r\nsome years. When your uncle received your letter intimating the contemplated\r\nunion between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira\r\nto recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr.\r\nEyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted\r\nwith a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed\r\nas you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry\r\nto say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\r\ndisease\u2014decline\u2014and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise.\r\nHe could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare\r\ninto which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking\r\nsteps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me for assistance. I\r\nused all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must\r\nbe also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach\r\nMadeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think\r\nyou had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of\r\nMr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?\u201d he inquired of Mr. Mason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2014let us be gone,\u201d was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take\r\nleave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The clergyman\r\nstayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his\r\nhaughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\r\n\n\r\nI heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which I had\r\nnow withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none\r\nmight intrude, and proceeded\u2014not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for\r\nthat, but\u2014mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the\r\nstuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat\r\ndown: I felt weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped\r\non them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved\u2014followed up\r\nand down where I was led or dragged\u2014watched event rush on event, disclosure\r\nopen beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.\r\n\n\r\nThe morning had been a quiet morning enough\u2014all except the brief scene with the\r\nlunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there was no\r\nexplosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance or\r\nchallenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced\r\nobjection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr.\r\nRochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of\r\nthe truth had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen;\r\nthe intruders were gone, and all was over.\r\n\n\r\nI was in my own room as usual\u2014just myself, without obvious change: nothing had\r\nsmitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was the Jane Eyre of\r\nyesterday?\u2014where was her life?\u2014where were her prospects?\r\n\n\r\nJane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman\u2014almost a bride, was a cold,\r\nsolitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A\r\nChristmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over\r\nJune; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield\r\nand cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of\r\nflowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve\r\nhours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread,\r\nwaste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all\r\ndead\u2014struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the\r\nfirst-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\r\nblooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never\r\nrevive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master\u2019s\u2014which he had\r\ncreated; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle;\r\nsickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester\u2019s arms\u2014it\r\ncould not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him;\r\nfor faith was blighted\u2014confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what\r\nhe had been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to\r\nhim; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth\r\nwas gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I\r\nperceived well. When\u2014how\u2014whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I\r\ndoubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he\r\ncould not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he\r\nwould want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must\r\nbe hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!\r\n\n\r\nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and\r\nreflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and\r\neffortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river;\r\nI heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to\r\nrise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead.\r\nOne idea only still throbbed life-like within me\u2014a remembrance of God: it begot\r\nan unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind,\r\nas something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it\u2014as I had\r\nneither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips\u2014it came: in full\r\nheavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life\r\nlorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and\r\nmighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in\r\ntruth, \u201cthe waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing;\r\nI came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"29": "\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\r\nSome time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing the\r\nwestern sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked, \u201cWhat am I to\r\ndo?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut the answer my mind gave\u2014\u201cLeave Thornfield at once\u201d\u2014was so prompt, so dread,\r\nthat I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words now. \u201cThat I am not\r\nEdward Rochester\u2019s bride is the least part of my woe,\u201d I alleged: \u201cthat I have\r\nwakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a\r\nhorror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly,\r\nentirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I\r\nshould do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I\r\nmight avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and\r\nConscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she\r\nhad yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm\r\nof iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me be torn away, then\u201d I cried. \u201cLet another help me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself\r\npluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be\r\nthe victim, and you the priest to transfix it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge\r\nhaunted,\u2014at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood\r\nerect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither\r\nmeat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And,\r\nwith a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no\r\nmessage had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even\r\nlittle Ad\u00e8le had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.\r\n\u201cFriends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,\u201d I murmured, as I undrew\r\nthe bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy,\r\nmy sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I\r\nfell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up\u2014I\r\nwas supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou come out at last,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I have been waiting for you long, and\r\nlistening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of\r\nthat death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar. So you\r\nshun me?\u2014you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and\r\nupbraided me with vehemence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some\r\nkind. I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed\r\non my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched\r\nhandkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a\r\nfaded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping\r\nblood?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter\u2014nothing poignant? Nothing\r\nto cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I have placed you,\r\nand regard me with a weary, passive look.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe\r\nlamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his\r\ncup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles,\r\nhe would not have rued his bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you\r\never forgive me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such deep\r\nremorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his\r\nmanner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and mien\u2014I\r\nforgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my heart\u2019s core.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know I am a scoundrel, Jane?\u201d ere long he inquired wistfully\u2014wondering, I\r\nsuppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness\r\nthan of will.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me so roundly and sharply\u2014don\u2019t spare me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.\u201d He heaved a sort of\r\nshuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At first I\r\ndid not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my glazed sight:\r\npresently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had\r\nbecome icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived;\r\nthen I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the\r\nlibrary\u2014sitting in his chair\u2014he was quite near. \u201cIf I could go out of life now,\r\nwithout too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,\u201d I thought; \u201cthen I should\r\nnot have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from\r\namong Mr. Rochester\u2019s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave\r\nhim\u2014I cannot leave him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow are you now, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMuch better, sir; I shall be well soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTaste the wine again, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and looked\r\nat me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation,\r\nfull of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and\r\ncame back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses\r\nwere now forbidden. I turned my face away and put his aside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u2014How is this?\u201d he exclaimed hastily. \u201cOh, I know! you won\u2019t kiss the\r\nhusband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my embraces\r\nappropriated?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for\r\nyou\u2014Because I have a wife already, you would reply.\u2014I guess rightly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard me as\r\na plotting profligate\u2014a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested\r\nlove in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of\r\nhonour and rob you of self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say\r\nnothing: in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw\r\nyour breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse\r\nand revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would\r\nrush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid,\r\nto make a scene: you are thinking how to act\u2014talking you consider\r\nis of no use. I know you\u2014I am on my guard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I do not wish to act against you,\u201d I said; and my unsteady voice warned\r\nme to curtail my sentence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to\r\ndestroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man\u2014as a married man\r\nyou will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me. You\r\nintend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only\r\nas Ad\u00e8le\u2019s governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly\r\nfeeling inclines you again to me, you will say,\u2014\u2018That man had nearly made me\r\nhis mistress: I must be ice and rock to him;\u2019 and ice and rock you will\r\naccordingly become.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI cleared and steadied my voice to reply: \u201cAll is changed about me, sir; I must\r\nchange too\u2014there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and\r\ncontinual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one\r\nway\u2014Ad\u00e8le must have a new governess, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Ad\u00e8le will go to school\u2014I have settled that already; nor do I mean to\r\ntorment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield\r\nHall\u2014this accursed place\u2014this tent of Achan\u2014this insolent vault, offering the\r\nghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky\u2014this narrow stone\r\nhell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane,\r\nyou shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to\r\nThornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal\r\nfrom you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place;\r\nmerely because I feared Ad\u00e8le never would have a governess to stay if she knew\r\nwith what inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the\r\nmaniac elsewhere\u2014though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more\r\nretired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely enough, had\r\nnot a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood,\r\nmade my conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would\r\nsoon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own vice; and mine is\r\nnot a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConcealing the mad-woman\u2019s neighbourhood from you, however, was something like\r\ncovering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon\u2019s\r\nvicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I\u2019ll shut up Thornfield Hall: I\u2019ll\r\nnail up the front door and board the lower windows: I\u2019ll give Mrs. Poole two\r\nhundred a year to live here with my wife, as you term that fearful hag:\r\nGrace will do much for money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby\r\nRetreat, to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms,\r\nwhen my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at\r\nnight, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d I interrupted him, \u201cyou are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you\r\nspeak of her with hate\u2014with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel\u2014she cannot help\r\nbeing mad.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don\u2019t know\r\nwhat you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad\r\nI hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do indeed, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the\r\nsort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me\r\nas my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear. Your mind is my\r\ntreasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved,\r\nmy arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat\u2014your grasp, even in\r\nfury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did\r\nthis morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would\r\nbe restrictive. I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in\r\nyour quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could\r\nhang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return;\r\nand never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of\r\nrecognition for me.\u2014But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of\r\nremoving you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure:\r\nto-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure one more night under this\r\nroof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a\r\nplace to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful\r\nreminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion\u2014even from falsehood and slander.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd take Ad\u00e8le with you, sir,\u201d I interrupted; \u201cshe will be a companion for\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Ad\u00e8le to school; and what do I\r\nwant with a child for a companion, and not my own child,\u2014a French dancer\u2019s\r\nbastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why do you assign Ad\u00e8le to\r\nme for a companion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull\r\nfor you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSolitude! solitude!\u201d he reiterated with irritation. \u201cI see I must come to an\r\nexplanation. I don\u2019t know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your\r\ncountenance. You are to share my solitude. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was becoming,\r\neven to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking fast about the\r\nroom, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. He looked at me long\r\nand hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire, and tried to\r\nassume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow for the hitch in Jane\u2019s character,\u201d he said at last, speaking more calmly\r\nthan from his look I had expected him to speak. \u201cThe reel of silk has run\r\nsmoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle:\r\nhere it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I\r\nlong to exert a fraction of Samson\u2019s strength, and break the entanglement like\r\ntow!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane! will you hear reason?\u201d (he stooped and approached his lips to my ear);\r\n\u201cbecause, if you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll try violence.\u201d His voice was hoarse; his look that\r\nof a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong\r\ninto wild license. I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy\r\nmore, I should be able to do nothing with him. The present\u2014the passing second\r\nof time\u2014was all I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement of\r\nrepulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,\u2014and his. But I was not\r\nafraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which\r\nsupported me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the\r\nIndian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold\r\nof his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,\r\nsoothingly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit down; I\u2019ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say,\r\nwhether reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been struggling\r\nwith tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I\r\nknew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I considered it well to\r\nlet them flow as freely and as long as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so\r\nmuch the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.\r\n\n\r\nSoon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could not\r\nwhile he was in such a passion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your\r\nlittle pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it.\r\nHush, now, and wipe your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn, became\r\ncalm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but I would not\r\npermit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane! Jane!\u201d he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along\r\nevery nerve I had; \u201cyou don\u2019t love me, then? It was only my station, and the\r\nrank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become\r\nyour husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThese words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to have done\r\nor said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting\r\nhis feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do love you,\u201d I said, \u201cmore than ever: but I must not show or indulge\r\nthe feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see me\r\ndaily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but one\r\nway: but you will be furious if I mention it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I must leave you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair\u2014which is\r\nsomewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face\u2014which looks feverish?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must leave Ad\u00e8le and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole life: I\r\nmust begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about parting from\r\nme. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new existence, it is all\r\nright: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs.\r\nRochester\u2014both virtually and nominally. I shall keep only to you so long as you\r\nand I live. You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a\r\nwhitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a\r\nhappy, and guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you\r\ninto error\u2014to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must\r\nbe reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed: still\r\nI dared to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by\r\nyourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mistress: to\r\nsay otherwise is sophistical\u2014is false.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I am not a gentle-tempered man\u2014you forget that: I am not long-enduring;\r\nI am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself, put your\r\nfinger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and\u2014beware!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and\r\nlips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands. To agitate him\r\nthus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the\r\nquestion. I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to\r\nutter extremity\u2014looked for aid to one higher than man: the words \u201cGod help me!\u201d\r\nburst involuntarily from my lips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a fool!\u201d cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. \u201cI keep telling her I am not\r\nmarried, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows nothing of the\r\ncharacter of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union\r\nwith her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she knows\r\nall that I know! Just put your hand in mine, Janet\u2014that I may have the evidence\r\nof touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me\u2014and I will in a few words\r\nshow you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for hours if you will.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest\r\nson of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have understood something to that effect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he\r\ncould not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion:\r\nall, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he\r\nendure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a\r\nwealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India\r\nplanter and merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions\r\nwere real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and\r\ndaughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a\r\nfortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was\r\nsent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father said\r\nnothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish\r\nTown for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the\r\nstyle of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure\r\nme because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in\r\nparties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very little\r\nprivate conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my\r\npleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to\r\nadmire her and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and\r\nbeing ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no\r\nfolly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the\r\nrashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her\r\nrelatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was\r\nachieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself\r\nwhen I think of that act!\u2014an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never\r\nloved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sure of the\r\nexistence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor\r\nbenevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners\u2014and, I married\r\nher:\u2014gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might\r\nhave\u2014But let me remember to whom I am speaking.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy bride\u2019s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The honeymoon\r\nover, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.\r\nThere was a younger brother, too\u2014a complete dumb idiot. The elder one, whom you\r\nhave seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he\r\nhas some grains of affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued\r\ninterest he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he\r\nonce bore me), will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my\r\nbrother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand\r\npounds, and joined in the plot against me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThese were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I\r\nshould have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her\r\nnature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind\r\ncommon, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher,\r\nexpanded to anything larger\u2014when I found that I could not pass a single\r\nevening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly\r\nconversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I\r\nstarted, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite,\r\nperverse and imbecile\u2014when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or\r\nsettled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her\r\nviolent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,\r\nexacting orders\u2014even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I\r\ncurtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret;\r\nI repressed the deep antipathy I felt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall\r\nexpress what I have to say. I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and\r\nbefore that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed\r\nwith frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so\r\nstrong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty. What a\r\npigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the\r\ncurses those propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an\r\ninfamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which\r\nmust attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my\r\nfather died too. I was rich enough now\u2014yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature\r\nthe most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and\r\ncalled by the law and by society a part of me. And I could not rid myself of it\r\nby any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife\r\nwas mad\u2014her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you\r\ndon\u2019t like my narrative; you look almost sick\u2014shall I defer the rest to another\r\nday?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, finish it now; I pity you\u2014I do earnestly pity you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which\r\none is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that\r\nis the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid,\r\negotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those\r\nwho have endured them. But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling\r\nof which your whole face is full at this moment\u2014with which your eyes are now\r\nalmost overflowing\u2014with which your heart is heaving\u2014with which your hand is\r\ntrembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its\r\nanguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let\r\nthe daughter have free advent\u2014my arms wait to receive her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all\r\nthat intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world, I was\r\ndoubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own\r\nsight\u2014and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and\r\nwrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. Still, society\r\nassociated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily:\r\nsomething of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I\r\nremembered I had once been her husband\u2014that recollection was then, and is now,\r\ninexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never\r\nbe the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior\r\n(her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her age),\r\nshe was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm\r\nin mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne night I had been awakened by her yells\u2014(since the medical men had\r\npronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)\u2014it was a fiery West\r\nIndian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of\r\nthose climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window.\r\nThe air was like sulphur-steams\u2014I could find no refreshment anywhere.\r\nMosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I\r\ncould hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake\u2014black clouds were\r\ncasting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a\r\nhot cannon-ball\u2014she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with\r\nthe ferment of tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and\r\nscene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;\r\nwherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with\r\nsuch language!\u2014no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:\r\nthough two rooms off, I heard every word\u2014the thin partitions of the West India\r\nhouse opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This life,\u2019 said I at last, \u2018is hell: this is the air\u2014those are the sounds of\r\nthe bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. The\r\nsufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now\r\ncumbers my soul. Of the fanatic\u2019s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not\r\na future state worse than this present one\u2014let me break away, and go home to\r\nGod!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI said this whilst I knelt down at and unlocked a trunk which contained a\r\nbrace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only entertained the\r\nintention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and\r\nunalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of\r\nself-destruction, was past in a second.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open\r\ncasement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure.\r\nI then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping\r\norange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and\r\npine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me\u2014I\r\nreasoned thus, Jane\u2014and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in\r\nthat hour, and showed me the right path to follow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and\r\nthe Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and\r\nscorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood\u2014my\r\nbeing longed for renewal\u2014my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope\r\nrevive\u2014and felt regeneration possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of my\r\ngarden I gazed over the sea\u2014bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear\r\nprospects opened thus:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Go,\u2019 said Hope, \u2018and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a\r\nsullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You may take\r\nthe maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions\r\nat Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new\r\ntie you like. That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied\r\nyour name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife,\r\nnor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands,\r\nand you have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity,\r\nher connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart\r\nthem to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her\r\ndegradation with secrecy, and leave her.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother had not made my\r\nmarriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote\r\nto apprise them of the union\u2014having already begun to experience extreme disgust\r\nof its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a\r\nhideous future opening to me\u2014I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and\r\nvery soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was\r\nsuch as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring\r\nto publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster\r\nin the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield, and saw her\r\nsafely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she has\r\nnow for ten years made a wild beast\u2019s den\u2014a goblin\u2019s cell. I had some trouble\r\nin finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose\r\nfidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my\r\nsecret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days\u2014sometimes weeks\u2014which she\r\nfilled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy\r\nRetreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason\u2019s wounds that night he\r\nwas stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my\r\nconfidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could\r\nhave gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a\r\ngood keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears\r\nnothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession, her\r\nvigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. The lunatic is both\r\ncunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her guardian\u2019s\r\ntemporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother,\r\nand twice to possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the\r\nnight-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to\r\nburn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. I thank\r\nProvidence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding\r\napparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days:\r\nbut on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of\r\nthe thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet\r\nvisage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what, sir,\u201d I asked, while he paused, \u201cdid you do when you had settled her\r\nhere? Where did you go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Where did I\r\ngo? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit. I sought the\r\nContinent, and went devious through all its lands. My fixed desire was to seek\r\nand find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the\r\nfury I left at Thornfield\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you could not marry, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not my\r\noriginal intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to tell my tale\r\nplainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely\r\nrational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted\r\nsome woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me,\r\nin spite of the curse with which I was burdened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open your eyes\r\nlike an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if\r\nanswers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the\r\ntablet of one\u2019s heart. But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your \u2018Well,\r\nsir?\u2019 It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has\r\ndrawn me on and on through interminable talk: I don\u2019t very well know why.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u2014What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely! and what do you wish to know now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you; and\r\nwhat she said.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her to\r\nmarry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate. For ten\r\nlong years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes\r\nin St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and\r\nFlorence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I\r\ncould choose my own society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my\r\nideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras,\r\nand German gr\u00e4finnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting\r\nmoment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which\r\nannounced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived. You are\r\nnot to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed\r\nonly for what suited me\u2014for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.\r\nAmongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I\u2014warned as I\r\nwas of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions\u2014would have\r\nasked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation\u2014never\r\ndebauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian Messalina\u2019s attribute:\r\nrooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any\r\nenjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and\r\nI eschewed it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses. The\r\nfirst I chose was C\u00e9line Varens\u2014another of those steps which make a man spurn\r\nhimself when he recalls them. You already know what she was, and how my liaison\r\nwith her terminated. She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a\r\nGerman, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me\r\nin a few weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three\r\nmonths. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not\r\none whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in\r\na good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But, Jane, I see by\r\nyour face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. You\r\nthink me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it not\r\nseem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and\r\nthen another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of\r\nexistence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is the next\r\nworse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by\r\nposition, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading. I now\r\nhate the recollection of the time I passed with C\u00e9line, Giacinta, and Clara.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain inference,\r\nthat if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that had ever been\r\ninstilled into me, as\u2014under any pretext\u2014with any justification\u2014through any\r\ntemptation\u2014to become the successor of these poor girls, he would one day regard\r\nme with the same feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did\r\nnot give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it\r\non my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of\r\ntrial.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jane, why don\u2019t you say \u2018Well, sir?\u2019 I have not done. You are looking\r\ngrave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to the point. Last\r\nJanuary, rid of all mistresses\u2014in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of\r\na useless, roving, lonely life\u2014corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed\r\nagainst all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to\r\nregard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream),\r\nrecalled by business, I came back to England.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred\r\nspot! I expected no peace\u2014no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a\r\nquiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligently as I did the\r\npollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me;\r\nno inward warning that the arbitress of my life\u2014my genius for good or\r\nevil\u2014waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the\r\noccasion of Mesrour\u2019s accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.\r\nChildish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot\r\nand proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not\r\ngo: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort\r\nof authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new\u2014a fresh sap and\r\nsense\u2014stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf must return\r\nto me\u2014that it belonged to my house down below\u2014or I could not have felt it pass\r\naway from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without\r\nsingular regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you\r\nwere not aware that I thought of you or watched for you. The next day I\r\nobserved you\u2014myself unseen\u2014for half-an-hour, while you played with Ad\u00e8le in the\r\ngallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I\r\nwas in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Ad\u00e8le claimed\r\nyour outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere:\r\nbut you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and\r\namused her a long time. When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep\r\nreverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in\r\npassing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to\r\nthe sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day\r\nvisions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye\r\noccasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter,\r\nbilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of\r\nyouth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to\r\nan ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall,\r\nwakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet! There was\r\nmuch sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your\r\nown abstraction. It seemed to say\u2014\u2018My fine visions are all very well, but I\r\nmust not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green\r\nflowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a\r\nrough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.\u2019 You\r\nran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house\r\naccounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed\r\nwith you for getting out of my sight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cImpatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence. An\r\nunusual\u2014to me\u2014a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to\r\nsearch it deeper and know it better. You entered the room with a look and air\r\nat once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed\u2014much as you are now. I\r\nmade you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and\r\nmanner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether\r\nthat of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good\r\ndeal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or\r\nblunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to\r\nyour interlocutor\u2019s face: there was penetration and power in each glance you\r\ngave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very\r\nsoon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy\r\nbetween you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see\r\nhow quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I\r\nwould, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my\r\nmoroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet\r\nsagacious grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with\r\nwhat I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long\r\ntime, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an\r\nintellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this\r\nnovel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a\r\nhaunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade\u2014the\r\nsweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not then know that it was no\r\ntransitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an\r\nindestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I\r\nshunned you\u2014but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own\r\ndesk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as\r\nlittle token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual\r\nexpression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you\r\nwere not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual\r\npleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and\r\nresolved to find this out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance, and\r\ngenial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was\r\nthe silent schoolroom\u2014it was the tedium of your life\u2014that made you mournful. I\r\npermitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion\r\nsoon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name\r\npronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance\r\nmeeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your\r\nmanner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble\u2014a hovering doubt: you did not\r\nknow what my caprice might be\u2014whether I was going to play the master and be\r\nstern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often to\r\nsimulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such\r\nbloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado\r\noften to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk any more of those days, sir,\u201d I interrupted, furtively dashing away\r\nsome tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for I knew what I must\r\ndo\u2014and do soon\u2014and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his\r\nfeelings only made my work more difficult.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Jane,\u201d he returned: \u201cwhat necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when\r\nthe Present is so much surer\u2014the Future so much brighter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see now how the case stands\u2014do you not?\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter a youth and\r\nmanhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have\r\nfor the first time found what I can truly love\u2014I have found you. You are\r\nmy sympathy\u2014my better self\u2014my good angel. I am bound to you with a strong\r\nattachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is\r\nconceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of\r\nlife, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame,\r\nfuses you and me in one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To tell me\r\nthat I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a\r\nhideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a\r\nstubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early instilled prejudice:\r\nI wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I\r\nshould have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do\r\nnow\u2014opened to you plainly my life of agony\u2014described to you my hunger and\r\nthirst after a higher and worthier existence\u2014shown to you, not my\r\nresolution (that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love\r\nfaithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I\r\nshould have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.\r\nJane\u2014give it me now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy are you silent, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals. Terrible\r\nmoment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human being that ever lived\r\ncould wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved me I\r\nabsolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol. One drear word\r\ncomprised my intolerable duty\u2014\u201cDepart!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise\u2014\u2018I will be yours,\r\nMr. Rochester.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I will not be yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnother long silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane!\u201d recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and\r\nturned me stone-cold with ominous terror\u2014for this still voice was the pant of a\r\nlion rising\u2014\u201cJane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go\r\nanother?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane\u201d (bending towards and embracing me), \u201cdo you mean it now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jane, this is bitter! This\u2014this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would to obey you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA wild look raised his brows\u2014crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore\r\nyet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared\u2014but I\r\nresolved.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. All\r\nhappiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For a wife I have but\r\nthe maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder\r\nchurchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some\r\nhope?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again\r\nthere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you will not yield?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?\u201d His voice rose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust for a\r\npassion\u2014vice for an occupation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for\r\nmyself. We were born to strive and endure\u2014you as well as I: do so. You will\r\nforget me before I forget you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I could\r\nnot change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what a distortion\r\nin your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct!\r\nIs it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere\r\nhuman law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives\r\nnor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors\r\nagainst me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. They spoke almost as\r\nloud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. \u201cOh, comply!\u201d it said. \u201cThink of\r\nhis misery; think of his danger\u2014look at his state when left alone; remember his\r\nheadlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair\u2014soothe him;\r\nsave him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world\r\ncares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill indomitable was the reply\u2014\u201cI care for myself. The more solitary,\r\nthe more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\r\nI will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the\r\nprinciples received by me when I was sane, and not mad\u2014as I am now. Laws and\r\nprinciples are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such\r\nmoments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour;\r\nstringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I\r\nmight break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth\u2014so I have always\r\nbelieved; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane\u2014quite\r\ninsane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can\r\ncount its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I\r\nhave at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His fury was\r\nwrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he\r\ncrossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist. He seemed to devour\r\nme with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as\r\nstubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still\r\npossessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul,\r\nfortunately, has an interpreter\u2014often an unconscious, but still a truthful\r\ninterpreter\u2014in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce\r\nface I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed\r\nstrength almost exhausted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d said he, as he ground his teeth, \u201cnever was anything at once so frail\r\nand so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!\u201d (And he shook me with\r\nthe force of his hold.) \u201cI could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what\r\ngood would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye:\r\nconsider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with\r\nmore than courage\u2014with a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot\r\nget at it\u2014the savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight\r\nprison, my outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the\r\nhouse; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself\r\npossessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit\u2014with will and\r\nenergy, and virtue and purity\u2014that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of\r\nyourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you\r\nwould: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence\u2014you\r\nwill vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me. The\r\nlook was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however,\r\nwould have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his\r\nsorrow: I retired to the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are going, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am going, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are leaving me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my\r\nwild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly,\r\n\u201cI am going.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWithdraw, then,\u2014I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up\r\nto your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my\r\nsufferings\u2014think of me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. \u201cOh, Jane! my hope\u2014my\r\nlove\u2014my life!\u201d broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob.\r\n\n\r\nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back\u2014walked back as\r\ndeterminedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his face from\r\nthe cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you, my dear master!\u201d I said. \u201cGod keep you from harm and\r\nwrong\u2014direct you, solace you\u2014reward you well for your past kindness to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle Jane\u2019s love would have been my best reward,\u201d he answered; \u201cwithout it,\r\nmy heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love: yes\u2014nobly, generously.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUp the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he\r\nsprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the\r\nroom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFarewell!\u201d was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added, \u201cFarewell for\r\never!\u201d\r\n\n\n\r\nThat night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay\r\ndown in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt\r\nI lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind\r\nimpressed with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck me into\r\nsyncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and\r\ntremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head\r\nto look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the\r\nmoon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come\u2014watched with\r\nthe strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on\r\nher disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first\r\npenetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white\r\nhuman form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed\r\nand gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet\r\nso near, it whispered in my heart\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy daughter, flee temptation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMother, I will.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night,\r\nbut July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. \u201cIt cannot be too\r\nearly to commence the task I have to fulfil,\u201d thought I. I rose: I was dressed;\r\nfor I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers\r\nsome linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the\r\nbeads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.\r\nI left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride\u2019s who had melted in\r\nair. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty\r\nshillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,\r\npinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet,\r\nand stole from my room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d I whispered, as I glided past her door.\r\n\u201cFarewell, my darling Ad\u00e8le!\u201d I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. No\r\nthought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine\r\near: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\r\n\n\r\nI would have got past Mr. Rochester\u2019s chamber without a pause; but my heart\r\nmomentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop\r\nalso. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall;\r\nand again and again he sighed while I listened. There was a heaven\u2014a temporary\r\nheaven\u2014in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,\u201d and\r\na fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of this.\r\n\n\r\nThat kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day.\r\nHe would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He would have me sought\r\nfor: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would\r\nsuffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards\r\nthe lock: I caught it back, and glided on.\r\n\n\r\nDrearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it\r\nmechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too,\r\na phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water, I\r\ngot some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely\r\nshaken of late, must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened\r\nthe door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great\r\ngates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.\r\nThrough that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\r\n\n\r\nA mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary\r\ndirection to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and\r\nwondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No reflection was to be allowed\r\nnow: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought\r\nwas to be given either to the past or the future. The first was a page so\r\nheavenly sweet\u2014so deadly sad\u2014that to read one line of it would dissolve my\r\ncourage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like\r\nthe world when the deluge was gone by.\r\n\n\r\nI skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it was a\r\nlovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the\r\nhouse, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling\r\nsky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to\r\nthe scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the\r\nblock and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping\r\nat the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering\u2014and oh! with\r\nagony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now\u2014in\r\nhis room\u2014watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay\r\nwith him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too\r\nlate; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I\r\nwas sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter\u2014his pride; his\r\nredeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his\r\nself-abandonment\u2014far worse than my abandonment\u2014how it goaded me! It was a\r\nbarbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it\r\nsickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in. Birds began singing in brake\r\nand copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What\r\nwas I? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I\r\nabhorred myself. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from\r\nself-respect. I had injured\u2014wounded\u2014left my master. I was hateful in my own\r\neyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As\r\nto my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled\r\nthe other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I\r\nwent like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the\r\nlimbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my\r\nface to the wet turf. I had some fear\u2014or hope\u2014that here I should die: but I was\r\nsoon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my\r\nfeet\u2014as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I\r\nsat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and lifted my hand; it\r\nstopped. I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off,\r\nand where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections. I asked for what sum he\r\nwould take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty;\r\nwell, he would try to make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the\r\ninside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its\r\nway.\r\n\n\r\nGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed\r\nsuch stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never\r\nappeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my\r\nlips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what\r\nyou wholly love.\r\n\n"}
{"30": "\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\r\nTwo days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a\r\nplace called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given,\r\nand I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile\r\noff by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take\r\nmy parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety;\r\nthere it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\r\n\n\r\nWhitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where\r\nfour roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and\r\nin darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these\r\npoint is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above\r\ntwenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have\r\nlighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this\r\nI see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of\r\nmountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be\r\nthin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west,\r\nnorth, and south\u2014white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the\r\nheather grows deep and wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might\r\npass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am\r\ndoing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might\r\nbe questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and\r\nexcite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment\u2014not a\r\ncharm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are\u2014none that saw me would\r\nhave a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the universal\r\nmother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.\r\n\n\r\nI struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing\r\nthe brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its\r\nturnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat\r\ndown under it. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head:\r\nthe sky was over that.\r\n\n\r\nSome time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that\r\nwild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me.\r\nIf a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a\r\nbull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions\r\nunfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening\r\ndeclined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only\r\nlistened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\r\n\n\r\nWhat was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do\r\nnothing and go nowhere!\u2014when a long way must yet be measured by my weary,\r\ntrembling limbs before I could reach human habitation\u2014when cold charity must be\r\nentreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost\r\ncertain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my\r\nwants relieved!\r\n\n\r\nI touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day.\r\nI looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm\r\nridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature\r\nseemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I,\r\nwho from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her\r\nwith filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her\r\nchild: my mother would lodge me without money and without price. I had one\r\nmorsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed\r\nthrough at noon with a stray penny\u2014my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming\r\nhere and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them\r\nwith the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by\r\nthis hermit\u2019s meal. I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose\r\nmy couch.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nBeside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in\r\nit; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to\r\ninvade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low,\r\nmossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement\r\nof the night, cold.\r\n\n\r\nMy rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It plained\r\nof its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It trembled for\r\nMr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him\r\nwith ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it\r\nstill quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.\r\n\n\r\nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and\r\nher planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship\r\nof fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence\r\nmost when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in\r\nthe unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we\r\nread clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to\r\nmy knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw\r\nthe mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was\u2014what countless systems there\r\nswept space like a soft trace of light\u2014I felt the might and strength of God.\r\nSure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that\r\nneither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my\r\nprayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr.\r\nRochester was safe: he was God\u2019s, and by God would he be guarded. I again\r\nnestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.\r\n\n\r\nBut next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little birds had\r\nleft their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather\r\nthe heath honey before the dew was dried\u2014when the long morning shadows were\r\ncurtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky\u2014I got up, and I looked round me.\r\n\n\r\nWhat a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor!\r\nEverywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run\r\nover the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the\r\nmoment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment,\r\npermanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and had a human being\u2019s wants:\r\nI must not linger where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back\r\nat the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this\u2014that my Maker\r\nhad that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that\r\nthis weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now\r\nbut to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.\r\nLife, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains,\r\nand responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the\r\nsuffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.\r\n\n\r\nWhitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and\r\nhigh. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice. I walked a long\r\ntime, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously\r\nyield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me\u2014might relax this forced action,\r\nand, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that\r\nclogged heart and limb\u2014I heard a bell chime\u2014a church bell.\r\n\n\r\nI turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills,\r\nwhose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a\r\nspire. All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and\r\ncornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied\r\nshades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny\r\nlea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a\r\nheavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows\r\nand their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on:\r\nstrive to live and bend to toil like the rest.\r\n\n\r\nAbout two o\u2019clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of\r\nits one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.\r\nI coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a\r\ndegree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to\r\nhave some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my\r\nfellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the\r\ncauseway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one\r\nof these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my\r\nthroat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities\r\nof destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would\r\nbe accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.\r\n\n\r\nI entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a\r\nlady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How could she serve me? I\r\nwas seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared. I\r\ndared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I\r\nfelt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I\r\nwas tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to\r\nmy request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep;\r\nbut conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.\r\nSoon I asked her \u201cif there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the\r\nvillage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face with\r\nNecessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend,\r\nwithout a coin. I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere. Where?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay; she couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver\u2019s needle-factory,\r\nand at the foundry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid Mr. Oliver employ women?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay; it was men\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do the women do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI knawn\u2019t,\u201d was the answer. \u201cSome does one thing, and some another. Poor folk\r\nmun get on as they can.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to\r\nimportune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I\r\ntook leave.\r\n\n\r\nI passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand\r\nand to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to\r\nenter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and\r\nreturning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now\r\nfor want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere\r\nmany minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching\r\nsomething\u2014a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at\r\nthe top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly\r\nblooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white door or\r\ntouch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of\r\nthe inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A\r\nmild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such a voice as\r\nmight be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame\u2014a voice wretchedly\r\nlow and faltering\u2014I asked if a servant was wanted here?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said she; \u201cwe do not keep a servant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?\u201d I continued. \u201cI am\r\na stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter\r\nwhat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:\r\nbesides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position,\r\ntale. She shook her head, she \u201cwas sorry she could give me no information,\u201d and\r\nthe white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had\r\nheld it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread;\r\nfor I was now brought low.\r\n\n\r\nI could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect\r\nof aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not\r\nfar off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was\r\nso sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature\u2019s cravings, instinct kept me roaming\r\nround abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no\r\nsolitude\u2014rest no rest\u2014while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in\r\nmy side.\r\n\n\r\nI drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered\r\naway: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask\u2014no right\r\nto expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while\r\nI thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw\r\nthe church spire before me: I hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in\r\nthe middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no\r\ndoubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place\r\nwhere they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the\r\nclergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman\u2019s function to help\u2014at\r\nleast with advice\u2014those who wished to help themselves. I seemed to have\r\nsomething like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and\r\ngathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and\r\nknocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the\r\nparsonage?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas the clergyman in?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould he be in soon?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was gone from home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo a distance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot so far\u2014happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden death of\r\nhis father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a\r\nfortnight longer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas there any lady of the house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;\u201d and of her, reader, I\r\ncould not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not\r\nyet beg; and again I crawled away.\r\n\n\r\nOnce more I took off my handkerchief\u2014once more I thought of the cakes of bread\r\nin the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang\r\nof famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the\r\nshop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I\r\nventured the request\u2014\u201cWould she give me a roll for this handkerchief?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked at me with evident suspicion: \u201cNay, she never sold stuff i\u2019 that\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAlmost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. \u201cHow could she\r\ntell where I had got the handkerchief?\u201d she said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould she take my gloves?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! what could she do with them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is\r\nenjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can\r\nscarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation,\r\nblent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to\r\nbe willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was\r\nwhat was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is\r\nfrequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be\r\nsure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me\r\nwith employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first\r\ntime, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would\r\nnot take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the\r\noffer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense\r\nnow. I am sick of the subject.\r\n\n\r\nA little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the\r\nfarmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I stopped and said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.\u201d He cast on me a\r\nglance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from his loaf,\r\nand gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an\r\neccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I\r\nwas out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.\r\n\n\r\nI could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I\r\nhave before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground\r\nwas damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I\r\nhad again and again to change my quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity\r\nbefriended me. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was\r\nwet. Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I\r\nsought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food\r\npass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a\r\nmess of cold porridge into a pig trough. \u201cWill you give me that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nShe stared at me. \u201cMother!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cthere is a woman wants me to give\r\nher these porridge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell lass,\u201d replied a voice within, \u201cgive it her if she\u2019s a beggar. T\u2019 pig\r\ndoesn\u2019t want it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it\r\nravenously.\r\n\n\r\nAs the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had\r\nbeen pursuing an hour or more.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy strength is quite failing me,\u201d I said in a soliloquy. \u201cI feel I cannot go\r\nmuch farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the rain descends\r\nso, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do\r\notherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this\r\nfeeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation\u2014this total\r\nprostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.\r\nAnd why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle\r\nto retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is\r\nliving: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot\r\nsubmit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!\u2014direct me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed\r\nfar from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation\r\nsurrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more\r\ndrawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild\r\nand unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay\r\nbetween me and the dusky hill.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,\u201d I\r\nreflected. \u201cAnd far better that crows and ravens\u2014if any ravens there be in\r\nthese regions\u2014should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be\r\nprisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find a\r\nhollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all\r\nthe surface of the waste looked level. It showed no variation but of tint:\r\ngreen, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore\r\nonly heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but\r\nas mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the\r\ndaylight.\r\n\n\r\nMy eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing\r\namidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and\r\nthe ridges, a light sprang up. \u201cThat is an ignis fatuus,\u201d was my first\r\nthought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on, however, quite\r\nsteadily, neither receding nor advancing. \u201cIs it, then, a bonfire just\r\nkindled?\u201d I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it\r\ndid not diminish, so it did not enlarge. \u201cIt may be a candle in a house,\u201d I\r\nthen conjectured; \u201cbut if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away:\r\nand were it within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the\r\ndoor to have it shut in my face.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I lay still\r\na while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in\r\nthe distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I but\r\nhave stiffened to the still frost\u2014the friendly numbness of death\u2014it might have\r\npelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its\r\nchilling influence. I rose ere long.\r\n\n\r\nThe light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to\r\nwalk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It led me aslant\r\nover the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter,\r\nand was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell\r\ntwice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn\r\nhope: I must gain it.\r\n\n\r\nHaving crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached\r\nit; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed\r\nfrom a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees\u2014firs, apparently, from what I\r\ncould distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the\r\ngloom. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me\r\nand it. I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the\r\nrough stones of a low wall\u2014above it, something like palisades, and within, a\r\nhigh and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me:\r\nit was a gate\u2014a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On each side\r\nstood a sable bush\u2014holly or yew.\r\n\n\r\nEntering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to\r\nview, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was\r\nobscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking\r\nthe door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the\r\nlozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground,\r\nmade still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose\r\nleaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.\r\nThe aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been\r\ndeemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage\r\nshooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a\r\nsanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in\r\nrows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a\r\nclock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my\r\nbeacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat\r\nrough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a\r\nstocking.\r\n\n\r\nI noticed these objects cursorily only\u2014in them there was nothing extraordinary.\r\nA group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the\r\nrosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young, graceful women\u2014ladies in every\r\npoint\u2014sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore\r\ndeep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very\r\nfair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the\r\nknee of one girl\u2014in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\r\n\n\r\nA strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were they? They\r\ncould not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked\r\nlike a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen\r\nsuch faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every\r\nlineament. I cannot call them handsome\u2014they were too pale and grave for the\r\nword: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.\r\nA stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\r\nthey frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books\r\nthey held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in\r\nthe task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had\r\nbeen shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could\r\nhear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and\r\nI even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman\u2019s\r\nknitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last,\r\nit was audible enough to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cListen, Diana,\u201d said one of the absorbed students; \u201cFranz and old Daniel are\r\ntogether in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has\r\nawakened in terror\u2014listen!\u201d And in a low voice she read something, of which not\r\none word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue\u2014neither French\r\nnor Latin. Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is strong,\u201d she said, when she had finished: \u201cI relish it.\u201d The other\r\ngirl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she\r\ngazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the\r\nlanguage and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I\r\nfirst heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me\u2014conveying no\r\nmeaning:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.\u2019 Good! good!\u201d she\r\nexclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. \u201cThere you have a dim and\r\nmighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a hundred pages of\r\nfustian. \u2018Ich w\u00e4ge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke\r\nmit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.\u2019 I like it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBoth were again silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there ony country where they talk i\u2019 that way?\u201d asked the old woman,\r\nlooking up from her knitting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Hannah\u2014a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, for sure case, I knawn\u2019t how they can understand t\u2019 one t\u2019other: and if\r\neither o\u2019 ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe could probably tell something of what they said, but not all\u2014for we are not\r\nas clever as you think us, Hannah. We don\u2019t speak German, and we cannot read it\r\nwithout a dictionary to help us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what good does it do you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe mean to teach it some time\u2014or at least the elements, as they say; and then\r\nwe shall get more money than we do now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVarry like: but give ower studying; ye\u2019ve done enough for to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think we have: at least I\u2019m tired. Mary, are you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMortally: after all, it\u2019s tough work fagging away at a language with no master\r\nbut a lexicon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I\r\nwonder when St. John will come home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch\r\nshe drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to\r\nlook at the fire in the parlour?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I\r\nheard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, childer!\u201d said she, \u201cit fair troubles me to go into yond\u2019 room now: it\r\nlooks so lonesome wi\u2019 the chair empty and set back in a corner.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he is in a better place,\u201d continued Hannah: \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t wish him here\r\nagain. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou say he never mentioned us?\u201d inquired one of the ladies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He had been a\r\nbit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John\r\nasked if he would like either o\u2019 ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him. He\r\nbegan again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day\u2014that is, a\r\nfortnight sin\u2019\u2014and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a\u2019most stark when\r\nyour brother went into t\u2019 chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that\u2019s t\u2019 last o\u2019\r\nt\u2019 old stock\u2014for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them \u2019at\u2019s\r\ngone; for all your mother wor mich i\u2019 your way, and a\u2019most as book-learned. She\r\nwor the pictur\u2019 o\u2019 ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I\r\nnow concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair complexioned and\r\nslenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence. One,\r\nto be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference\r\nin their style of wearing it; Mary\u2019s pale brown locks were parted and braided\r\nsmooth: Diana\u2019s duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock\r\nstruck ten.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2019ll want your supper, I am sure,\u201d observed Hannah; \u201cand so will Mr. St. John\r\nwhen he comes in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to\r\nwithdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching\r\nthem, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest,\r\nI had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More\r\ndesolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible\r\ndid it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to\r\nmake them believe in the truth of my wants and woes\u2014to induce them to vouchsafe\r\na rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it\r\nhesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah opened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed me by\r\nthe light of the candle she held.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay I speak to your mistresses?\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come from?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your business here at this hour?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want a night\u2019s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to\r\neat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDistrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll give you\r\na piece of bread,\u201d she said, after a pause; \u201cbut we can\u2019t take in a vagrant to\r\nlodge. It isn\u2019t likely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo let me speak to your mistresses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about now; it\r\nlooks very ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don\u2019t do wrong,\r\nthat\u2019s all. Here is a penny; now go\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don\u2019t shut the\r\ndoor:\u2014oh, don\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must; the rain is driving in\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell the young ladies. Let me see them\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn\u2019t make\r\nsuch a noise. Move off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I must die if I am turned away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot you. I\u2019m fear\u2019d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk\u2019s\r\nhouses at this time o\u2019 night. If you\u2019ve any followers\u2014housebreakers or such\r\nlike\u2014anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we\r\nhave a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.\u201d Here the honest but inflexible servant\r\nclapped the door to and bolted it within.\r\n\n\r\nThis was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering\u2014a throe of true despair\u2014rent\r\nand heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I\r\nsank on the wet doorstep: I groaned\u2014I wrung my hands\u2014I wept in utter anguish.\r\nOh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror!\r\nAlas, this isolation\u2014this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope,\r\nbut the footing of fortitude was gone\u2014at least for a moment; but the last I\r\nsoon endeavoured to regain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can but die,\u201d I said, \u201cand I believe in God. Let me try to wait His will in\r\nsilence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThese words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery\r\ninto my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there\u2014dumb and still.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll men must die,\u201d said a voice quite close at hand; \u201cbut all are not\r\ncondemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you\r\nperished here of want.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho or what speaks?\u201d I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable\r\nnow of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near\u2014what form,\r\nthe pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing.\r\nWith a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it you, Mr. St. John?\u201d cried Hannah.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014yes; open quickly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in\u2014your\r\nsisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about.\r\nThere has been a beggar-woman\u2014I declare she is not gone yet!\u2014laid down there.\r\nGet up! for shame! Move off, I say!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in\r\nexcluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and listened to\r\nboth you and her. I think this is a peculiar case\u2014I must at least examine into\r\nit. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWith difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean, bright\r\nkitchen\u2014on the very hearth\u2014trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the\r\nlast degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother,\r\nMr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John, who is it?\u201d I heard one ask.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell: I found her at the door,\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe does look white,\u201d said Hannah.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs white as clay or death,\u201d was responded. \u201cShe will fall: let her sit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still possessed\r\nmy senses, though just now I could not speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she is worn\r\nto nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA mere spectre!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she ill, or only famished?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFamished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of bread.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the\r\nfire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my\r\nlips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy\r\nin her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion\r\nspoke: \u201cTry to eat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014try,\u201d repeated Mary gently; and Mary\u2019s hand removed my sodden bonnet and\r\nlifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot too much at first\u2014restrain her,\u201d said the brother; \u201cshe has had enough.\u201d\r\nAnd he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little more, St. John\u2014look at the avidity in her eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now\u2014ask her her name.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt I could speak, and I answered\u2014\u201cMy name is Jane Elliott.\u201d Anxious as ever\r\nto avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an alias.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where do you live? Where are your friends?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan we send for any one you know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat account can you give of yourself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSomehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was\r\nbrought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and\r\ndisowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the mendicant\u2014to resume my\r\nnatural manner and character. I began once more to know myself; and when Mr.\r\nSt. John demanded an account\u2014which at present I was far too weak to render\u2014I\r\nsaid after a brief pause\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I can give you no details to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what, then,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you expect me to do for you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took\r\nthe word\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat we have now given you what aid you require? and\r\nthat we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both\r\nwith power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her compassionate\r\ngaze with a smile, I said\u2014\u201cI will trust you. If I were a masterless and stray\r\ndog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I\r\nreally have no fear. Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much\r\ndiscourse\u2014my breath is short\u2014I feel a spasm when I speak.\u201d All three surveyed\r\nme, and all three were silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHannah,\u201d said Mr. St. John, at last, \u201clet her sit there at present, and ask\r\nher no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and\r\nbread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned\u2014I could not tell which. A\r\nkind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire. In an\r\nundertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant\u2019s aid,\r\nI contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a\r\nwarm, dry bed received me. I thanked God\u2014experienced amidst unutterable\r\nexhaustion a glow of grateful joy\u2014and slept.\r\n\n"}
{"31": "\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\r\nThe recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in\r\nmy mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts\r\nframed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow\r\nbed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and\r\nto have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of\r\nthe lapse of time\u2014of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I\r\nobserved when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they\r\nwere; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I\r\ncould not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.\r\nHannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I\r\nhad a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my\r\ncircumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in\r\nthe chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at\r\nmy bedside\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is very well we took her in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had\r\nshe been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone through?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStrange hardships, I imagine\u2014poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking;\r\nher accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and\r\nwet, were little worn and fine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and\r\nwhen in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be\r\nagreeable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNever once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the\r\nhospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,\r\nmyself. I was comforted.\r\n\n\r\nMr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was\r\nthe result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. He pronounced it\r\nneedless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to\r\nherself. He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole\r\nsystem must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery\r\nwould be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few\r\nwords, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man\r\nlittle accustomed to expansive comment, \u201cRather an unusual physiognomy;\r\ncertainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFar otherwise,\u201d responded Diana. \u201cTo speak truth, St. John, my heart rather\r\nwarms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit her\r\npermanently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is hardly likely,\u201d was the reply. \u201cYou will find she is some young lady\r\nwho has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously\r\nleft them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not\r\nobstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of\r\nher tractability.\u201d He stood considering me some minutes; then added, \u201cShe looks\r\nsensible, but not at all handsome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is so ill, St. John.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIll or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are\r\nquite wanting in those features.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed,\r\nand turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed,\r\nthe dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the food was good\u2014void of the\r\nfeverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When she\r\nleft me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose\r\nand desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put on?\r\nOnly my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen\r\nin the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was\r\nspared the humiliation.\r\n\n\r\nOn a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk\r\nfrock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from it; the\r\ncreases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent. My very shoes and\r\nstockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of\r\nwashing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary\r\nprocess, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My\r\nclothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies\r\nwith a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking\u2014no speck of the\r\ndirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me,\r\nleft\u2014I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow\r\nlow passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.\r\n\n\r\nIt was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire.\r\nHannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to\r\neradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by\r\neducation: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold\r\nand stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and\r\nwhen she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat, you have got up!\u201d she said. \u201cYou are better, then. You may sit you down\r\nin my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, examining me\r\nevery now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to me, as she took some\r\nloaves from the oven, she asked bluntly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever go a-begging afore you came here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the\r\nquestion, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered\r\nquietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than\r\nyourself or your young ladies.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAfter a pause she said, \u201cI dunnut understand that: you\u2019ve like no house, nor no\r\nbrass, I guess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a\r\nbeggar in your sense of the word.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you book-learned?\u201d she inquired presently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, very.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never been to a boarding-school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was at a boarding-school eight years.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe opened her eyes wide. \u201cWhatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are you going\r\nto do with these gooseberries?\u201d I inquired, as she brought out a basket of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMak\u2019 \u2019em into pies.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive them to me and I\u2019ll pick them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I must do something. Let me have them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress,\r\n\u201clest,\u201d as she said, \u201cI should mucky it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2019ve not been used to sarvant\u2019s wark, I see by your hands,\u201d she remarked.\r\n\u201cHappen ye\u2019ve been a dressmaker?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don\u2019t trouble your\r\nhead further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay; he doesn\u2019t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at home, he\r\nis in his own parish at Morton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat village a few miles off?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what is he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is a parson.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had\r\nasked to see the clergyman. \u201cThis, then, was his father\u2019s residence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt\r\n(great) grandfather afore him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye; St. John is like his kirstened name.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTheir father is dead?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDead three weeks sin\u2019 of a stroke.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have no mother?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe mistress has been dead this mony a year.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you lived with the family long?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will say so\r\nmuch for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe again regarded me with a surprised stare. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said, \u201cI was\r\nquite mista\u2019en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about,\r\nyou mun forgie me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd though,\u201d I continued, rather severely, \u201cyou wished to turn me from the\r\ndoor, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o\u2019 th\u2019 childer nor\r\nof mysel: poor things! They\u2019ve like nobody to tak\u2019 care on \u2019em but me. I\u2019m like\r\nto look sharpish.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI maintained a grave silence for some minutes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou munnut think too hardly of me,\u201d she again remarked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I do think hardly of you,\u201d I said; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you why\u2014not so much\r\nbecause you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as\r\nbecause you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no \u2018brass\u2019 and no\r\nhouse. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am;\r\nand if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo more I ought,\u201d said she: \u201cMr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor\r\nwrang\u2014but I\u2019ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a\r\nraight down dacent little crater.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do\u2014I forgive you now. Shake hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile\r\nillumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.\r\n\n\r\nHannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she made\r\nthe paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her\r\ndeceased master and mistress, and \u201cthe childer,\u201d as she called the young\r\npeople.\r\n\n\r\nOld Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as\r\nancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever\r\nsince it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, \u201caboon two hundred year old\u2014for\r\nall it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi\u2019 Mr. Oliver\u2019s\r\ngrand hall down i\u2019 Morton Vale. But she could remember Bill Oliver\u2019s father a\r\njourneyman needlemaker; and th\u2019 Rivers wor gentry i\u2019 th\u2019 owd days o\u2019 th\u2019\r\nHenrys, as onybody might see by looking into th\u2019 registers i\u2019 Morton Church\r\nvestry.\u201d Still, she allowed, \u201cthe owd maister was like other folk\u2014naught mich\r\nout o\u2019 t\u2019 common way: stark mad o\u2019 shooting, and farming, and sich like.\u201d The\r\nmistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the\r\n\u201cbairns\u201d had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor\r\never had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they\r\ncould speak; and they had always been \u201cof a mak\u2019 of their own.\u201d Mr. St. John,\r\nwhen he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as\r\nthey left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their\r\nfather had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted\r\nturning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they\r\nmust provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long\r\nwhile, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father\u2019s\r\ndeath; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills\r\nabout. They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always\r\nsaid there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each\r\nother\u2014never fell out nor \u201cthreaped.\u201d She did not know where there was such a\r\nfamily for being united.\r\n\n\r\nHaving finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and\r\ntheir brother were now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to\r\ntea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the\r\nkitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed through;\r\nthe two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the\r\npleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took\r\nmy hand: she shook her head at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou should have waited for my leave to descend,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still look\r\nvery pale\u2014and so thin! Poor child!\u2014poor girl!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She possessed\r\neyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of\r\ncharm. Mary\u2019s countenance was equally intelligent\u2014her features equally pretty;\r\nbut her expression was more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more\r\ndistant. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will,\r\nevidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority\r\nsupported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect\r\npermitted, to an active will.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what business have you here?\u201d she continued. \u201cIt is not your place. Mary\r\nand I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to\r\nlicense\u2014but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am very well here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBesides, the fire is too hot for you,\u201d interposed Mary.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d added her sister. \u201cCome, you must be obedient.\u201d And still holding\r\nmy hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit there,\u201d she said, placing me on the sofa, \u201cwhile we take our things off\r\nand get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little\r\nmoorland home\u2014to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah\r\nis baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a\r\nbook or newspaper in his hand. I examined, first, the parlour, and then its\r\noccupant.\r\n\n\r\nThe parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable,\r\nbecause clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the\r\nwalnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of\r\nthe men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with\r\nglass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no\r\nsuperfluous ornament in the room\u2014not one modern piece of furniture, save a\r\nbrace of workboxes and a lady\u2019s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\r\neverything\u2014including the carpet and curtains\u2014looked at once well worn and well\r\nsaved.\r\n\n\r\nMr. St. John\u2014sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,\r\nkeeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed\u2014was\r\neasy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not\r\nhave been easier. He was young\u2014perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty\u2014tall,\r\nslender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in\r\noutline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It\r\nis seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.\r\nHe might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own\r\nbeing so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high\r\nforehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of\r\nfair hair.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it describes\r\nscarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible,\r\nor even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about\r\nhis nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements\r\nwithin either restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor\r\neven direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed\r\nin and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on\r\nthe top of the oven.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEat that now,\u201d she said: \u201cyou must be hungry. Hannah says you have had nothing\r\nbut some gruel since breakfast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers now\r\nclosed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue\r\npictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an unceremonious directness, a\r\nsearching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which told that intention,\r\nand not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are very hungry,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am, sir.\u201d It is my way\u2014it always was my way, by instinct\u2014ever to meet the\r\nbrief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last\r\nthree days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your\r\nappetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,\u201d was my very\r\nclumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said coolly: \u201cwhen you have indicated to us the residence of your\r\nfriends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely\r\nwithout home and friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in\r\ntheir glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak particularly of the young\r\nladies. St. John\u2019s eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a\r\nfigurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to use them rather as\r\ninstruments to search other people\u2019s thoughts, than as agents to reveal his\r\nown: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more\r\ncalculated to embarrass than to encourage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat you are completely isolated from every\r\nconnection?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to\r\nadmittance under any roof in England.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA most singular position at your age!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table\r\nbefore me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon explained the quest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have never been married? You are a spinster?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiana laughed. \u201cWhy, she can\u2019t be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St.\r\nJohn,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections\r\nwere awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and\r\nthe emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to\r\nmy crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till\r\nthe trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you last reside?\u201d he now asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are too inquisitive, St. John,\u201d murmured Mary in a low voice; but he\r\nleaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing\r\nlook.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my\r\nsecret,\u201d I replied concisely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St.\r\nJohn and every other questioner,\u201d remarked Diana.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cAnd you need help, do you not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put\r\nme in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which\r\nwill keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to\r\nthe utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell me what you\r\nhave been accustomed to do, and what you can do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much\r\nso as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me\r\nto address this penetrating young judge steadily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rivers,\u201d I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at me,\r\nopenly and without diffidence, \u201cyou and your sisters have done me a great\r\nservice\u2014the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your\r\nnoble hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited\r\nclaim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I\r\nwill tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I\r\ncan tell without compromising my own peace of mind\u2014my own security, moral and\r\nphysical, and that of others.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could\r\nknow them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable institution.\r\nI will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as\r\na pupil, and two as a teacher\u2014Lowood Orphan Asylum, \u2014\u2014shire: you will have\r\nheard of it, Mr. Rivers?\u2014the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I obtained a\r\ngood situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days\r\nbefore I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to\r\nexplain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame\r\nattached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three.\r\nMiserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from\r\na house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed\r\nbut two points in planning my departure\u2014speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had\r\nto leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my\r\nhurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to\r\nWhitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two\r\nnights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a\r\nthreshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when\r\nbrought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you,\r\nMr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the\r\nshelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since\u2014for I have\r\nnot been insensible during my seeming torpor\u2014and I owe to their spontaneous,\r\ngenuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make her talk any more now, St. John,\u201d said Diana, as I paused; \u201cshe is\r\nevidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss\r\nElliott.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias: I had forgotten\r\nmy new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said your name was Jane Elliott?\u201d he observed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at\r\npresent, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour real name you will not give?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to\r\nit, I avoid.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite right, I am sure,\u201d said Diana. \u201cNow do, brother, let her be at\r\npeace a while.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and\r\nwith as much acumen as ever.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality\u2014you would wish, I\r\nsee, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters\u2019 compassion, and, above all,\r\nwith my charity (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I\r\nresent it\u2014it is just): you desire to be independent of us?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that\r\nis all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till\r\nthen, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless\r\ndestitution.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed you shall stay here,\u201d said Diana, putting her white hand on my\r\nhead. \u201cYou shall,\u201d repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative\r\nsincerity which seemed natural to her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,\u201d said Mr. St. John, \u201cas\r\nthey would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird some\r\nwintry wind might have driven through their casement. I feel more\r\ninclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to\r\ndo so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor\r\ncountry parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to\r\ndespise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as\r\nI can offer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can\r\ndo,\u201d answered Diana for me; \u201cand you know, St. John, she has no choice of\r\nhelpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a\r\nnurse-girl, if I can be no better,\u201d I answered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. \u201cIf such is your spirit, I promise to\r\naid you, in my own time and way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea. I soon\r\nwithdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength\r\nwould permit.\r\n\n"}
{"32": "\nCHAPTER XXX\n\r\nThe more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them. In a few\r\ndays I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out\r\nsometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse\r\nwith them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow\r\nme. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by\r\nme for the first time\u2014the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes,\r\nsentiments, and principles.\r\n\n\r\nI liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what\r\nthey approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the\r\ngrey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its\r\nmouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs\u2014all grown aslant under the stress of\r\nmountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly\u2014and where no flowers but of\r\nthe hardiest species would bloom\u2014found a charm both potent and permanent. They\r\nclung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling\u2014to the hollow vale\r\ninto which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which\r\nwound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little\r\npasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to\r\na flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:\u2014they clung\r\nto this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could\r\ncomprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the\r\nfascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye\r\nfeasted on the outline of swell and sweep\u2014on the wild colouring communicated to\r\nridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant\r\nbracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were\r\nto them\u2014so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the\r\nsoft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;\r\nthe moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the\r\nsame attraction as for them\u2014wound round my faculties the same spell that\r\nentranced theirs.\r\n\n\r\nIndoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and better\r\nread than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they\r\nhad trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full\r\nsatisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the\r\nday. Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short,\r\nperfectly.\r\n\n\r\nIf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana. Physically, she\r\nfar excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In her animal spirits\r\nthere was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my\r\nwonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I could talk a while when the\r\nevening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain\r\nto sit on a stool at Diana\u2019s feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen\r\nalternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I\r\nhad but touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I\r\nsaw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased\r\nand suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection\u2014of the\r\nstrongest kind\u2014was the result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and\r\ncolour-boxes were immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one\r\npoint than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by\r\nthe hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent,\r\nassiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed\r\nlike hours, and weeks like days.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly\r\nbetween me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of the distance\r\nyet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home: a large\r\nproportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the\r\nscattered population of his parish.\r\n\n\r\nNo weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he\r\nwould, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed\r\nby his father\u2019s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty\u2014I\r\nscarcely know in which light he regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very\r\nunfavourable, his sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar\r\nsmile, more solemn than cheerful\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these\r\neasy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to\r\nmyself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiana and Mary\u2019s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes\r\nof apparently mournful meditation.\r\n\n\r\nBut besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with\r\nhim: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature.\r\nZealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet\r\ndid not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should\r\nbe the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often,\r\nof an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he\r\nwould cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself\r\nup to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting\r\nmight be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.\r\n\n\r\nI think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was\r\nto his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense\r\nof the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and\r\nhoary walls he called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in\r\nthe tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem\r\nto roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence\u2014never seek out or\r\ndwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.\r\n\n\r\nIncommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of\r\ngauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in\r\nhis own church at Morton. I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past\r\nmy power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.\r\n\n\r\nIt began calm\u2014and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was\r\ncalm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon\r\nin the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language. This grew to\r\nforce\u2014compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind\r\nastonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout\r\nthere was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern\r\nallusions to Calvinistic doctrines\u2014election, predestination, reprobation\u2014were\r\nfrequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced\r\nfor doom. When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened\r\nby his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me\u2014I\r\nknow not whether equally so to others\u2014that the eloquence to which I had been\r\nlistening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of\r\ndisappointment\u2014where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and\r\ndisquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers\u2014pure-lived, conscientious,\r\nzealous as he was\u2014had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all\r\nunderstanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed\r\nand racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium\u2014regrets to which I have\r\nlatterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me\r\nruthlessly.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and\r\nreturn to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses\r\nin a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in\r\nfamilies by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble\r\ndependents, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and\r\nappreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill\r\nof their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said\r\nnothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it\r\nbecame urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning, being\r\nleft alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the\r\nwindow-recess\u2014which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of\r\nstudy\u2014and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to\r\nframe my inquiry\u2014for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve\r\nglassing over such natures as his\u2014when he saved me the trouble by being the\r\nfirst to commence a dialogue.\r\n\n\r\nLooking up as I drew near\u2014\u201cYou have a question to ask of me?\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself\r\nto undertake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both\r\nuseful and happy here\u2014as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and\r\nyour society gave them unusual pleasure\u2014I deemed it inexpedient to break in on\r\nyour mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should\r\nrender yours necessary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd they will go in three days now?\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will\r\naccompany me; and this old house will be shut up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first\r\nbroached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look\r\ndenoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to recall him to a\r\ntheme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay will not\r\nhave increased the difficulty of securing it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to\r\naccept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew impatient: a\r\nrestless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his\r\nface, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and\r\nwith less trouble.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need be in no hurry to hear,\u201d he said: \u201clet me frankly tell you, I have\r\nnothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, if you\r\nplease, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind\r\nman would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my\r\nfather\u2019s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling\r\ngrange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the\r\nyew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but\r\nof the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent\u2019s crust among\r\nstrangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country\u2014not\r\nonly for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself\r\nhonoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation\r\nfrom fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that\r\nchurch-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,\r\n\u2018Rise, follow Me!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSt. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep\r\nvoice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance. He\r\nresumed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of\r\npoverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading\u2014for I see now\r\nyour habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the\r\nideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I\r\nconsider that no service degrades which can better our race. I hold that the\r\nmore arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer\u2019s task of\r\ntillage is appointed him\u2014the scantier the meed his toil brings\u2014the higher the\r\nhonour. His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the\r\nfirst pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles\u2014their captain was Jesus, the\r\nRedeemer, Himself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I said, as he again paused\u2014\u201cproceed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my\r\nface, as if its features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions\r\ndrawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you will accept the post I offer you,\u201d said he, \u201cand hold it for a\r\nwhile: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the\r\nnarrow and narrowing\u2014the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent;\r\nfor in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though\r\nof a different kind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo explain,\u201d I urged, when he halted once more.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,\u2014how trivial\u2014how cramping.\r\nI shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my\r\nown master. I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month;\r\nbut while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.\r\nMorton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the\r\npoor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I\r\nmean now to open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the\r\npurpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress\u2019s house.\r\nHer salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very\r\nsimply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only\r\ndaughter of the sole rich man in my parish\u2014Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a\r\nneedle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the\r\neducation and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she\r\nshall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and\r\nthe school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to\r\ndischarge in person. Will you be this mistress?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an indignant, or\r\nat least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and\r\nfeelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in what light the lot would\r\nappear to me. In truth it was humble\u2014but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a\r\nsafe asylum: it was plodding\u2014but then, compared with that of a governess in a\r\nrich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers\r\nentered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble\u2014not unworthy\u2014not mentally\r\ndegrading, I made my decision.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you comprehend me?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a village school: your scholars will\r\nbe only poor girls\u2014cottagers\u2019 children\u2014at the best, farmers\u2019 daughters.\r\nKnitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to\r\nteach. What will you do with your accomplishments? What, with the largest\r\nportion of your mind\u2014sentiments\u2014tastes?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSave them till they are wanted. They will keep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know what you undertake, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply\r\ngratified.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will you commence the exercise of your function?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well: so be it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at me. He\r\nshook his head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not stay at Morton long: no, no!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? What is your reason for saying so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the\r\nmaintenance of an even tenor in life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not ambitious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe started at the word \u201cambitious.\u201d He repeated, \u201cNo. What made you think of\r\nambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find it out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was speaking of myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, if you are not ambitious, you are\u2014\u201d He paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the\r\nword, and been displeased. I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a\r\nmost powerful hold on you. I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your\r\nleisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour\r\nwholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content,\u201d he added, with\r\nemphasis, \u201cto live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains\u2014my nature,\r\nthat God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed\u2014made\r\nuseless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached contentment with\r\na humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater in God\u2019s service\u2014I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my\r\nrestlessness. Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some\r\nmeans.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole\r\nprevious month: yet still he puzzled me.\r\n\n\r\nDiana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for\r\nleaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as usual; but\r\nthe sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely\r\nconquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting\r\nfrom any they had ever yet known. It would probably, as far as St. John was\r\nconcerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,\u201d she said: \u201cnatural\r\naffection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he\r\nhides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some things he\r\nis inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly\r\npermit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a\r\nmoment blame him for it. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my\r\nheart!\u201d And the tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her\r\nwork.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,\u201d she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\n\r\nAt that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate\r\npurposely to prove the truth of the adage, that \u201cmisfortunes never come\r\nsingly,\u201d and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the\r\ncup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a letter. He entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOur uncle John is dead,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\nBoth the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared\r\nin their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDead?\u201d repeated Diana.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe riveted a searching gaze on her brother\u2019s face. \u201cAnd what then?\u201d she\r\ndemanded, in a low voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat then, Die?\u201d he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature. \u201cWhat\r\nthen? Why\u2014nothing. Read.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to Mary.\r\nMary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All three looked at\r\neach other, and all three smiled\u2014a dreary, pensive smile enough.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAmen! We can yet live,\u201d said Diana at last.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,\u201d remarked Mary.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might have\r\nbeen,\u201d said Mr. Rivers, \u201cand contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what\r\nis.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.\r\n\n\r\nFor some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,\u201d she said, \u201cand think us\r\nhard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as\r\nan uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was my mother\u2019s brother.\r\nMy father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by his advice that my father\r\nrisked most of his property in the speculation that ruined him. Mutual\r\nrecrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never\r\nreconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it\r\nappears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married,\r\nand had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely\r\nrelated than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for\r\nhis error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has\r\nbequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty\r\nguineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the\r\npurchase of three mourning rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he\r\npleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such\r\nnews. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds\r\neach; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it\r\nwould have enabled him to do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made\r\nto it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day I left Marsh End for\r\nMorton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B\u2014\u2014. In a week,\r\nMr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\n"}
{"33": "\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\r\nMy home, then, when I at last find a home,\u2014is a cottage; a little room with\r\nwhitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a\r\ntable, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of\r\ntea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen,\r\nwith a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled\r\nwith my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends\r\nhas increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.\r\n\n\r\nIt is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan\r\nwho serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth. This morning,\r\nthe village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But three of the number can\r\nread: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a few sew a little. They speak\r\nwith the broadest accent of the district. At present, they and I have a\r\ndifficulty in understanding each other\u2019s language. Some of them are unmannered,\r\nrough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to\r\nlearn, and evince a disposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these\r\ncoarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of\r\ngentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,\r\nintelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those\r\nof the best-born. My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find\r\nsome happiness in discharging that office. Much enjoyment I do not expect in\r\nthe life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and\r\nexert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.\r\n\n\r\nWas I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare,\r\nhumble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to deceive myself, I must\r\nreply\u2014No: I felt desolate to a degree. I felt\u2014yes, idiot that I am\u2014I felt\r\ndegraded. I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the\r\nscale of social existence. I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty,\r\nthe coarseness of all I heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise\r\nmyself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong\u2014that is a great\r\nstep gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I shall get\r\nthe better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite\r\nsubdued. In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and\r\na change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for\r\ndisgust.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, let me ask myself one question\u2014Which is better?\u2014To have surrendered\r\nto temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort\u2014no struggle;\u2014but to\r\nhave sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it;\r\nwakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have\r\nbeen now living in France, Mr. Rochester\u2019s mistress; delirious with his love\r\nhalf my time\u2014for he would\u2014oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He\r\ndid love me\u2014no one will ever love me so again. I shall never more know\r\nthe sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace\u2014for never to any one else\r\nshall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and proud of me\u2014it is what no\r\nman besides will ever be.\u2014But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and\r\nabove all, feeling? Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool\u2019s\r\nparadise at Marseilles\u2014fevered with delusive bliss one hour\u2014suffocating with\r\nthe bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next\u2014or to be a\r\nvillage-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the\r\nhealthy heart of England?\r\n\n\r\nYes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and\r\nscorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed me\r\nto a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!\r\n\n\r\nHaving brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and\r\nlooked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my\r\ncottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The\r\nbirds were singing their last strains\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe air was mild, the dew was balm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere\r\nlong weeping\u2014and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my\r\nmaster: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal\r\nfury\u2014consequences of my departure\u2014which might now, perhaps, be dragging him\r\nfrom the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.\r\nAt this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely\r\nvale of Morton\u2014I say lonely, for in that bend of it visible to me there\r\nwas no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees,\r\nand, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver\r\nand his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone\r\nframe of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny\r\ngarden from the meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog\u2014old Carlo, Mr. Rivers\u2019\r\npointer, as I saw in a moment\u2014was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John\r\nhimself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost\r\nto displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for\r\nyou. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I thought,\r\nwith austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible\r\nupon it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you found your first day\u2019s work harder than you expected?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps your accommodations\u2014your cottage\u2014your furniture\u2014have disappointed\r\nyour expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough; but\u2014\u201d I interrupted\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.\r\nAll I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not absolutely such a fool\r\nand sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate;\r\nbesides, five weeks ago I had nothing\u2014I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant;\r\nnow I have acquaintance, a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God;\r\nthe generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you is dark\r\nand empty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow\r\nimpatient under one of loneliness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good\r\nsense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears\r\nof Lot\u2019s wife. What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but\r\nI counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look\r\nback: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is what I mean to do,\u201d I answered. St. John continued\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of\r\nnature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a\r\nmeasure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a\r\nsustenance they cannot get\u2014when our will strains after a path we may not\r\nfollow\u2014we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we\r\nhave but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden\r\nfood it longed to taste\u2014and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous\r\nfoot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us,\r\nif rougher than it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a\r\nmistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death. I\r\nburnt for the more active life of the world\u2014for the more exciting toils of a\r\nliterary career\u2014for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather\r\nthan that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a\r\nvotary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my\r\ncurate\u2019s surplice. I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed,\r\nor I must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and\r\nrelief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without\r\nbounds\u2014my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength,\r\nspread their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear\r\nwhich afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the\r\nbest qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for\r\nthese all centre in the good missionary.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind changed; the\r\nfetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage\r\nbut its galling soreness\u2014which time only can heal. My father, indeed, imposed\r\nthe determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to\r\ncontend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an\r\nentanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder\u2014a last\r\nconflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have\r\nvowed that I will overcome\u2014and I leave Europe for the East.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he\r\nhad ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.\r\nBoth he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the\r\nwicket. We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in\r\nthe vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then\r\nstart when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quicker to\r\nrecognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his\r\ntail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical\r\naccents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood yet, at\r\nthe close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had\r\nsurprised him\u2014his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west.\r\nHe turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me,\r\nhad risen at his side. There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in\r\npure white\u2014a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when,\r\nafter bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long\r\nveil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty\r\nis a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features\r\nas ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as\r\never her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in\r\nthis instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the\r\nyoung girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we\r\nsee them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy\r\neyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled\r\nbrow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\r\nrepose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and\r\nsmooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and\r\ngleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich,\r\nplenteous tresses\u2014all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal\r\nof beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I\r\nadmired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her in a partial\r\nmood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed\r\nthis, her darling, with a grand-dame\u2019s bounty.\r\n\n\r\nWhat did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked myself\r\nthat question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I\r\nsought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He had already withdrawn\r\nhis eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew\r\nby the wicket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,\u201d he said, as he crushed\r\nthe snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I only came home from S\u2014\u2014\u201d (she mentioned the name of a large town some\r\ntwenty miles distant) \u201cthis afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school,\r\nand that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and\r\nran up the valley to see her: this is she?\u201d pointing to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d said St. John.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you think you shall like Morton?\u201d she asked of me, with a direct and na\u00efve\r\nsimplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like your house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave I furnished it nicely?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery nicely, indeed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have indeed. She is teachable and handy.\u201d (This then, I thought, is Miss\r\nOliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in\r\nthose of nature! What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth,\r\nI wonder?)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will be a\r\nchange for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr. Rivers, I\r\nhave been so gay during my stay at S\u2014\u2014. Last night, or rather this\r\nmorning, I was dancing till two o\u2019clock. The \u2014\u2014th regiment are stationed there\r\nsince the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they\r\nput all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Mr. St. John\u2019s under lip protruded, and his upper lip\r\ncurled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the\r\nlower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave\r\nhim this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it\r\non her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. She answered it with\r\na second laugh, and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her\r\nbright eyes.\r\n\n\r\nAs he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. \u201cPoor Carlo\r\nloves me,\u201d said she. \u201cHe is not stern and distant to his friends; and if\r\nhe could speak, he would not be silent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs she patted the dog\u2019s head, bending with native grace before his young and\r\naustere master, I saw a glow rise to that master\u2019s face. I saw his solemn eye\r\nmelt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled\r\nthus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest\r\nheaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had\r\nexpanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of\r\nliberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing\r\nsteed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa says you never come to see us now,\u201d continued Miss Oliver, looking up.\r\n\u201cYou are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very\r\nwell: will you return with me and visit him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,\u201d answered St. John.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most\r\nwants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him.\r\nNow, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?\u201d\r\nShe filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI forgot!\u201d she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at\r\nherself. \u201cI am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It had slipped my\r\nmemory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.\r\nDiana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely.\r\nI am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort it\r\ncost him thus to refuse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any\r\nlonger: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe held out her hand. He just touched it. \u201cGood evening!\u201d he repeated, in a\r\nvoice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you well?\u201d she asked. Well might she put the question: his face was\r\nblanched as her gown.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite well,\u201d he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She went one\r\nway; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like\r\ndown the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.\r\n\n\r\nThis spectacle of another\u2019s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from\r\nexclusive meditation on my own.

{"34": "\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\r\nI continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I\r\ncould. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my\r\nefforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly untaught, with\r\nfaculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight,\r\nall dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst\r\nthem as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this\r\ndifference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my\r\nrules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\r\nrustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves\r\nobliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of\r\nnatural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity,\r\nthat won both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in\r\ndoing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks\r\nregularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The rapidity of their\r\nprogress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride\r\nI took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and\r\nthey liked me. I had amongst my scholars several farmers\u2019 daughters: young\r\nwomen grown, almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I\r\ntaught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\r\nneedlework. I found estimable characters amongst them\u2014characters desirous of\r\ninformation and disposed for improvement\u2014with whom I passed many a pleasant\r\nevening hour in their own homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife)\r\nloaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple\r\nkindness, and in repaying it by a consideration\u2014a scrupulous regard to their\r\nfeelings\u2014to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which\r\nboth charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own\r\neyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\r\n\n\r\nI felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard\r\non all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles. To\r\nlive amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is\r\nlike \u201csitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;\u201d serene inward feelings bud and\r\nbloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled\r\nwith thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all,\r\nin the midst of this calm, this useful existence\u2014after a day passed in\r\nhonourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading\r\ncontentedly alone\u2014I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams\r\nmany-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy\u2014dreams\r\nwhere, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and\r\nromantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some\r\nexciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice,\r\nmeeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by\r\nhim\u2014the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its\r\nfirst force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how\r\nsituated. Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and\r\nthen the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the\r\nburst of passion. By nine o\u2019clock the next morning I was punctually opening the\r\nschool; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.\r\n\n\r\nRosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the school was\r\ngenerally made in the course of her morning ride. She would canter up to the\r\ndoor on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant. Anything more exquisite\r\nthan her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon\u2019s cap of black velvet\r\nplaced gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her\r\nshoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic\r\nbuilding, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children. She\r\ngenerally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily\r\ncatechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the\r\nyoung pastor\u2019s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,\r\neven when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door,\r\nif she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features,\r\nthough they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very\r\nquiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working\r\nmuscle or darting glance could indicate.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,\r\nconceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went up and\r\naddressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his\r\nhand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say, with his sad and\r\nresolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, \u201cI love you, and I know you\r\nprefer me. It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my\r\nheart, I believe you would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a\r\nsacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a\r\nsacrifice consumed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften\r\nher radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in\r\ntransient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St.\r\nJohn, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when\r\nshe thus left him; but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish,\r\nfor the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides,\r\nhe could not bind all that he had in his nature\u2014the rover, the aspirant, the\r\npoet, the priest\u2014in the limits of a single passion. He could not\u2014he would\r\nnot\u2014renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace\r\nof Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his\r\nreserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I had\r\nlearnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she was\r\ncoquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. She had\r\nbeen indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but\r\ngood-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass\r\nshowed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed;\r\ninnocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay,\r\nlively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool\r\nobserver of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or\r\nthoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for\r\ninstance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked my\r\npupil Ad\u00e8le; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a\r\ncloser affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\n\r\nShe had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only,\r\ncertainly, she allowed, \u201cnot one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat\r\nlittle soul enough, but he was an angel.\u201d I was, however, good, clever,\r\ncomposed, and firm, like him. I was a lusus natur\u00e6, she affirmed,\r\nas a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history, if known, would\r\nmake a delightful romance.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not\r\noffensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer\r\nof my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of\r\nSchiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and\r\nsome sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one\r\nof my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and\r\non the surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then\r\nelectrified with delight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love\u2014what a\r\nmiracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first school in S\u2014\u2014. Would\r\nI sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea\r\nof copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then on a dark-blue\r\nsilk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut\r\ntresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural\r\ncurls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. I\r\npromised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then,\r\nI told her she must come and sit another day.\r\n\n\r\nShe made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself accompanied\r\nher next evening\u2014a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at\r\nwhose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.\r\nHe appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to\r\nme. The sketch of Rosamond\u2019s portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a\r\nfinished picture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend\r\nthe evening at Vale Hall.\r\n\n\r\nI went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of\r\nwealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I\r\nstayed. Her father was affable; and when he entered into conversation with me\r\nafter tea, he expressed in strong terms his approbation of what I had done in\r\nMorton school, and said he only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too\r\ngood for the place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d cried Rosamond, \u201cshe is clever enough to be a governess in a high\r\nfamily, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land.\r\nMr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers\u2014of the Rivers family\u2014with great respect. He said\r\nit was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house\r\nwere wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he\r\nconsidered the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an\r\nalliance with the best. He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a\r\nyoung man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was\r\nquite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would\r\nthrow no obstacle in the way of Rosamond\u2019s union with St. John. Mr. Oliver\r\nevidently regarded the young clergyman\u2019s good birth, old name, and sacred\r\nprofession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.\r\n\n\r\nIt was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after helping me\r\nto clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her\r\naid. All about me was spotless and bright\u2014scoured floor, polished grate, and\r\nwell-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon\r\nbefore me to spend as I would.\r\n\n\r\nThe translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my\r\npalette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation,\r\nof completing Rosamond Oliver\u2019s miniature. The head was finished already: there\r\nwas but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of\r\ncarmine, too, to add to the ripe lips\u2014a soft curl here and there to the\r\ntresses\u2014a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was\r\nabsorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my\r\ndoor unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am come to see how you are spending your holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cNot, I hope, in\r\nthought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I\r\nmistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought\r\nyou a book for evening solace,\u201d and he laid on the table a new publication\u2014a\r\npoem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate\r\npublic of those days\u2014the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of\r\nour era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or\r\nrepine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power\r\nover either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their\r\npresence, their liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in\r\nheaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their\r\ndestruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let\r\nenvy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem:\r\nand without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell\u2014the\r\nhell of your own meanness.\r\n\n\r\nWhile I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of \u201cMarmion\u201d (for \u201cMarmion\u201d it\r\nwas), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall figure sprang erect\r\nagain with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at him: he shunned my eye. I\r\nknew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly; at the moment I felt\r\ncalmer and cooler than he: I had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I\r\nconceived an inclination to do him some good, if I could.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith all his firmness and self-control,\u201d thought I, \u201che tasks himself too far:\r\nlocks every feeling and pang within\u2014expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am\r\nsure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he\r\nthinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said first, \u201cTake a chair, Mr. Rivers.\u201d But he answered, as he always did,\r\nthat he could not stay. \u201cVery well,\u201d I responded, mentally, \u201cstand if you like;\r\nbut you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for\r\nyou as it is for me. I\u2019ll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your\r\nconfidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed\r\none drop of the balm of sympathy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs this portrait like?\u201d I asked bluntly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLike! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did, Mr. Rivers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me\r\nastonished. \u201cOh, that is nothing yet,\u201d I muttered within. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be\r\nbaffled by a little stiffness on your part; I\u2019m prepared to go to considerable\r\nlengths.\u201d I continued, \u201cYou observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no\r\nobjection to your looking at it again,\u201d and I rose and placed it in his hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA well-executed picture,\u201d he said; \u201cvery soft, clear colouring; very graceful\r\nand correct drawing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMastering some hesitation, he answered, \u201cMiss Oliver, I presume.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise\r\nto paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided\r\nyou admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I don\u2019t wish to throw away\r\nmy time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he held\r\nit, the more he seemed to covet it. \u201cIt is like!\u201d he murmured; \u201cthe eye is well\r\nmanaged: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting? Tell me\r\nthat. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a\r\nconsolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it\r\nbring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he\r\nagain surveyed the picture.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or\r\nwise is another question.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSince I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her father\r\nwas not likely to oppose the match, I\u2014less exalted in my views than St.\r\nJohn\u2014had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate their union. It\r\nseemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver\u2019s large\r\nfortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out\r\nto wither, and his strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this\r\npersuasion I now answered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take\r\nto yourself the original at once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBy this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before him,\r\nand with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it. I discerned he\r\nwas now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus\r\nfrankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable\u2014to hear it thus\r\nfreely handled\u2014was beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure\u2014an unhoped-for\r\nrelief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their\r\nsentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is\r\nhuman after all; and to \u201cburst\u201d with boldness and good-will into \u201cthe silent\r\nsea\u201d of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe likes you, I am sure,\u201d said I, as I stood behind his chair, \u201cand her\r\nfather respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl\u2014rather thoughtless; but you\r\nwould have sufficient thought for both yourself and her. You ought to marry\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes she like me?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you continually:\r\nthere is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is very pleasant to hear this,\u201d he said\u2014\u201cvery: go on for another quarter of\r\nan hour.\u201d And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon the table to\r\nmeasure the time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut where is the use of going on,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhen you are probably preparing\r\nsome iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your\r\nheart?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing:\r\nhuman love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing\r\nwith sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour\r\nprepared\u2014so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying\r\nplans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood\u2014the young germs\r\nswamped\u2014delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an\r\nottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver\u2019s feet:\r\nshe is talking to me with her sweet voice\u2014gazing down on me with those eyes\r\nyour skilful hand has copied so well\u2014smiling at me with these coral lips. She\r\nis mine\u2014I am hers\u2014this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say\r\nnothing\u2014my heart is full of delight\u2014my senses are entranced\u2014let the time I\r\nmarked pass in peace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood silent.\r\nAmidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture\r\ndown, rose, and stood on the hearth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthat little space was given to delirium and delusion. I rested\r\nmy temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her\r\nyoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in\r\nthe garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her promises are hollow\u2014her offers\r\nfalse: I see and know all this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI gazed at him in wonder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is strange,\u201d pursued he, \u201cthat while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly\u2014with\r\nall the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is\r\nexquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating\u2014I experience at the same time a\r\ncalm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she\r\nis not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year\r\nafter marriage; and that to twelve months\u2019 rapture would succeed a lifetime of\r\nregret. This I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStrange indeed!\u201d I could not help ejaculating.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhile something in me,\u201d he went on, \u201cis acutely sensible to her charms,\r\nsomething else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she\r\ncould sympathise in nothing I aspired to\u2014co-operate in nothing I undertook.\r\nRosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary\u2019s\r\nwife? No!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRelinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for\r\na mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all\r\nambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race\u2014of carrying knowledge\r\ninto the realms of ignorance\u2014of substituting peace for war\u2014freedom for\r\nbondage\u2014religion for superstition\u2014the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must\r\nI relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have\r\nto look forward to, and to live for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAfter a considerable pause, I said\u2014\u201cAnd Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and\r\nsorrow of no interest to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a\r\nmonth, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me; and will\r\nmarry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I should do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are wasting\r\naway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet\r\nunsettled\u2014my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, I\r\nreceived intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long\r\nexpecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and\r\nperhaps the three months may extend to six.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined that a\r\nwoman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in this sort of\r\ndiscourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and\r\nrefined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of\r\nconventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place\r\nby their heart\u2019s very hearthstone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are original,\u201d said he, \u201cand not timid. There is something brave in\r\nyour spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you\r\nthat you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them more profound and\r\npotent than they are. You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a\r\njust claim to. When I colour, and when I shake before Miss Oliver, I do not\r\npity myself. I scorn the weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the\r\nflesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed\r\nas a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am\u2014a\r\ncold hard man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled incredulously.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have taken my confidence by storm,\u201d he continued, \u201cand now it is much at\r\nyour service. I am simply, in my original state\u2014stripped of that blood-bleached\r\nrobe with which Christianity covers human deformity\u2014a cold, hard, ambitious\r\nman. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over\r\nme. Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire\r\nto rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance,\r\nperseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men\r\nachieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with\r\ninterest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic\r\nwoman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what\r\nyou still suffer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe;\r\nand I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a pagan, but a\r\nChristian philosopher\u2014a follower of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt\r\nHis pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to\r\nspread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities\r\nthus:\u2014From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the\r\novershadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human\r\nuprightness, she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition\r\nto win power and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to\r\nspread my Master\u2019s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.\r\nSo much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best\r\naccount; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate nature: nor\r\nwill it be eradicated \u2018till this mortal shall put on immortality.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHaving said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my palette.\r\nOnce more he looked at the portrait.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is lovely,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe is well named the Rose of the World,\r\nindeed!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd may I not paint one like it for you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCui bono? No.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to\r\nrest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he\r\nsuddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but\r\nsomething had caught his eye. He took it up with a snatch; he looked at the\r\nedge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite\r\nincomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in\r\nmy shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His\r\nlips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it\r\nwas.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing in the world,\u201d was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him\r\ndexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in his glove;\r\nand, with one hasty nod and \u201cgood-afternoon,\u201d he vanished.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, \u201cthat caps the globe,\r\nhowever!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy\r\nstains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pondered the mystery\r\na minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be\r\nof much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.\r\n\n"}
{"35": "\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\r\nWhen Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued\r\nall night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by\r\ntwilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed my\r\nshutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it,\r\ntrimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to\r\nthe muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down \u201cMarmion,\u201d and\r\nbeginning\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDay set on Norham\u2019s castled steep,\r\nAnd Tweed\u2019s fair river broad and deep,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Cheviot\u2019s mountains lone;\r\nThe massive towers, the donjon keep,\r\nThe flanking walls that round them sweep,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In yellow lustre shone\u201d\u2014\r\n\n\r\nI soon forgot storm in music.\r\n\n\r\nI heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St. John\r\nRivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane\u2014the howling\r\ndarkness\u2014and stood before me: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white\r\nas a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest\r\nfrom the blocked-up vale that night.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAny ill news?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHas anything happened?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. How very easily alarmed you are!\u201d he answered, removing his cloak and\r\nhanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat\r\nwhich his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow from his boots.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall sully the purity of your floor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you must excuse me for\r\nonce.\u201d Then he approached the fire. \u201cI have had hard work to get here, I assure\r\nyou,\u201d he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame. \u201cOne drift took me up\r\nto the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut why are you come?\u201d I could not forbear saying.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I\r\nanswer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and\r\nempty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a\r\nperson to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the\r\nsequel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began\r\nto fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his was a very cool\r\nand collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his\r\nlook more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he put aside his\r\nsnow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale\r\nbrow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of\r\ncare or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say\r\nsomething I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his\r\nfinger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted\r\nlike his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was\r\nmoved to say\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you\r\nshould be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said he: \u201cI care for myself when necessary. I am well now. What\r\ndo you see amiss in me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my\r\nsolicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I was silenced.\r\n\n\r\nHe still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt\r\ndreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, I asked him\r\npresently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d he responded shortly and somewhat testily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I reflected, \u201cif you won\u2019t talk, you may be still; I\u2019ll let you alone\r\nnow, and return to my book.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of \u201cMarmion.\u201d He soon stirred;\r\nmy eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a morocco\r\npocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence, folded it, put\r\nit back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain to try to read with such an\r\ninscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in impatience, consent to be dumb;\r\nhe might rebuff me if he liked, but talk I would.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard from Diana and Mary lately?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot since the letter I showed you a week ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You will not\r\nbe summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.\u201d Baffled so far, I\r\nchanged my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMary Garrett\u2019s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this\r\nmorning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close\u2014they\r\nwould have come to-day but for the snow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Oliver pays for two.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it your suggestion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhose, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis daughter\u2019s, I think.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is like her: she is so good-natured.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It aroused\r\nhim; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\nWondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHalf-an-hour ago,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of\r\na tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming\r\nthe narrator\u2019s part, and converting you into a listener. Before commencing, it\r\nis but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your\r\nears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass\r\nthrough new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwenty years ago, a poor curate\u2014never mind his name at this moment\u2014fell in\r\nlove with a rich man\u2019s daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him,\r\nagainst the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her\r\nimmediately after the wedding. Before two years passed, the rash pair were both\r\ndead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (I have seen their grave;\r\nit formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim,\r\nsoot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in \u2014\u2014shire.) They\r\nleft a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap\u2014cold as\r\nthat of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried the\r\nfriendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by\r\nan aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You\r\nstart\u2014did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the\r\nrafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and\r\naltered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.\u2014To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept\r\nthe orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never\r\nhaving been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you\r\nknow\u2014being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It\r\nseems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher,\r\nlike yourself\u2014really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and\r\nyours\u2014she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous;\r\nshe undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rivers!\u201d I interrupted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can guess your feelings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut restrain them for a while: I have\r\nnearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester\u2019s character I know\r\nnothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to\r\nthis young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet\r\nalive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a\r\nmatter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry\r\nafter the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone\u2014no one could tell\r\nwhen, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research\r\nafter her course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no\r\nvestige of information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be\r\nfound is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in\r\nall the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a\r\nsolicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not an odd\r\ntale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust tell me this,\u201d said I, \u201cand since you know so much, you surely can\r\ntell it me\u2014what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he doing? Is he\r\nwell?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him\r\nbut to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. You\r\nshould rather ask the name of the governess\u2014the nature of the event which\r\nrequires her appearance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut they wrote to him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did he say? Who has his letters?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.\r\nRochester, but from a lady: it is signed \u2018Alice Fairfax.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had in all\r\nprobability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former\r\nhaunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings\u2014what object\r\nfor his strong passions\u2014had he sought there? I dared not answer the question.\r\nOh, my poor master\u2014once almost my husband\u2014whom I had often called \u201cmy dear\r\nEdward!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe must have been a bad man,\u201d observed Mr. Rivers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know him\u2014don\u2019t pronounce an opinion upon him,\u201d I said, with warmth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he answered quietly: \u201cand indeed my head is otherwise occupied\r\nthan with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won\u2019t ask the governess\u2019s\r\nname, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it here\u2014it is always more\r\nsatisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black\r\nand white.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through;\r\nfrom one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn\r\noff: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and\r\nvermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover. He got up, held it close\r\nto my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words\r\n\u201cJANE EYRE\u201d\u2014the work doubtless of some moment of\r\nabstraction.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBriggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:\u201d he said, \u201cthe advertisements demanded a\r\nJane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.\u2014I confess I had my suspicions, but it was\r\nonly yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty. You own the\r\nname and renounce the alias?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than\r\nyou do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBriggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr.\r\nRochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime, you forget\r\nessential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought\r\nafter you\u2014what he wanted with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, what did he want?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has\r\nleft you all his property, and that you are now rich\u2014merely that\u2014nothing more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI!\u2014rich?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, you, rich\u2014quite an heiress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSilence succeeded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must prove your identity of course,\u201d resumed St. John presently: \u201ca step\r\nwhich will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession.\r\nYour fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the\r\nnecessary documents.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a\r\nmoment from indigence to wealth\u2014a very fine thing; but not a matter one can\r\ncomprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other\r\nchances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this is solid, an\r\naffair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its associations are\r\nsolid and sober, and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and\r\nspring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to\r\nconsider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady\r\nsatisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over\r\nour bliss with a solemn brow.\r\n\n\r\nBesides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death,\r\nFuneral. My uncle I had heard was dead\u2014my only relative; ever since being made\r\naware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now, I\r\nnever should. And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing\r\nfamily, but to my isolated self. It was a grand boon doubtless; and\r\nindependence would be glorious\u2014yes, I felt that\u2014that thought swelled my\r\nheart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou unbend your forehead at last,\u201d said Mr. Rivers. \u201cI thought Medusa had\r\nlooked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how\r\nmuch you are worth?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow much am I worth?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of\u2014twenty thousand pounds, I think\r\nthey say\u2014but what is that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwenty thousand pounds?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere was a new stunner\u2014I had been calculating on four or five thousand. This\r\nnews actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard\r\nlaugh before, laughed now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cif you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime\r\nwas discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a large sum\u2014don\u2019t you think there is a mistake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo mistake at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you have read the figures wrong\u2014it may be two thousand!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is written in letters, not figures,\u2014twenty thousand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers\r\nsitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred.\r\nMr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf it were not such a very wild night,\u201d he said, \u201cI would send Hannah down to\r\nkeep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone. But\r\nHannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I: her legs are not\r\nquite so long: so I must e\u2019en leave you to your sorrows. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStop one minute!\u201d I cried.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he knew\r\nyou, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the\r\npower to aid in my discovery.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I am a clergyman,\u201d he said; \u201cand the clergy are often appealed to about\r\nodd matters.\u201d Again the latch rattled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; that does not satisfy me!\u201d I exclaimed: and indeed there was something in\r\nthe hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my\r\ncuriosity more than ever.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a very strange piece of business,\u201d I added; \u201cI must know more about it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnother time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; to-night!\u2014to-night!\u201d and as he turned from the door, I placed myself\r\nbetween it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou certainly shall not go till you have told me all,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather not just now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall!\u2014you must!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather Diana or Mary informed you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must\r\nbe, and that without delay; and I told him so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I apprised you that I was a hard man,\u201d said he, \u201cdifficult to persuade.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am a hard woman,\u2014impossible to put off.\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI am cold: no fervour infects me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed all the\r\nsnow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and\r\nmade it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers,\r\nthe high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I\r\nwish to know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, \u201cI yield; if not to your earnestness, to your\r\nperseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must know\r\nsome day,\u2014as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course: that was all settled before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?\u2014that I was christened St.\r\nJohn Eyre Rivers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials\r\nwritten in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for\r\nwhat name it stood. But what then? Surely\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the\r\nthought that rushed upon me\u2014that embodied itself,\u2014that, in a second, stood out\r\na strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves,\r\nshot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of\r\nlinks was drawn out straight,\u2014every ring was perfect, the connection complete.\r\nI knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another\r\nword; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so\r\nI must repeat his explanation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married\r\nMiss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of\r\nFunchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre\u2019s solicitor, wrote to us last\r\nAugust to inform us of our uncle\u2019s death, and to say that he had left his\r\nproperty to his brother the clergyman\u2019s orphan daughter, overlooking us, in\r\nconsequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote\r\nagain a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if\r\nwe knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled\r\nme to find her out. You know the rest.\u201d Again he was going, but I set my back\r\nagainst the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo let me speak,\u201d I said; \u201clet me have one moment to draw breath and reflect.\u201d\r\nI paused\u2014he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour mother was my father\u2019s sister?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy aunt, consequently?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister\u2019s\r\nchildren, as I am his brother\u2019s child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUndeniably.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the\r\nsame source?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe are cousins; yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud of,\u2014one I\r\ncould love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them\r\nbut as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and\r\nadmiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and\r\nlooking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed\r\nwith so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and\r\nthe young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold\r\nwas my blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth\r\nindeed!\u2014wealth to the heart!\u2014a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a\r\nblessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;\u2014not like the ponderous gift of gold:\r\nrich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now clapped\r\nmy hands in sudden joy\u2014my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I am glad!\u2014I am glad!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\n\r\nSt. John smiled. \u201cDid I not say you neglected essential points to pursue\r\ntrifles?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou were serious when I told you you had got a fortune;\r\nand now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and\r\ndon\u2019t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,\u2014or two, if\r\nyou don\u2019t choose to be counted,\u2014are born into my world full-grown. I say again,\r\nI am glad!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts\r\nthat rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them:\u2014thoughts of\r\nwhat might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long. I looked at the\r\nblank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,\u2014every one lit me to a\r\npurpose or delight. Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had\r\nloved barrenly, I could now benefit. They were under a yoke,\u2014I could free them:\r\nthey were scattered,\u2014I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence\r\nwhich was mine, might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds\r\nshared equally would be five thousand each, justice\u2014enough and to spare:\r\njustice would be done,\u2014mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh\r\non me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,\u2014it was a legacy of life, hope,\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\n\r\nHow I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell;\r\nbut I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was\r\ngently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also advised me to be composed;\r\nI scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand,\r\nand began to walk about again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWrite to Diana and Mary to-morrow,\u201d I said, \u201cand tell them to come home\r\ndirectly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand\r\npounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me where I can get you a glass of water,\u201d said St. John; \u201cyou must really\r\nmake an effort to tranquillise your feelings.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you? Will it\r\nkeep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an\r\nordinary mortal?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in\r\ncommunicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you\r\nwho misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend\r\nbetter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExplain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand\r\npounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three\r\nnieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each? What I want is, that you\r\nshould write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo you, you mean.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other. I am\r\nnot brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am\r\nresolved I will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and I will live\r\nat Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to\r\nDiana and Mary. It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it\r\nwould torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could\r\nnever be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what\r\nis absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no discussion\r\nabout it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a\r\nmatter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the\r\ncase?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom. Besides,\r\nthe entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; he was\r\nfree to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you. After all, justice\r\npermits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it\r\nabsolutely your own.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith me,\u201d said I, \u201cit is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I\r\nmust indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so. Were\r\nyou to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious\r\npleasure of which I have caught a glimpse\u2014that of repaying, in part, a mighty\r\nobligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think so now,\u201d rejoined St. John, \u201cbecause you do not know what it is to\r\npossess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the\r\nimportance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable\r\nyou to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d I interrupted, \u201ccannot at all imagine the craving I have for\r\nfraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers or\r\nsisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and\r\nown me, are you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I will be your brother\u2014my sisters will be your sisters\u2014without\r\nstipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBrother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes; slaving\r\namongst strangers! I, wealthy\u2014gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit!\r\nYou, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate\r\nattachment!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be\r\nrealised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, again! Marry! I don\u2019t want to marry, and never shall marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the\r\nexcitement under which you labour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my\r\ninclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for love;\r\nand I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation. And I do\r\nnot want a stranger\u2014unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my\r\nkindred: those with whom I have full fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my\r\nbrother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you\r\ncan, repeat them sincerely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what\r\nmy affection for them is grounded,\u2014respect for their worth and admiration of\r\ntheir talents. You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble\r\nDiana\u2019s and Mary\u2019s; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your\r\nconversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can\r\neasily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest\r\nsister.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for if you\r\nstay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.\r\n\n\r\nI need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used,\r\nto get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My task was a very\r\nhard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved\u2014as my cousins saw at length that my\r\nmind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the\r\nproperty\u2014as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the\r\nintention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place\r\nthey would have done precisely what I wished to do\u2014they yielded at length so\r\nfar as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr.\r\nOliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.\r\nThe instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each\r\nbecame possessed of a competency.\r\n\n"}
{"36": "\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\r\nIt was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general\r\nholiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting\r\nshould not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the\r\nheart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but\r\nto afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt\r\nwith pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted,\r\nthat consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and\r\nstrongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their\r\nunsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future\r\nthat I did not visit them, and give them an hour\u2019s teaching in their school.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file\r\nout before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging\r\na few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as\r\ndecent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in\r\nthe ranks of the British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after\r\nall, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most\r\nself-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and\r\nB\u00e4uerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and\r\nbesotted, compared with my Morton girls.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?\u201d asked Mr.\r\nRivers, when they were gone. \u201cDoes not the consciousness of having done some\r\nreal good in your day and generation give pleasure?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the task of\r\nregenerating your race be well spent?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said; \u201cbut I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own\r\nfaculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must enjoy them now;\r\ndon\u2019t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed\r\nfor full holiday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked grave. \u201cWhat now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are\r\nyou going to do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set Hannah at\r\nliberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you want her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a week,\r\nand I want to have everything in order against their arrival.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It is\r\nbetter so: Hannah shall go with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will\r\ngive you the key of my cottage in the morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took it. \u201cYou give it up very gleefully,\u201d said he; \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\r\nyour light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to\r\nyourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing. What aim, what\r\npurpose, what ambition in life have you now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full force of\r\nthe expression?)\u2014to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar; my\r\nnext to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till\r\nit glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with\r\nmathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and\r\npeat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding\r\nthat on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to\r\nsuch a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of\r\nChristmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of\r\nother culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the\r\nuninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an\r\nabsolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday;\r\nand my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSt. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is all very well for the present,\u201d said he; \u201cbut seriously, I trust that\r\nwhen the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than\r\ndomestic endearments and household joys.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe best things the world has!\u201d I interrupted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make\r\nit so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean, on the contrary, to be busy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I excuse you for the present: two months\u2019 grace I allow you for the full\r\nenjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found\r\ncharm of relationship; but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond\r\nMoor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual\r\ncomfort of civilised affluence. I hope your energies will then once more\r\ntrouble you with their strength.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked at him with surprise. \u201cSt. John,\u201d I said, \u201cI think you are almost\r\nwicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to\r\nstir me up to restlessness! To what end?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your\r\nkeeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account. Jane, I\r\nshall watch you closely and anxiously\u2014I warn you of that. And try to restrain\r\nthe disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace\r\nhome pleasures. Don\u2019t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your\r\nconstancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite\r\ntransient objects. Do you hear, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause to be\r\nhappy, and I will be happy. Goodbye!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHappy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was\r\ncharmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned\r\ntopsy-turvy\u2014how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after\r\na day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to\r\ninvoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a\r\njourney to S\u2014\u2014 to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me\r\ncarte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having\r\nbeen set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left\r\nmuch as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from\r\nseeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\r\nspectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to\r\ngive to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark\r\nhandsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected\r\nantique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and\r\ndressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh\r\nwithout being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with\r\nold mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets\r\non the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\r\nof bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of\r\nwintry waste and desert dreariness without.\r\n\n\r\nThe eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark, and ere\r\ndusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah\r\nand I were dressed, and all was in readiness.\r\n\n\r\nSt. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house\r\ntill everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at\r\nonce sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to\r\nestrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain\r\ncakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, \u201cIf I was at last\r\nsatisfied with housemaid\u2019s work?\u201d I answered by inviting him to accompany me on\r\na general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got\r\nhim to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and\r\nwhen he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through\r\na great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes\r\nin so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the\r\nimproved aspect of his abode.\r\n\n\r\nThis silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some\r\nold associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a\r\nsomewhat crest-fallen tone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\r\nrespected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more\r\nthought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I\r\ndevoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?\u2014By-the-bye, could I tell\r\nhim where such a book was?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to his\r\naccustomed window recess, he began to read it.\r\n\n\r\nNow, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel\r\nhe had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold. The\r\nhumanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him\u2014its peaceful\r\nenjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire\u2014after what was good and\r\ngreat, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting\r\nround him. As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white\r\nstone\u2014at his fine lineaments fixed in study\u2014I comprehended all at once that he\r\nwould hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his\r\nwife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;\r\nI agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he\r\nshould despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he\r\nshould wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever\r\nconducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material\r\nfrom which nature hews her heroes\u2014Christian and Pagan\u2014her lawgivers, her\r\nstatesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest\r\nupon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of\r\nplace.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis parlour is not his sphere,\u201d I reflected: \u201cthe Himalayan ridge or Caffre\r\nbush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better. Well may\r\nhe eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties\r\nstagnate\u2014they cannot develop or appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife\r\nand danger\u2014where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude\r\ntasked\u2014that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child\r\nwould have the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a\r\nmissionary\u2019s career\u2014I see it now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are coming! they are coming!\u201d cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour\r\ndoor. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark;\r\nbut a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The\r\nvehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one\r\nwell-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under\r\ntheir bonnets, in contact first with Mary\u2019s soft cheek, then with Diana\u2019s\r\nflowing curls. They laughed\u2014kissed me\u2014then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half\r\nwild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the\r\naffirmative, hastened into the house.\r\n\n\r\nThey were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled\r\nwith the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the\r\ncheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they\r\ndemanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from the parlour. They both threw\r\ntheir arms round his neck at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low\r\ntone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then,\r\nintimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew\r\nthere as to a place of refuge.\r\n\n\r\nI had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable\r\norders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me. They were delighted\r\nwith the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and\r\nfresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification\r\nungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their\r\nwishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous\r\nreturn home.\r\n\n\r\nSweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in\r\nnarrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John\u2019s taciturnity: he\r\nwas sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of\r\njoy he could not sympathise. The event of the day\u2014that is, the return of Diana\r\nand Mary\u2014pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult,\r\nthe garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow\r\nwas come. In the very meridian of the night\u2019s enjoyment, about an hour after\r\ntea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that \u201ca\r\npoor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his\r\nmother, who was drawing away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere does she live, Hannah?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cClear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him I will go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, sir, you had better not. It\u2019s the worst road to travel after dark\r\nthat can be: there\u2019s no track at all over the bog. And then it is such a bitter\r\nnight\u2014the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send word, sir, that you\r\nwill be there in the morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one\r\nobjection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o\u2019clock: he did not return\r\ntill midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when\r\nhe set out. He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own\r\nstrength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.\r\n\n\r\nI am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was Christmas\r\nweek: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry\r\ndomestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of\r\nprosperity, acted on Diana and Mary\u2019s spirits like some life-giving elixir:\r\nthey were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. They could\r\nalways talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for\r\nme, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.\r\nSt. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in\r\nthe house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily\r\nbusiness in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some\r\nminutes, asked him, \u201cIf his plans were yet unchanged.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnchanged and unchangeable,\u201d was the reply. And he proceeded to inform us that\r\nhis departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Rosamond Oliver?\u201d suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips\r\ninvoluntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as\r\nif wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his hand\u2014it was his unsocial\r\ncustom to read at meals\u2014he closed it, and looked up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRosamond Oliver,\u201d said he, \u201cis about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the\r\nbest connected and most estimable residents in S\u2014\u2014, grandson and heir to Sir\r\nFrederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was\r\nserene as glass.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe match must have been got up hastily,\u201d said Diana: \u201cthey cannot have known\r\neach other long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut two months: they met in October at the county ball at S\u2014\u2014. But where there\r\nare no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in\r\nevery point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as\r\nS\u2014\u2014 Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can be refitted for their\r\nreception.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted\r\nto inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little to need\r\nsympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I experienced some\r\nshame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded. Besides, I was out of\r\npractice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness\r\nwas congealed beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his\r\nsisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did\r\nnot at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was\r\nacknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the\r\ndistance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the\r\nvillage schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to\r\nhis confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.\r\n\n\r\nSuch being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his head\r\nsuddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStartled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment\u2019s\r\nhesitation I answered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose\r\ntriumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called\r\nupon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is decisive: my way\r\nis now clear; I thank God for it!\u201d So saying, he returned to his papers and his\r\nsilence.\r\n\n\r\nAs our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana\u2019s, Mary\u2019s, and mine) settled into a\r\nquieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St.\r\nJohn stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours\r\ntogether. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclop\u00e6dic reading\r\nshe had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he\r\npondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition\r\nof which he thought necessary to his plans.\r\n\n\r\nThus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed\r\nenough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking\r\ngrammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students,\r\nwith a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly\r\nwithdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table. I wondered\r\nwhat it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to\r\nexhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly\r\nvisit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was\r\nunfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged\r\nme not to go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage\r\nme to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane is not such a weakling as you would make her,\u201d he would say: \u201cshe can\r\nbear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of\r\nus. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;\u2014better calculated to endure\r\nvariations of climate than many more robust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little\r\nweather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be\r\nto vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special\r\nannoyance.\r\n\n\r\nOne afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a\r\ncold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he,\r\ndeciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation for an\r\nexercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence\r\nof the ever-watchful blue eye. How long it had been searching me through and\r\nthrough, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I\r\nfelt for the moment superstitious\u2014as if I were sitting in the room with\r\nsomething uncanny.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, what are you doing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLearning German.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not in earnest?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at\r\npresent studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement;\r\nthat it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and\r\nagain go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his\r\nchoice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters; but that he had\r\nfixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three.\r\nWould I do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice\r\nlong, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.\r\n\n\r\nSt. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression\r\nmade on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. I\r\nconsented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her scholar\r\ntransferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both she and Mary agreed\r\nthat St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step. He answered\r\nquietly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he\r\nexpected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in\r\nhis own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain\r\ninfluence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were\r\nmore restraining than his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely\r\nwhen he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that\r\nvivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that\r\nonly serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every\r\neffort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing\r\nspell. When he said \u201cgo,\u201d I went; \u201ccome,\u201d I came; \u201cdo this,\u201d I did it. But I\r\ndid not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding him\r\ngood-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was equally his\r\ncustom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour\r\n(she was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way,\r\nwas as strong), exclaimed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don\u2019t treat her as\r\nsuch: you should kiss her too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt\r\nuncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John\r\nbent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes\r\nquestioned my eyes piercingly\u2014he kissed me. There are no such things as marble\r\nkisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin\u2019s salute\r\nbelonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his\r\nwas an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was\r\nnot striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little\r\npale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never\r\nomitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I\r\nunderwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\r\n\n\r\nAs for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more\r\nand more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my\r\ntastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for\r\nwhich I had no natural vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could\r\nnever reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The\r\nthing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and\r\nclassic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and\r\nsolemn lustre of his own.\r\n\n\r\nNot his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of late it had\r\nbeen easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and\r\ndrained my happiness at its source\u2014the evil of suspense.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes\r\nof place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with me, because it\r\nwas not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could\r\nwash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the\r\nmarble it inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me\r\neverywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to\r\nthink of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood\r\nover it.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I\r\nhad inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester\u2019s present residence and state\r\nof health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all\r\nconcerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the\r\nsubject. I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt\r\nsure it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed\r\nwithout reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post\r\narrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\r\n\n\r\nI wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed. Renewed\r\nhope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then,\r\nlike it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me. When half a\r\nyear wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.\r\n\n\r\nA fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer approached; Diana\r\ntried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the\r\nsea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted\r\nemployment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I\r\nsuppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my\r\nlessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment:\r\nand I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him\u2014I could not resist him.\r\n\n\r\nOne day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was\r\noccasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me in the\r\nmorning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost\r\ncertain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found\r\nonly an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business. The bitter check had\r\nwrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters\r\nand flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.\r\n\n\r\nSt. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice\r\nfailed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only occupants of the\r\nparlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was\r\ngardening\u2014it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy. My companion\r\nexpressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me as to its cause;\r\nhe only said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.\u201d And while I\r\nsmothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his\r\ndesk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected\r\nand fully understood crisis in a patient\u2019s malady. Having stifled my sobs,\r\nwiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I\r\nresumed my task, and succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and\r\nhis, locked his desk, and said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will call Diana and Mary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put on your\r\nthings; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh\r\nGlen: I will join you in a moment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with\r\npositive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission\r\nand determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the\r\nvery moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and\r\nas neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to\r\nmutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John\u2019s directions; and in ten\r\nminutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.\r\n\n\r\nThe breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of\r\nheath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the\r\nravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear,\r\ncatching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament. As\r\nwe advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald\r\ngreen, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a\r\nstar-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen,\r\ntowards its head, wound to their very core.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet us rest here,\u201d said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a\r\nbattalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down\r\na waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and\r\nflower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem\u2014where it exaggerated the\r\nwild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning\u2014where it guarded\r\nthe forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.\r\n\n\r\nI took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down the\r\nhollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the\r\nunclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his\r\nhair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt:\r\nwith his eye he bade farewell to something.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall see it again,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cin dreams when I sleep by the\r\nGanges: and again in a more remote hour\u2014when another slumber overcomes me\u2014on\r\nthe shore of a darker stream!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStrange words of a strange love! An austere patriot\u2019s passion for his\r\nfatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor\r\nI to him: that interval past, he recommenced\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails\r\non the 20th of June.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,\u201d I answered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cthere is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an infallible\r\nMaster. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws\r\nand erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain,\r\nis the All-perfect. It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to\r\nenlist under the same banner,\u2014to join in the same enterprise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to\r\nmarch with the strong.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are\r\nworthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThose are few in number, and difficult to discover.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up\u2014to urge and exhort\r\nthem to the effort\u2014to show them what their gifts are, and why they were\r\ngiven\u2014to speak Heaven\u2019s message in their ear,\u2014to offer them, direct from God, a\r\nplace in the ranks of His chosen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the\r\nfirst to inform them of it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled\r\nto hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does your heart say?\u201d demanded St. John.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy heart is mute,\u2014my heart is mute,\u201d I answered, struck and thrilled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I must speak for it,\u201d continued the deep, relentless voice. \u201cJane, come\r\nwith me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard a\r\nsummons from Heaven\u2014as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had\r\nenounced, \u201cCome over and help us!\u201d But I was no apostle,\u2014I could not behold the\r\nherald,\u2014I could not receive his call.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, St. John!\u201d I cried, \u201chave some mercy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, knew\r\nneither mercy nor remorse. He continued\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod and nature intended you for a missionary\u2019s wife. It is not personal, but\r\nmental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.\r\nA missionary\u2019s wife you must\u2014shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you\u2014not for\r\nmy pleasure, but for my Sovereign\u2019s service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not fit for it: I have no vocation,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\nHe had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by them.\r\nIndeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his arms on his\r\nchest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying\r\nopposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him to its\r\nclose\u2014resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumility, Jane,\u201d said he, \u201cis the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say\r\nright that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever\r\nwas truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am\r\nbut dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of\r\nsinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I\r\nknow my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a\r\nfeeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores\r\nof His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like\r\nme, Jane\u2014trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not\r\ndoubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary\r\nlabours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your\r\ntask from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.\r\nThis I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as\r\nstrong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut my powers\u2014where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them. Nothing\r\nspeaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light kindling\u2014no\r\nlife quickening\u2014no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you\r\nsee how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one\r\nshrinking fear fettered in its depths\u2014the fear of being persuaded by you to\r\nattempt what I cannot accomplish!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have an answer for you\u2014hear it. I have watched you ever since we first met:\r\nI have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you in that time by\r\nsundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the village school I found\r\nyou could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your\r\nhabits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you\r\ncould win while you controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had\r\nbecome suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:\u2014lucre had no\r\nundue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth\r\ninto four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three\r\nothers to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in\r\nthe flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my\r\nwish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another\r\nbecause it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since\r\npersevered in it\u2014in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you\r\nhave met its difficulties\u2014I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.\r\nJane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and\r\ncourageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself\u2014I can\r\ntrust you unreservedly. As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper\r\namongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step.\r\nShut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way,\r\nwhich had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared\r\nso vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed\r\na definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a\r\nquarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery willingly,\u201d he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the\r\npass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cI can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge\r\nthat,\u201d I meditated,\u2014\u201cthat is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is not the\r\nexistence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then? He does not\r\ncare for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity\r\nand sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is very plain before me. In\r\nleaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land\u2014Mr. Rochester is not\r\nthere; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to\r\nlive without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day,\r\nas if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might\r\nreunite me to him. Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another\r\ninterest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers\r\nme truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble\r\ncares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by\r\nuptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes\u2014and yet I\r\nshudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I\r\ngo to premature death. And how will the interval between leaving England for\r\nIndia, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very\r\nclear to my vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I\r\nshall satisfy him\u2014to the finest central point and farthest outward\r\ncircle of his expectations. If I do go with him\u2014if I do make the\r\nsacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the\r\naltar\u2014heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall\r\napprove me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has\r\nnever suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little\r\ngrudging.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConsent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item\u2014one dreadful item.\r\nIt is\u2014that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband\u2019s heart for\r\nme than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in\r\nyonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.\r\nUnmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his\r\ncalculations\u2014coolly put into practice his plans\u2014go through the wedding\r\nceremony? Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love\r\n(which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was\r\nquite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is\r\na sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I will\r\nnever undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him\u2014not as his wife: I will\r\ntell him so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; his face\r\nturned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to his feet and\r\napproached me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am ready to go to India, if I may go free.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour answer requires a commentary,\u201d he said; \u201cit is not clear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have hitherto been my adopted brother\u2014I, your adopted sister: let us\r\ncontinue as such: you and I had better not marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe shook his head. \u201cAdopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you were my\r\nreal sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife. But as\r\nit is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it\r\ncannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan. Do you\r\nnot see it, Jane? Consider a moment\u2014your strong sense will guide you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the\r\nfact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it\r\ninferred we ought not to marry. I said so. \u201cSt. John,\u201d I returned, \u201cI regard\r\nyou as a brother\u2014you, me as a sister: so let us continue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe cannot\u2014we cannot,\u201d he answered, with short, sharp determination: \u201cit would\r\nnot do. You have said you will go with me to India: remember\u2014you have said\r\nthat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConditionally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014well. To the main point\u2014the departure with me from England, the\r\nco-operation with me in my future labours\u2014you do not object. You have already\r\nas good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it.\r\nYou have but one end to keep in view\u2014how the work you have undertaken can best\r\nbe done. Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims;\r\nmerge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect\u2014with\r\npower\u2014the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor:\r\nnot a brother\u2014that is a loose tie\u2014but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister:\r\na sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can\r\ninfluence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow\u2014his hold on my\r\nlimbs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSeek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne fitted to my purpose, you mean\u2014fitted to my vocation. Again I tell you it\r\nis not the insignificant private individual\u2014the mere man, with the man\u2019s\r\nselfish senses\u2014I wish to mate: it is the missionary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I will give the missionary my energies\u2014it is all he wants\u2014but not myself:\r\nthat would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For them he has no\r\nuse: I retain them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot\u2014you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half an\r\noblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I\r\nadvocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept on His behalf\r\na divided allegiance: it must be entire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I will give my heart to God,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not want it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm\r\nboth in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that\r\naccompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not\r\nunderstood him. He had held me in awe, because he had held me in doubt. How\r\nmuch of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but\r\nrevelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of his nature was\r\nproceeding before my eyes. I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I\r\nunderstood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that\r\nhandsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell\r\nfrom his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these\r\nqualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal\u2014one\r\nwith whom I might argue\u2014one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\r\n\n\r\nHe was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an\r\nupward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern\r\nsurprise and keen inquiry. \u201cIs she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!\u201d it\r\nseemed to say. \u201cWhat does this signify?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,\u201d he said ere long; \u201cone of\r\nwhich we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I trust, Jane, you are\r\nin earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want.\r\nOnce wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of\r\nthat Maker\u2019s spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and\r\nendeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will\r\nsee what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and\r\nmental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent\r\nconformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all\r\nminor caprices\u2014all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling\u2014all scruple\r\nabout the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination\u2014you\r\nwill hasten to enter into that union at once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I?\u201d I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their\r\nharmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow,\r\ncommanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never\r\nsoft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his wife.\r\nOh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would\r\ncross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian\r\ndeserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion\r\nand vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his\r\nineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly\r\nesteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt,\r\nattached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a\r\nstringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should still have my\r\nunblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to\r\ncommunicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which\r\nwould be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh\r\nand sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured\r\nwarrior-march trample down: but as his wife\u2014at his side always, and always\r\nrestrained, and always checked\u2014forced to keep the fire of my nature continually\r\nlow, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned\r\nflame consumed vital after vital\u2014this would be unendurable.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John!\u201d I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he answered icily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as\r\nyour wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA part of me you must become,\u201d he answered steadily; \u201cotherwise the whole\r\nbargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a\r\ngirl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we be for ever\r\ntogether\u2014sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes\u2014and unwed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said shortly; \u201cunder the circumstances, quite as well as if I\r\nwere either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to\r\nattempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. And for the\r\nrest, though you have a man\u2019s vigorous brain, you have a woman\u2019s heart and\u2014it\r\nwould not do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would do,\u201d I affirmed with some disdain, \u201cperfectly well. I have a woman\u2019s\r\nheart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade\u2019s\r\nconstancy; a fellow-soldier\u2019s frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a\r\nneophyte\u2019s respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more\u2014don\u2019t fear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is what I want,\u201d he said, speaking to himself; \u201cit is just what I want. And\r\nthere are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane, you would not\r\nrepent marrying me\u2014be certain of that; we must be married. I repeat it:\r\nthere is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon\r\nmarriage to render the union right even in your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI scorn your idea of love,\u201d I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood\r\nbefore him, leaning my back against the rock. \u201cI scorn the counterfeit\r\nsentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so. Whether\r\nhe was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he could\r\ncommand his countenance thoroughly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,\u201d he said: \u201cI think I\r\nhave done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cForgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been\r\nroused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on which our\r\nnatures are at variance\u2014a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love\r\nis an apple of discord between us. If the reality were required, what should we\r\ndo? How should we feel? My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage\u2014forget\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said he; \u201cit is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can\r\nsecure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present. To-morrow, I\r\nleave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to\r\nsay farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight\u2014take that space of time to consider\r\nmy offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but\r\nGod. Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you\r\nenter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track\r\nof selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be\r\nnumbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe had done. Turning from me, he once more\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLooked to river, looked to hill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy to hear\r\nthem uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence\r\nall he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature,\r\nwhich has met resistance where it expected submission\u2014the disapprobation of a\r\ncool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in\r\nwhich it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished\r\nto coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so\r\npatiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and\r\nrepentance.\r\n\n\r\nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even\r\nto shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I\u2014who, though I had no\r\nlove, had much friendship for him\u2014was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt\r\nthat tears started to my eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,\u201d said Diana, \u201cduring your\r\nwalk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage\r\nexpecting you\u2014he will make it up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy\r\nthan dignified; and I ran after him\u2014he stood at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, St. John,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Jane,\u201d he replied calmly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen shake hands,\u201d I added.\r\n\n\r\nWhat a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply displeased\r\nby what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him.\r\nNo happy reconciliation was to be had with him\u2014no cheering smile or generous\r\nword: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if\r\nhe forgave me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the\r\nremembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been\r\noffended.\r\n\n\r\nAnd with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me down.\r\n\n"}
{"37": "\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\r\nHe did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would. He\r\ndeferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what\r\nsevere punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can\r\ninflict on one who has offended him. Without one overt act of hostility, one\r\nupbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I\r\nwas put beyond the pale of his favour.\r\n\n\r\nNot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness\u2014not that he\r\nwould have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his power to do\r\nso. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the mean gratification of\r\nvengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love, but he had\r\nnot forgotten the words; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget\r\nthem. I saw by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on\r\nthe air between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his\r\near, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each\r\nmorning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a\r\npleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with\r\nwhat skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual,\r\nextract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval\r\nwhich had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and\r\nmanner. To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye\r\nwas a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument\u2014nothing more.\r\n\n\r\nAll this was torture to me\u2014refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire\r\nof indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me\r\naltogether. I felt how\u2014if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep\r\nsunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop\r\nof blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of\r\ncrime. Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No\r\nruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement\u2014no\r\nyearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling\r\ntears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect\r\non him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his\r\nsisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere\r\ncoldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and\r\nbanned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by\r\nmalice, but on principle.\r\n\n\r\nThe night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden about\r\nsunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now\r\nwas, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to\r\nmake a last attempt to regain his friendship. I went out and approached him as\r\nhe stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be\r\nfriends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope we are friends,\u201d was the unmoved reply; while he still watched the\r\nrising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one\r\nill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection\r\nthan that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cYour wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you\r\nas a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough. Had\r\nI attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left\r\nhim; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could. I\r\ndeeply venerated my cousin\u2019s talent and principle. His friendship was of value\r\nto me: to lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt\r\nto reconquer it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you leave\r\nme so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now turned quite from the moon and faced me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to India?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said I could not unless I married you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the\r\nice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their\r\nanger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash\r\ndown.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnce more, why this refusal?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFormerly,\u201d I answered, \u201cbecause you did not love me; now, I reply, because you\r\nalmost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis lips and cheeks turned white\u2014quite white.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should kill you\u2014I am killing you? Your words are such as ought\r\nnot to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an unfortunate\r\nstate of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that\r\nit is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven\r\ntimes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind\r\nthe trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another\r\nand far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow you will indeed hate me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is useless to attempt to conciliate\r\nyou: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the\r\ntruth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire\r\nI had whetted. I was heart-wrung.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou utterly misinterpret my words,\u201d I said, at once seizing his hand: \u201cI have\r\nno intention to grieve or pain you\u2014indeed, I have not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMost bitterly he smiled\u2014most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine. \u201cAnd now\r\nyou recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?\u201d said he,\r\nafter a considerable pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I will, as your assistant,\u201d I answered.\r\n\n\r\nA very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between Nature\r\nand Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in\r\nhis eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He spoke at last.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing\r\nto accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you in such terms as,\r\nI should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the\r\nplan. That you have done so, I regret\u2014for your sake.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once.\r\n\u201cKeep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You pretend to be\r\nshocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked: for, with your\r\nsuperior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand\r\nmy meaning. I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your\r\nwife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion perfectly.\r\nHe answered emphatically but calmly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me, then, it\r\nseems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in\r\ntown, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. Your own\r\nfortune will make you independent of the Society\u2019s aid; and thus you may still\r\nbe spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you\r\nengaged to join.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or\r\nentered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much\r\ntoo despotic for the occasion. I replied\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case. I am\r\nnot under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.\r\nWith you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a\r\nsister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I\r\nshould not live long in that climate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you are afraid of yourself,\u201d he said, curling his lip.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me\r\nwould, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover,\r\nbefore I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain\r\nwhether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I\r\nhave long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that\r\ndoubt is removed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you cherish\r\nis lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you\r\nshould blush to allude to it. You think of Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was true. I confessed it by silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to seek Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must find out what is become of him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt remains for me, then,\u201d he said, \u201cto remember you in my prayers, and to\r\nentreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a\r\ncastaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen. But God sees not\r\nas man sees: His will be done\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen. He was\r\nsoon out of sight.\r\n\n\r\nOn re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very\r\nthoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand on my\r\nshoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are always agitated and pale now. I am sure there is\r\nsomething the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands. I\r\nhave watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such\r\na spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a\r\nstrange being\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe paused\u2014I did not speak: soon she resumed\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I\r\nam sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed\r\nto any one else\u2014to what end? I wish he loved you\u2014does he, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI put her cool hand to my hot forehead; \u201cNo, Die, not one whit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone\r\nwith him, and keep you so continually at his side? Mary and I had both\r\nconcluded he wished you to marry him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe does\u2014he has asked me to be his wife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiana clapped her hands. \u201cThat is just what we hoped and thought! And you will\r\nmarry him, Jane, won\u2019t you? And then he will stay in England.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFar from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting\r\nfellow-labourer in his Indian toils.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! He wishes you to go to India?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadness!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou would not live three months there, I am certain.\r\nYou never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have refused to marry him\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd have consequently displeased him?\u201d she suggested.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDeeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as\r\nhis sister.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook\u2014one of\r\nincessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak. St.\r\nJohn\u2014you know him\u2014would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no\r\npermission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed,\r\nwhatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found\r\ncourage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot as a husband.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet he is a handsome fellow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be\r\ngrilled alive in Calcutta.\u201d And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all\r\nthoughts of going out with her brother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must indeed,\u201d I said; \u201cfor when just now I repeated the offer of serving him\r\nfor a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency. He seemed to\r\nthink I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried:\r\nas if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually\r\nregarded him as such.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you say he does not love you, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again explained that\r\nit is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He has told me I am formed\r\nfor labour\u2014not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am\r\nnot formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not\r\nbe strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a\r\nuseful tool?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cInsupportable\u2014unnatural\u2014out of the question!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d I continued, \u201cthough I have only sisterly affection for him now,\r\nyet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an\r\ninevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented;\r\nand there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and\r\nconversation. In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would\r\nnot want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible\r\nthat it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he\r\nwould.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet St. John is a good man,\u201d said Diana.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and\r\nclaims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better,\r\ntherefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress,\r\nhe should trample them down. Here he comes! I will leave you, Diana.\u201d And I\r\nhastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.\r\n\n\r\nBut I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he appeared just\r\nas composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was\r\ncertain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel\r\nshowed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed me precisely in his ordinary\r\nmanner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner\u2014one scrupulously polite.\r\nNo doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had\r\nroused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.\r\n\n\r\nFor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first chapter of\r\nRevelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the\r\nwords of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and\r\nfull\u2014never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when\r\nhe delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn\r\ntone\u2014that manner a more thrilling meaning\u2014as he sat in the midst of his\r\nhousehold circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and\r\nrendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat\r\nthere, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision\r\nof the new heaven and the new earth\u2014told how God would come to dwell with men,\r\nhow He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there\r\nshould be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because\r\nthe former things were passed away.\r\n\n\r\nThe succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially as I\r\nfelt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them,\r\nhis eye had turned on me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he\r\nshall be my son. But,\u201d was slowly, distinctly read, \u201cthe fearful, the\r\nunbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire\r\nand brimstone, which is the second death.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHenceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\r\n\n\r\nA calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his\r\nenunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader believed\r\nhis name was already written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life, and he yearned after\r\nthe hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth\r\nbring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it,\r\nbecause the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.\r\n\n\r\nIn the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered\u2014all his stern zeal\r\nwoke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest.\r\nHe supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the\r\nfold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of\r\nthe world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged,\r\nhe claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever\r\ndeeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then,\r\nwhen it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the\r\ngreatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead\r\nfor it, could not but feel it too.\r\n\n\r\nThe prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour in the\r\nmorning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room\u2014in compliance, I\r\nthink, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a\r\npleasant journey.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that\r\nspace, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I listened to human pride, I\r\nshould say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and\r\nkeep steadily in view my first aim\u2014to do all things to the glory of God. My\r\nMaster was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a\r\nvessel of wrath: repent\u2014resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid\r\nto work while it is day\u2014warned that \u2018the night cometh when no man shall work.\u2019\r\nRemember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God give you\r\nstrength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken\r\nearnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his\r\nmistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep\u2014or better,\r\nof a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible. All men of\r\ntalent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or\r\naspirants, or despots\u2014provided only they be sincere\u2014have their sublime moments,\r\nwhen they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John\u2014veneration so strong\r\nthat its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was\r\ntempted to cease struggling with him\u2014to rush down the torrent of his will into\r\nthe gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by\r\nhim now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool\r\nboth times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have\r\nyielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this hour, when\r\nI look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious\r\nof folly at the instant.\r\n\n\r\nI stood motionless under my hierophant\u2019s touch. My refusals were forgotten\u2014my\r\nfears overcome\u2014my wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible\u2014i.e., my marriage\r\nwith St. John\u2014was fast becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly with a\r\nsudden sweep. Religion called\u2014Angels beckoned\u2014God commanded\u2014life rolled\r\ntogether like a scroll\u2014death\u2019s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it\r\nseemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a\r\nsecond. The dim room was full of visions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould you decide now?\u201d asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle\r\ntones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is\r\nit than force! I could resist St. John\u2019s wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under\r\nhis kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less\r\nbe made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed\r\nby one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could decide if I were but certain,\u201d I answered: \u201cwere I but convinced that\r\nit is God\u2019s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now\u2014come\r\nafterwards what would!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy prayers are heard!\u201d ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer on my\r\nhead, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if\r\nhe loved me (I say almost\u2014I knew the difference\u2014for I had felt what it\r\nwas to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and\r\nthought only of duty). I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before\r\nwhich clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was\r\nright; and only that. \u201cShow me, show me the path!\u201d I entreated of Heaven. I was\r\nexcited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of\r\nexcitement the reader shall judge.\r\n\n\r\nAll the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were\r\nnow retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was full of\r\nmoonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb. Suddenly it stood\r\nstill to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once\r\nto my head and extremities. The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it\r\nwas quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their\r\nutmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned\r\nand forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh\r\nquivered on my bones.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you heard? What do you see?\u201d asked St. John. I saw nothing, but I\r\nheard a voice somewhere cry\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane! Jane! Jane!\u201d\u2014nothing more.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cO God! what is it?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\n\r\nI might have said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d for it did not seem in the room\u2014nor in the\r\nhouse\u2014nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air\u2014nor from under the\r\nearth\u2014nor from overhead. I had heard it\u2014where, or whence, for ever impossible\r\nto know! And it was the voice of a human being\u2014a known, loved, well-remembered\r\nvoice\u2014that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly,\r\neerily, urgently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am coming!\u201d I cried. \u201cWait for me! Oh, I will come!\u201d I flew to the door and\r\nlooked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the garden: it was void.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\n\r\nThe hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back\u2014\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I\r\nlistened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and\r\nmidnight hush.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDown superstition!\u201d I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black\r\nyew at the gate. \u201cThis is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work\r\nof nature. She was roused, and did\u2014no miracle\u2014but her best.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It was\r\nmy time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and in\r\nforce. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I\r\nmust and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy to command\r\nwell enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in;\r\nfell on my knees; and prayed in my way\u2014a different way to St. John\u2019s, but\r\neffective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit;\r\nand my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the\r\nthanksgiving\u2014took a resolve\u2014and lay down, unscared, enlightened\u2014eager but for\r\nthe daylight.\r\n\n"}
{"38": "\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\r\nThe daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two with\r\narranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein\r\nI should wish to leave them during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John\r\nquit his room. He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock\u2014no, but a slip of\r\npaper was passed under the door. I took it up. It bore these words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little longer, you\r\nwould have laid your hand on the Christian\u2019s cross and the angel\u2019s crown. I\r\nshall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight. Meantime,\r\nwatch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is\r\nwilling, but the flesh, I see, is weak. I shall pray for you hourly.\u2014Yours,\r\nST. JOHN.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy spirit,\u201d I answered mentally, \u201cis willing to do what is right; and my\r\nflesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once\r\nthat will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be strong enough to\r\nsearch\u2014inquire\u2014to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open\r\nday of certainty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat\r\nfast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass out.\r\nLooking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He took the way over\r\nthe misty moors in the direction of Whitcross\u2014there he would meet the coach.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,\u201d thought I: \u201cI\r\ntoo have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to see and ask after in\r\nEngland, before I depart for ever.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking\r\nsoftly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans\r\ntheir present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I\r\ncould recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I\r\nhad heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in\r\nme\u2014not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression\u2014a\r\ndelusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The\r\nwondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\r\nfoundations of Paul and Silas\u2019s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul\u2019s\r\ncell and loosed its bands\u2014it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang\r\ntrembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear,\r\nand in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook,\r\nbut exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged\r\nto make, independent of the cumbrous body.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEre many days,\u201d I said, as I terminated my musings, \u201cI will know something of\r\nhim whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no\r\navail\u2014personal inquiry shall replace them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and\r\nshould be absent at least four days.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlone, Jane?\u201d they asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time\r\nbeen uneasy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had believed\r\nme to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so; but,\r\nwith their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment, except that\r\nDiana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale,\r\nshe observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I\r\nhoped soon to alleviate.\r\n\n\r\nIt was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no\r\ninquiries\u2014no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not now be\r\nexplicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with\r\nwhich I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free action I should\r\nunder similar circumstances have accorded them.\r\n\n\r\nI left Moor House at three o\u2019clock P.M., and soon after four I\r\nstood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the\r\ncoach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of those\r\nsolitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. It\r\nwas the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on\r\nthis very spot\u2014how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I\r\nbeckoned. I entered\u2014not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price\r\nof its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the\r\nmessenger-pigeon flying home.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a\r\nTuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach\r\nstopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery\r\nwhose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature\r\nand verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met\r\nmy eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character\r\nof this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow far is Thornfield Hall from here?\u201d I asked of the ostler.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust two miles, ma\u2019am, across the fields.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy journey is closed,\u201d I thought to myself. I got out of the coach, gave a box\r\nI had into the ostler\u2019s charge, to be kept till I called for it; paid my fare;\r\nsatisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign\r\nof the inn, and I read in gilt letters, \u201cThe Rochester Arms.\u201d My heart leapt\r\nup: I was already on my master\u2019s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck\r\nit:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and\r\nthen, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is\r\nthere? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not\r\nspeak to him or seek his presence. You have lost your labour\u2014you had better go\r\nno farther,\u201d urged the monitor. \u201cAsk information of the people at the inn; they\r\ncan give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that\r\nman, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on it. I\r\nso dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong doubt was to\r\nprolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star.\r\nThere was the stile before me\u2014the very fields through which I had hurried,\r\nblind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on\r\nthe morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved\r\nto take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes!\r\nHow I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what\r\nfeelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and\r\nhill between them!\r\n\n\r\nAt last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the\r\nmorning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. Another field\r\ncrossed\u2014a lane threaded\u2014and there were the courtyard walls\u2014the back offices:\r\nthe house itself, the rookery still hid. \u201cMy first view of it shall be in\r\nfront,\u201d I determined, \u201cwhere its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at\r\nonce, and where I can single out my master\u2019s very window: perhaps he will be\r\nstanding at it\u2014he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on\r\nthe pavement in front. Could I but see him!\u2014but a moment! Surely, in that case,\r\nI should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell\u2014I am not certain. And if\r\nI did\u2014what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more\r\ntasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps at this moment he is\r\nwatching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard\u2014turned its angle: there was a\r\ngate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by\r\nstone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full\r\nfront of the mansion. I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain\r\nif any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long\r\nfront\u2014all from this sheltered station were at my command.\r\n\n\r\nThe crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey. I\r\nwonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very careful and\r\ntimid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and\r\nthen a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into\r\nthe meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a\r\nprotracted, hardy gaze towards it. \u201cWhat affectation of diffidence was this at\r\nfirst?\u201d they might have demanded; \u201cwhat stupid regardlessness now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHear an illustration, reader.\r\n\n\r\nA lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse\r\nof her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the grass, careful\r\nto make no sound; he pauses\u2014fancying she has stirred: he withdraws: not for\r\nworlds would he be seen. All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a\r\nlight veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes\r\nanticipate the vision of beauty\u2014warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How\r\nhurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he\r\nsuddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment\r\nsince, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,\r\nand gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no\r\nlonger fears to waken by any sound he can utter\u2014by any movement he can make. He\r\nthought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.\r\n\n\r\nI looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.\r\n\n\r\nNo need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!\u2014to peep up at chamber lattices,\r\nfearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for doors opening\u2014to\r\nfancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The lawn, the grounds were\r\ntrodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front was, as I had once seen it\r\nin a dream, but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking,\r\nperforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys\u2014all had\r\ncrashed in.\r\n\n\r\nAnd there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome wild.\r\nNo wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer:\r\nas well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of\r\nthe stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen\u2014by conflagration: but how\r\nkindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and\r\nmarble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as\r\nproperty? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer\r\nit\u2014not even dumb sign, mute token.\r\n\n\r\nIn wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I\r\ngathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence. Winter snows, I\r\nthought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those\r\nhollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had\r\ncherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and\r\nfallen rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In\r\nwhat land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey\r\nchurch tower near the gates, and I asked, \u201cIs he with Damer de Rochester,\r\nsharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSome answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but at the\r\ninn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought my breakfast\r\ninto the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit down: I had some\r\nquestions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such\r\nhorror had I of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had\r\njust left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a\r\nrespectable-looking, middle-aged man.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know Thornfield Hall, of course?\u201d I managed to say at last.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am; I lived there once.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you?\u201d Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was the late Mr. Rochester\u2019s butler,\u201d he added.\r\n\n\r\nThe late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been trying\r\nto evade.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe late!\u201d I gasped. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward\u2019s father,\u201d he explained. I breathed\r\nagain: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words that Mr.\r\nEdward\u2014my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)\u2014was at least\r\nalive: was, in short, \u201cthe present gentleman.\u201d Gladdening words! It seemed I\r\ncould hear all that was to come\u2014whatever the disclosures might be\u2014with\r\ncomparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I\r\nthought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?\u201d I asked, knowing, of course,\r\nwhat the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as\r\nto where he really was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am\u2014oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in\r\nthese parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,\u2014Thornfield Hall\r\nis quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful\r\ncalamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any\r\nof the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and\r\nbefore the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.\r\nIt was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt dead of night!\u201d I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at\r\nThornfield. \u201cWas it known how it originated?\u201d I demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey guessed, ma\u2019am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained\r\nbeyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,\u201d he continued, edging his chair a\r\nlittle nearer the table, and speaking low, \u201cthat there was a lady\u2014a\u2014a lunatic,\r\nkept in the house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have heard something of it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was kept in very close confinement, ma\u2019am; people even for some years was\r\nnot absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by\r\nrumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was\r\ndifficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and\r\nsome believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year\r\nsince\u2014a very queer thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the main\r\nfact.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd this lady?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis lady, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered, \u201cturned out to be Mr. Rochester\u2019s wife! The\r\ndiscovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a\r\ngoverness at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the fire,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to that, ma\u2019am\u2014that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say\r\nthey never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually.\r\nThey used to watch him\u2014servants will, you know, ma\u2019am\u2014and he set store on her\r\npast everything: for all, nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was\r\na little small thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself;\r\nbut I\u2019ve heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough.\r\nMr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when\r\ngentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they\r\nwere bewitched. Well, he would marry her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall tell me this part of the story another time,\u201d I said; \u201cbut now I\r\nhave a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. Was it\r\nsuspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it, ma\u2019am: it\u2019s quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her,\r\nthat set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole\u2014an\r\nable woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault\u2014a fault common\r\nto a deal of them nurses and matrons\u2014she kept a private bottle of gin by\r\nher, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a\r\nhard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast\r\nasleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch,\r\nwould take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go\r\nroaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They\r\nsay she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don\u2019t know about\r\nthat. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room\r\nnext her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the\r\nchamber that had been the governess\u2019s\u2014(she was like as if she knew somehow how\r\nmatters had gone on, and had a spite at her)\u2014and she kindled the bed there; but\r\nthere was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately. The governess had run away two\r\nmonths before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most\r\nprecious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he\r\ngrew savage\u2014quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he\r\ngot dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent Mrs. Fairfax,\r\nthe housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely,\r\nfor he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it\u2014she was a very\r\ngood woman. Miss Ad\u00e8le, a ward he had, was put to school. He broke off\r\nacquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the\r\nHall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! did he not leave England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of the house,\r\nexcept at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the\r\norchard as if he had lost his senses\u2014which it is my opinion he had; for a more\r\nspirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess\r\ncrossed him, you never saw, ma\u2019am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or\r\nracing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and\r\na will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my\r\npart, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she\r\ncame to Thornfield Hall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above\r\nand below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself,\r\nand went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And then they called out to\r\nhim that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above\r\nthe battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw\r\nher and heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black\r\nhair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed,\r\nand several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to\r\nthe roof; we heard him call \u2018Bertha!\u2019 We saw him approach her; and then, ma\u2019am,\r\nshe yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the\r\npavement.\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cDead?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were scattered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may well say so, ma\u2019am: it was frightful!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe shuddered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d I urged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some\r\nbits of walls standing now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere any other lives lost?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014perhaps it would have been better if there had.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor Mr. Edward!\u201d he ejaculated, \u201cI little thought ever to have seen it! Some\r\nsay it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and\r\nwanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my\r\npart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said he was alive?\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? How?\u201d My blood was again running cold. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIs he\r\nin England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy\u2014ay\u2014he\u2019s in England; he can\u2019t get out of England, I fancy\u2014he\u2019s a fixture\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is stone-blind,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYes, he is stone-blind, is Mr. Edward.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to ask what\r\nhad caused this calamity.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way, ma\u2019am:\r\nhe wouldn\u2019t leave the house till every one else was out before him. As he came\r\ndown the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from\r\nthe battlements, there was a great crash\u2014all fell. He was taken out from under\r\nthe ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect\r\nhim partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr.\r\nCarter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he\r\nlost the sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed\u2014blind and a cripple.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he? Where does he now live?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off: quite a\r\ndesolate spot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is with him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOld John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken down, they\r\nsay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you any sort of conveyance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe have a chaise, ma\u2019am, a very handsome chaise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to Ferndean\r\nbefore dark this day, I\u2019ll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually\r\ndemand.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"39": "\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\r\nThe manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate\r\nsize, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. I had heard of\r\nit before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His\r\nfather had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have\r\nlet the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and\r\ninsalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the\r\nexception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the\r\nsquire when he went there in the season to shoot.\r\n\n\r\nTo this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics\r\nof sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain. The last mile I\r\nperformed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double\r\nremuneration I had promised. Even when within a very short distance of the\r\nmanor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of\r\nthe gloomy wood about it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to\r\nenter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of\r\nclose-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle\r\nbetween hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it,\r\nexpecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far\r\nand farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.\r\n\n\r\nI thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of\r\nnatural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round in search of\r\nanother road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense\r\nsummer foliage\u2014no opening anywhere.\r\n\n\r\nI proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I\r\nbeheld a railing, then the house\u2014scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable\r\nfrom the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal,\r\nfastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which\r\nthe wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds;\r\nonly a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame\r\nof the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows\r\nwere latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.\r\nThe whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, \u201cquite a desolate\r\nspot.\u201d It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the\r\nforest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan there be life here?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\nYes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement\u2014that narrow front-door\r\nwas unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.\r\n\n\r\nIt opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a\r\nman without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.\r\nDusk as it was, I had recognised him\u2014it was my master, Edward Fairfax\r\nRochester, and no other.\r\n\n\r\nI stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him\u2014to examine him,\r\nmyself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in\r\nwhich rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in\r\nrestraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.\r\n\n\r\nHis form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was\r\nstill erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or\r\nsunk: not in one year\u2019s space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be\r\nquelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his countenance I saw a change:\r\nthat looked desperate and brooding\u2014that reminded me of some wronged and\r\nfettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged\r\neagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked\r\nthat sightless Samson.\r\n\n\r\nAnd, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?\u2014if you do, you\r\nlittle know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I should dare to\r\ndrop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath\r\nit: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.\r\n\n\r\nHe descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the\r\ngrass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if he knew not\r\nwhich way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and\r\nwith a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one\r\nsaw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left\r\narm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by\r\ntouch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the\r\ntrees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded\r\nhis arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his\r\nuncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some quarter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you take my arm, sir?\u201d he said; \u201cthere is a heavy shower coming on: had\r\nyou not better go in?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me alone,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\nJohn withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk\r\nabout: vainly,\u2014all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and,\r\nre-entering it, closed the door.\r\n\n\r\nI now drew near and knocked: John\u2019s wife opened for me. \u201cMary,\u201d I said, \u201chow\r\nare you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried \u201cIs it\r\nreally you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?\u201d I answered by\r\ntaking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat\r\nby a good fire. I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which\r\nhad happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester.\r\nI asked John to go down to the turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the\r\nchaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed\r\nmy bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at\r\nthe Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect,\r\nthough difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay. Just\r\nat this moment the parlour-bell rang.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen you go in,\u201d said I, \u201ctell your master that a person wishes to speak to\r\nhim, but do not give my name.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will see you,\u201d she answered; \u201che refuses everybody.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen she returned, I inquired what he had said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are to send in your name and your business,\u201d she replied. She then\r\nproceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together with\r\ncandles.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that what he rang for?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive the tray to me; I will carry it in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray shook as\r\nI held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my ribs loud and\r\nfast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.\r\n\n\r\nThis parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate;\r\nand, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned\r\nmantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on\r\none side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being\r\ninadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he\r\njumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked\r\nthe tray from my hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said\r\nsoftly, \u201cLie down!\u201d Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what the\r\ncommotion was: but as he saw nothing, he returned and sighed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive me the water, Mary,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\nI approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still\r\nexcited.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDown, Pilot!\u201d I again said. He checked the water on its way to his lips, and\r\nseemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. \u201cThis is you, Mary, is it\r\nnot?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMary is in the kitchen,\u201d I answered.\r\n\n\r\nHe put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he did\r\nnot touch me. \u201cWho is this? Who is this?\u201d he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to\r\nsee with those sightless eyes\u2014unavailing and distressing attempt!\r\n\u201cAnswer me\u2014speak again!\u201d he ordered, imperiously and aloud.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the\r\nglass,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is it? What is it? Who speaks?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening,\u201d I\r\nanswered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGreat God!\u2014what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo delusion\u2014no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your\r\nhealth too sound for frenzy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I\r\nmust feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever\u2014whoever you\r\nare\u2014be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHer very fingers!\u201d he cried; \u201cher small, slight fingers! If so there must be\r\nmore of her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my\r\nshoulder\u2014neck\u2014waist\u2014I was entwined and gathered to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it Jane? What is it? This is her shape\u2014this is her size\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd this her voice,\u201d I added. \u201cShe is all here: her heart, too. God bless you,\r\nsir! I am glad to be so near you again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane Eyre!\u2014Jane Eyre,\u201d was all he said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear master,\u201d I answered, \u201cI am Jane Eyre: I have found you out\u2014I am come\r\nback to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn truth?\u2014in the flesh? My living Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou touch me, sir,\u2014you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse,\r\nnor vacant like air, am I?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her features; but\r\nI cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have\r\nhad at night when I have clasped her once more to my heart, as I do now; and\r\nkissed her, as thus\u2014and felt that she loved me, and trusted that she would not\r\nleave me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich I never will, sir, from this day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty mockery;\r\nand I was desolate and abandoned\u2014my life dark, lonely, hopeless\u2014my soul athirst\r\nand forbidden to drink\u2014my heart famished and never to be fed. Gentle, soft\r\ndream, nestling in my arms now, you will fly, too, as your sisters have all\r\nfled before you: but kiss me before you go\u2014embrace me, Jane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, sir\u2014and there!\u201d\u2019\r\n\n\r\nI pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes\u2014I swept his hair\r\nfrom his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to arouse himself: the\r\nconviction of the reality of all this seized him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is you\u2014is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are not a\r\npining outcast amongst strangers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir! I am an independent woman now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndependent! What do you mean, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! this is practical\u2014this is real!\u201d he cried: \u201cI should never dream that.\r\nBesides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as\r\nwell as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.\u2014What, Janet!\r\nAre you an independent woman? A rich woman?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite rich, sir. If you won\u2019t let me live with you, I can build a house of my\r\nown close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want\r\ncompany of an evening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after\r\nyou, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will stay with me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly\u2014unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your\r\nhousekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion\u2014to read to you, to\r\nwalk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you.\r\nCease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so\r\nlong as I live.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe replied not: he seemed serious\u2014abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened his\r\nlips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps\r\nI had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw\r\nimpropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the\r\nidea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the\r\nless certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at\r\nonce as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance\r\nbecoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong,\r\nand was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw\r\nmyself from his arms\u2014but he eagerly snatched me closer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014Jane; you must not go. No\u2014I have touched you, heard you, felt the\r\ncomfort of your presence\u2014the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot give up\r\nthese joys. I have little left in myself\u2014I must have you. The world may\r\nlaugh\u2014may call me absurd, selfish\u2014but it does not signify. My very soul demands\r\nyou: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another.\r\nYou, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair\u2014to wait on\r\nme as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous\r\nspirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought\r\nto suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly\r\nfeelings for you: do you think so? Come\u2014tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you\r\nthink it better.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young\u2014you must marry one\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about being married.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you\r\ncare\u2014but\u2014a sightless block!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and\r\ntook fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the\r\ndifficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from\r\nmy previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of conversation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,\u201d said I, parting his thick\r\nand long uncut locks; \u201cfor I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or\r\nsomething of that sort. You have a \u2018faux air\u2019 of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields\r\nabout you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles\u2019 feathers; whether\r\nyour nails are grown like birds\u2019 claws or not, I have not yet noticed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,\u201d he said, drawing the mutilated\r\nlimb from his breast, and showing it to me. \u201cIt is a mere stump\u2014a ghastly\r\nsight! Don\u2019t you think so, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes\u2014and the scar of fire on\r\nyour forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well\r\nfor all this; and making too much of you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my cicatrised\r\nvisage.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you? Don\u2019t tell me so\u2014lest I should say something disparaging to your\r\njudgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the\r\nhearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; with the right eye I see a glow\u2014a ruddy haze.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you see the candles?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery dimly\u2014each is a luminous cloud.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan you see me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen do you take supper?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never take supper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay, only you\r\nforget.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSummoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him,\r\nlikewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and\r\nease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time after. There was no\r\nharassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for with him\r\nI was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed\r\neither to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life\r\nand light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in\r\nmine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead:\r\nhis lineaments softened and warmed.\r\n\n\r\nAfter supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been, what I\r\nhad been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very partial\r\nreplies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night. Besides, I\r\nwished to touch no deep-thrilling chord\u2014to open no fresh well of emotion in his\r\nheart: my sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was:\r\nand yet but by fits. If a moment\u2019s silence broke the conversation, he would\r\nturn restless, touch me, then say, \u201cJane.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u201cI conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my\r\nlone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and\r\nit was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John\u2019s wife to answer me,\r\nand your voice spoke at my ear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I had come in, in Mary\u2019s stead, with the tray.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can\r\ntell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?\r\nDoing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the\r\nsensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat:\r\nand then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold\r\nmy Jane again. Yes: for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of my\r\nlost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she\r\nnot depart as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no\r\nmore.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas,\r\nwas, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind. I\r\npassed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and\r\nthat I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as\r\never.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some\r\nfatal moment, you will again desert me\u2014passing like a shadow, whither and how\r\nto me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you a pocket-comb about you, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat for, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I\r\nexamine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are\r\nmore like a brownie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I hideous, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery, sir: you always were, you know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHumph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have\r\nsojourned.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better\r\npeople; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite\r\nmore refined and exalted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho the deuce have you been with?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and\r\nthen I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho have you been with, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till to-morrow; to\r\nleave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall\r\nappear at your breakfast table to finish it. By the bye, I must mind not to\r\nrise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the\r\nleast, to say nothing of fried ham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou mocking changeling\u2014fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as I have\r\nnot felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his David, the\r\nevil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I\u2019ll leave you: I have been\r\ntravelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired. Good night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. \u201cA good idea!\u201d\r\nI thought with glee. \u201cI see I have the means of fretting him out of his\r\nmelancholy for some time to come.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nVery early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one room\r\nto another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: \u201cIs Miss Eyre\r\nhere?\u201d Then: \u201cWhich room did you put her into? Was it dry? Is she up? Go and\r\nask if she wants anything; and when she will come down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast. Entering\r\nthe room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my presence. It\r\nwas mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a\r\ncorporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair\u2014still, but not at rest: expectant\r\nevidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His\r\ncountenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit\u2014and alas! it\r\nwas not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was\r\ndependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but\r\nthe powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I\r\naccosted him with what vivacity I could.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a bright, sunny morning, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cThe rain is over and gone, and\r\nthere is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had wakened the glow: his features beamed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone: not\r\nvanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but\r\nits song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays. All the\r\nmelody on earth is concentrated in my Jane\u2019s tongue to my ear (I am glad it is\r\nnot naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as if a\r\nroyal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a sparrow to\r\nbecome its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt\r\ndrops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.\r\n\n\r\nMost of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet and\r\nwild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how brilliantly green\r\nthey were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue\r\nwas the sky. I sought a seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump\r\nof a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why\r\nshould I, when both he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us:\r\nall was quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had\r\nfled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining\r\nyour apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which\r\ncould serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in\r\nits little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been\r\nprepared for the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute\r\nand penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I\r\nsoftened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and\r\nstarvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary\r\npain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I wished.\r\n\n\r\nI should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my way: I\r\nshould have told him my intention. I should have confided in him: he would\r\nnever have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he had seemed in his\r\ndespair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute\r\nhimself my tyrant: he would have given me half his fortune, without demanding\r\nso much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless\r\non the wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed to\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,\u201d I answered: and\r\nthen I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at Moor House; how I had\r\nobtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The accession of fortune, the\r\ndiscovery of my relations, followed in due order. Of course, St. John Rivers\u2019\r\nname came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name\r\nwas immediately taken up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis St. John, then, is your cousin?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have spoken of him often: do you like him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what\r\ndoes it mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt John was only twenty-nine, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jeune encore,\u2019 as the French say. Is he a person of low stature,\r\nphlegmatic, and plain? A person whose goodness consists rather in his\r\nguiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to\r\nperform.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you shrug your\r\nshoulders to hear him talk?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point. His brain is\r\nfirst-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he an able man, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTruly able.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA thoroughly educated man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?\u2014priggish and parsonic?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they must\r\nsuit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis appearance,\u2014I forget what description you gave of his appearance;\u2014a sort\r\nof raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted up on his\r\nthick-soled high-lows, eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a\r\nGrecian profile.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(Aside.) \u201cDamn him!\u201d\u2014(To me.) \u201cDid you like him, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had got hold of\r\nhim: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him respite from the\r\ngnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore, immediately charm the\r\nsnake.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?\u201d was the\r\nnext somewhat unexpected observation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming\r\ncontrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: he is\r\npresent to your imagination,\u2014tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile.\r\nYour eyes dwell on a Vulcan,\u2014a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and\r\nblind and lame into the bargain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can leave me, ma\u2019am: but before you go\u201d (and he retained me by a\r\nfirmer grasp than ever), \u201cyou will be pleased just to answer me a question or\r\ntwo.\u201d He paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat questions, Mr. Rochester?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen followed this cross-examination.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSt. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his\r\ncousin?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDaily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for you are\r\na talented creature!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe approved of them\u2014yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find? Some\r\nof your accomplishments are not ordinary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to\r\nsee you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow and then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf an evening?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was\r\ndiscovered?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFive months.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and\r\nwe by the table.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he study much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good deal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHindostanee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do meantime?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI learnt German, at first.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he teach you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe did not understand German.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he teach you nothing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little Hindostanee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRivers taught you Hindostanee?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd his sisters also?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you ask to learn?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wished to teach you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA second pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe intended me to go with him to India.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe asked me to marry him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is a fiction\u2014an impudent invention to vex me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and\r\nwas as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the same\r\nthing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given\r\nyou notice to quit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I am comfortable there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it\r\nis with this cousin\u2014this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I thought my little\r\nJane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was\r\nan atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I\r\nhave wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her,\r\nshe was loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and\r\nmarry Rivers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShake me off, then, sir,\u2014push me away, for I\u2019ll not leave you of my own\r\naccord.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so\r\ntruthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have\r\nformed a new tie. But I am not a fool\u2014go\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere must I go, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour own way\u2014with the husband you have chosen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know\u2014this St. John Rivers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not love\r\nhim. He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you love) a beautiful\r\nyoung lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only because he thought I\r\nshould make a suitable missionary\u2019s wife, which she would not have done. He is\r\ngood and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like\r\nyou, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no\r\nindulgence for me\u2014no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even\r\nyouth\u2014only a few useful mental points.\u2014Then I must leave you, sir, to go to\r\nhim?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but\r\nbeloved master. He smiled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and\r\nRivers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a little\r\nto make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you\r\nwish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would\r\nbe proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with\r\nyou it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for\r\never.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy seared vision! My crippled strength!\u201d he murmured regretfully.\r\n\n\r\nI caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and wanted\r\nto speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a minute, I saw a\r\ntear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek. My\r\nheart swelled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield\r\norchard,\u201d he remarked ere long. \u201cAnd what right would that ruin have to bid a\r\nbudding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are no ruin, sir\u2014no lightning-struck tree: you are green and vigorous.\r\nPlants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they\r\ntake delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow they will lean towards\r\nyou, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain he smiled: I gave him comfort.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou speak of friends, Jane?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, of friends,\u201d I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than\r\nfriends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! Jane. But I want a wife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: is it news to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course: you said nothing about it before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it unwelcome news?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat depends on circumstances, sir\u2014on your choice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChoose then, sir\u2014her who loves you best.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will at least choose\u2014her I love best. Jane, will you marry me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTruly, Jane?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMost truly, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life\u2014if ever I thought a good\r\nthought\u2014if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer\u2014if ever I wished a\r\nrighteous wish,\u2014I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy\r\nas I can be on earth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you delight in sacrifice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. To\r\nbe privileged to put my arms round what I value\u2014to press my lips to what I\r\nlove\u2014to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then\r\ncertainly I delight in sacrifice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really be useful\r\nto you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained\r\nevery part but that of the giver and protector.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHitherto I have hated to be helped\u2014to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate\r\nit no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling\u2019s, but it is pleasant\r\nto feel it circled by Jane\u2019s little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to\r\nthe constant attendance of servants; but Jane\u2019s soft ministry will be a\r\nperpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo the finest fibre of my nature, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be\r\nmarried instantly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the licence to\r\nget\u2014then we marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its\r\nmeridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look at your\r\nwatch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no use for\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is nearly four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, sir. Don\u2019t you feel hungry?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine clothes\r\nand jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it is quite\r\nhot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened\r\nround my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since the day I lost my\r\nonly treasure, as a memento of her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with\r\ngratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees not as man\r\nsees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did\r\nwrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower\u2014breathed guilt on its purity:\r\nthe Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost\r\ncursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine\r\njustice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass\r\nthrough the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty;\r\nand one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my\r\nstrength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as\r\na child does its weakness? Of late, Jane\u2014only\u2014only of late\u2014I began to see and\r\nacknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse,\r\nrepentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray:\r\nvery brief prayers they were, but very sincere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome days since: nay, I can number them\u2014four; it was last Monday night, a\r\nsingular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy\u2014sorrow,\r\nsullenness. I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you,\r\nyou must be dead. Late that night\u2014perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve\r\no\u2019clock\u2014ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed\r\ngood to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world\r\nto come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me\r\nto feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague,\r\nluminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I\r\nlonged for thee both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish\r\nand humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and\r\nmight not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I\r\nacknowledged\u2014that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and\r\nomega of my heart\u2019s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words\u2014\u2018Jane!\r\nJane! Jane!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you speak these words aloud?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I\r\npronounced them with such frantic energy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point.\r\nYou will think me superstitious,\u2014some superstition I have in my blood, and\r\nalways had: nevertheless, this is true\u2014true at least it is that I heard what I\r\nnow relate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs I exclaimed \u2018Jane! Jane! Jane!\u2019 a voice\u2014I cannot tell whence the voice\r\ncame, but I know whose voice it was\u2014replied, \u2018I am coming: wait for me;\u2019 and a\r\nmoment after, went whispering on the wind the words\u2014\u2018Where are you?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind:\r\nyet it is difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as\r\nyou see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.\r\n\u2018Where are you?\u2019 seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo\r\nrepeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my\r\nbrow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were\r\nmeeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt were, at that\r\nhour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to\r\ncomfort mine; for those were your accents\u2014as certain as I live\u2014they were\r\nyours!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReader, it was on Monday night\u2014near midnight\u2014that I too had received the\r\nmysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it. I\r\nlistened to Mr. Rochester\u2019s narrative, but made no disclosure in return. The\r\ncoincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or\r\ndiscussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a\r\nprofound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its\r\nsufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.\r\nI kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot now wonder,\u201d continued my master, \u201cthat when you rose upon me so\r\nunexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a\r\nmere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation,\r\nas the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before. Now, I thank God!\r\nI know it to be otherwise. Yes, I thank God!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and\r\nbending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion. Only the\r\nlast words of the worship were audible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I\r\nhumbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life\r\nthan I have done hitherto!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a\r\nmoment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of\r\nstature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We entered the wood, and\r\nwended homeward.\r\n\n"}
{"40": "\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\u2014CONCLUSION\n\r\nReader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk,\r\nwere alone present. When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of\r\nthe manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the\r\nknives, and I said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.\u201d The housekeeper and\r\nher husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one\r\nmay at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring\r\nthe danger of having one\u2019s ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and\r\nsubsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and\r\nshe did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens\r\nroasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for\r\nthe same space of time John\u2019s knives also had rest from the polishing process:\r\nbut Mary, bending again over the roast, said only\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you, Miss? Well, for sure!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA short time after she pursued\u2014\u201cI seed you go out with the master, but I didn\u2019t\r\nknow you were gone to church to be wed;\u201d and she basted away. John, when I\r\nturned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI telled Mary how it would be,\u201d he said: \u201cI knew what Mr. Edward\u201d (John was an\r\nold servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house,\r\ntherefore, he often gave him his Christian name)\u2014\u201cI knew what Mr. Edward would\r\ndo; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he\u2019s done right, for\r\naught I know. I wish you joy, Miss!\u201d and he politely pulled his forelock.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.\u201d I put into\r\nhis hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen.\r\nIn passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll happen do better for him nor ony o\u2019 t\u2019 grand ladies.\u201d And again, \u201cIf\r\nshe ben\u2019t one o\u2019 th\u2019 handsomest, she\u2019s noan fa\u00e2l and varry good-natured; and i\u2019\r\nhis een she\u2019s fair beautiful, onybody may see that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done:\r\nfully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary approved the step\r\nunreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the\r\nhoneymoon, and then she would come and see me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe had better not wait till then, Jane,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, when I read her\r\nletter to him; \u201cif she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine\r\nour life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow St. John received the news, I don\u2019t know: he never answered the letter in\r\nwhich I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however,\r\nmentioning Mr. Rochester\u2019s name or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then\r\ncalm, and, though very serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not\r\nfrequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not\r\nof those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.\r\n\n\r\nYou have not quite forgotten little Ad\u00e8le, have you, reader? I had not; I soon\r\nasked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school\r\nwhere he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.\r\nShe looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy. I found the rules of the\r\nestablishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of\r\nher age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more,\r\nbut I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by\r\nanother\u2014my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a\r\nmore indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and\r\nbringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything\r\nthat could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became\r\nvery happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a\r\nsound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and\r\nwhen she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile,\r\ngood-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine,\r\nshe has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to\r\noffer her.\r\n\n\r\nMy tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life,\r\nand one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently\r\nrecurred in this narrative, and I have done.\r\n\n\r\nI have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and\r\nwith what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest\u2014blest beyond what\r\nlanguage can express; because I am my husband\u2019s life as fully as he is mine. No\r\nwoman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his\r\nbone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward\u2019s society: he\r\nknows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that\r\nbeats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be\r\ntogether is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.\r\nWe talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated\r\nand an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his\r\nconfidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character\u2014perfect\r\nconcord is the result.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was\r\nthat circumstance that drew us so very near\u2014that knit us so very close: for I\r\nwas then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what he\r\noften called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature\u2014he saw books through me;\r\nand never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the\r\neffect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam\u2014of the landscape before us;\r\nof the weather round us\u2014and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no\r\nlonger stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary\r\nof conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be\r\ndone. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even\r\nthough sad\u2014because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping\r\nhumiliation. He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by\r\nmy attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was\r\nto indulge my sweetest wishes.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his\r\ndictation, he came and bent over me, and said\u2014\u201cJane, have you a glittering\r\nornament round your neck?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had a gold watch-chain: I answered \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you a pale blue dress on?\u201d\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nI had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity\r\nclouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.\r\n\n\r\nHe and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he\r\neventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now see very\r\ndistinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being\r\nled by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him\u2014the earth no longer a\r\nvoid. When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had\r\ninherited his own eyes, as they once were\u2014large, brilliant, and black. On that\r\noccasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered\r\njudgment with mercy.\r\n\n\r\nMy Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love\r\nare happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once\r\nevery year, they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana\u2019s husband is a\r\ncaptain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary\u2019s is a clergyman, a\r\ncollege friend of her brother\u2019s, and, from his attainments and principles,\r\nworthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their\r\nwives, and are loved by them.\r\n\n\r\nAs to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the\r\npath he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute,\r\nindefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful,\r\nand devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he\r\nclears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the\r\nprejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be\r\nexacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior\r\nGreatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His\r\nis the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he\r\nsays\u2014\u201cWhosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross\r\nand follow me.\u201d His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to\r\nfill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth\u2014who\r\nstand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty\r\nvictories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\r\n\n\r\nSt. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed\r\nto the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its\r\nsetting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and\r\nyet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his\r\nincorruptible crown. I know that a stranger\u2019s hand will write to me next, to\r\nsay that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy\r\nof his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John\u2019s\r\nlast hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope\r\nwill be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Master,\u201d he says, \u201chas forewarned me. Daily He announces more\r\ndistinctly,\u2014\u2018Surely I come quickly!\u2019 and hourly I more eagerly respond,\u2014\u2018Amen;\r\neven so come, Lord Jesus!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n"}

INTRODUCTORY.\r\n    \n\r\n      THE other day, in looking over my papers, I found in my desk the following\r\n      copy of a letter, sent by me a year since to an old school acquaintance:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDEAR CHARLES,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI think when you and I were at Eton together, we were neither of us what\r\n      could be called popular characters: you were a sarcastic, observant,\r\n      shrewd, cold-blooded creature; my own portrait I will not attempt to draw,\r\n      but I cannot recollect that it was a strikingly attractive one\u2014can\r\n      you? What animal magnetism drew thee and me together I know not; certainly\r\n      I never experienced anything of the Pylades and Orestes sentiment for you,\r\n      and I have reason to believe that you, on your part, were equally free\r\n      from all romantic regard to me. Still, out of school hours we walked and\r\n      talked continually together; when the theme of conversation was our\r\n      companions or our masters we understood each other, and when I recurred to\r\n      some sentiment of affection, some vague love of an excellent or beautiful\r\n      object, whether in animate or inanimate nature, your sardonic coldness did\r\n      not move me. I felt myself superior to that check then as I do\r\n      now.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is a long time since I wrote to you, and a still longer time since I\r\n      saw you. Chancing to take up a newspaper of your county the other day, my\r\n      eye fell upon your name. I began to think of old times; to run over the\r\n      events which have transpired since we separated; and I sat down and\r\n      commenced this letter. What you have been doing I know not; but you shall\r\n      hear, if you choose to listen, how the world has wagged with me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFirst, after leaving Eton, I had an interview with my maternal uncles,\r\n      Lord Tynedale and the Hon. John Seacombe. They asked me if I would enter\r\n      the Church, and my uncle the nobleman offered me the living of Seacombe,\r\n      which is in his gift, if I would; then my other uncle, Mr. Seacombe,\r\n      hinted that when I became rector of Seacombe-cum-Scaife, I might perhaps\r\n      be allowed to take, as mistress of my house and head of my parish, one of\r\n      my six cousins, his daughters, all of whom I greatly dislike.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI declined both the Church and matrimony. A good clergyman is a good\r\n      thing, but I should have made a very bad one. As to the wife\u2014oh how\r\n      like a night-mare is the thought of being bound for life to one of my\r\n      cousins! No doubt they are accomplished and pretty; but not an\r\n      accomplishment, not a charm of theirs, touches a chord in my bosom. To\r\n      think of passing the winter evenings by the parlour fire-side of Seacombe\r\n      Rectory alone with one of them\u2014for instance, the large and\r\n      well-modelled statue, Sarah\u2014no; I should be a bad husband, under\r\n      such circumstances, as well as a bad clergyman.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhen I had declined my uncles\u2019 offers they asked me \u2018what I intended to\r\n      do?\u2019 I said I should reflect. They reminded me that I had no fortune, and\r\n      no expectation of any, and, after a considerable pause, Lord Tynedale\r\n      demanded sternly, \u2018Whether I had thoughts of following my father\u2019s steps\r\n      and engaging in trade?\u2019 Now, I had had no thoughts of the sort. I do not\r\n      think that my turn of mind qualifies me to make a good tradesman; my\r\n      taste, my ambition does not lie in that way; but such was the scorn\r\n      expressed in Lord Tynedale\u2019s countenance as he pronounced the word\r\n      trade\u2014such\r\n      the contemptuous sarcasm of his tone\u2014that I was instantly decided.\r\n      My father was but a name to me, yet that name I did not like to hear\r\n      mentioned with a sneer to my very face. I answered then, with haste and\r\n      warmth, \u2018I cannot do better than follow in my father\u2019s steps; yes, I will\r\n      be a tradesman.\u2019 My uncles did not remonstrate; they and I parted with\r\n      mutual disgust. In reviewing this transaction, I find that I was quite\r\n      right to shake off the burden of Tynedale\u2019s patronage, but a fool to offer\r\n      my shoulders instantly for the reception of another burden\u2014one which\r\n      might be more intolerable, and which certainly was yet untried.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI wrote instantly to Edward\u2014you know Edward\u2014my only brother,\r\n      ten years my senior, married to a rich mill-owner\u2019s daughter, and now\r\n      possessor of the mill and business which was my father\u2019s before he failed.\r\n      You are aware that my father\u2014once reckoned a Croesus of wealth\u2014became\r\n      bankrupt a short time previous to his death, and that my mother lived in\r\n      destitution for some six months after him, unhelped by her aristocratical\r\n      brothers, whom she had mortally offended by her union with Crimsworth,\r\n      the \u2014\u2014shire manufacturer. At the end of the six months she brought me into\r\n      the world, and then herself left it without, I should think, much regret,\r\n      as it contained little hope or comfort for her.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMy father\u2019s relations took charge of Edward, as they did of me, till I\r\n      was nine years old. At that period it chanced that the representation of\r\n      an important borough in our county fell vacant; Mr. Seacombe stood for it.\r\n      My uncle Crimsworth, an astute mercantile man, took the opportunity of\r\n      writing a fierce letter to the candidate, stating that if he and Lord\r\n      Tynedale did not consent to do something towards the support of their\r\n      sister\u2019s orphan children, he would expose their relentless and malignant\r\n      conduct towards that sister, and do his best to turn the circumstances\r\n      against Mr. Seacombe\u2019s election. That gentleman and Lord T. knew well\r\n      enough that the Crimsworths were an unscrupulous and determined race; they\r\n      knew also that they had influence in the borough of X\u2014\u2014; and,\r\n      making a virtue of necessity, they consented to defray the expenses of my\r\n      education. I was sent to Eton, where I remained ten years, during which\r\n      space of time Edward and I never met. He, when he grew up, entered into\r\n      trade, and pursued his calling with such diligence, ability, and success,\r\n      that now, in his thirtieth year, he was fast making a fortune. Of this I\r\n      was apprised by the occasional short letters I received from him, some\r\n      three or four times a year; which said letters never concluded without\r\n      some expression of determined enmity against the house of Seacombe, and\r\n      some reproach to me for living, as he said, on the bounty of that house.\r\n      At first, while still in boyhood, I could not understand why, as I had no\r\n      parents, I should not be indebted to my uncles Tynedale and Seacombe for\r\n      my education; but as I grew up, and heard by degrees of the persevering\r\n      hostility, the hatred till death evinced by them against my father\u2014of\r\n      the sufferings of my mother\u2014of all the wrongs, in short, of our\r\n      house\u2014then did I conceive shame of the dependence in which I lived,\r\n      and form a resolution no more to take bread from hands which had refused\r\n      to minister to the necessities of my dying mother. It was by these\r\n      feelings I was influenced when I refused the Rectory of Seacombe, and the\r\n      union with one of my patrician cousins.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAn irreparable breach thus being effected between my uncles and myself, I\r\n      wrote to Edward; told him what had occurred, and informed him of my\r\n      intention to follow his steps and be a tradesman. I asked, moreover, if he\r\n      could give me employment. His answer expressed no approbation of my\r\n      conduct, but he said I might come down to \u2014\u2014shire, if I liked,\r\n      and he would \u2018see what could be done in the way of furnishing me with\r\n      work.\u2019 I repressed all\u2014even mental comment on his note\u2014packed\r\n      my trunk and carpet-bag, and started for the North directly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAfter two days\u2019 travelling (railroads were not then in existence) I\r\n      arrived, one wet October afternoon, in the town of X\u2014\u2014. I had\r\n      always understood that Edward lived in this town, but on inquiry I found\r\n      that it was only Mr. Crimsworth\u2019s mill and warehouse which were situated\r\n      in the smoky atmosphere of Bigben Close; his residence lay four\r\n      miles out, in the country.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt was late in the evening when I alighted at the gates of the habitation\r\n      designated to me as my brother\u2019s. As I advanced up the avenue, I could see\r\n      through the shades of twilight, and the dark gloomy mists which deepened\r\n      those shades, that the house was large, and the grounds surrounding it\r\n      sufficiently spacious. I paused a moment on the lawn in front, and leaning\r\n      my back against a tall tree which rose in the centre, I gazed with\r\n      interest on the exterior of Crimsworth Hall.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEdward is rich,\u201d thought I to myself. \u2018I believed him to be doing\r\n      well\u2014but I did not know he was master of a mansion like this.\u2019 Cutting\r\n      short all marvelling, speculation, conjecture, &c., I advanced to the\r\n      front door and rang. A man-servant opened it\u2014I announced myself\u2014he\r\n      relieved me of my wet cloak and carpet-bag, and ushered me into a room\r\n      furnished as a library, where there was a bright fire and candles burning\r\n      on the table; he informed me that his master was not yet returned from\r\n      X\u2014\u2014 market, but that he would certainly be at home in the course of half\r\n      an hour.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBeing left to myself, I took the stuffed easy chair, covered with red\r\n      morocco, which stood by the fireside, and while my eyes watched the flames\r\n      dart from the glowing coals, and the cinders fall at intervals on the\r\n      hearth, my mind busied itself in conjectures concerning the meeting about\r\n      to take place. Amidst much that was doubtful in the subject of these\r\n      conjectures, there was one thing tolerably certain\u2014I was in no\r\n      danger of encountering severe disappointment; from this, the moderation of\r\n      my expectations guaranteed me. I anticipated no overflowings of fraternal\r\n      tenderness; Edward\u2019s letters had always been such as to prevent the\r\n      engendering or harbouring of delusions of this sort. Still, as I sat\r\n      awaiting his arrival, I felt eager\u2014very eager\u2014I cannot tell\r\n      you why; my hand, so utterly a stranger to the grasp of a kindred hand,\r\n      clenched itself to repress the tremor with which impatience would fain\r\n      have shaken it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI thought of my uncles; and as I was engaged in wondering whether\r\n      Edward\u2019s indifference would equal the cold disdain I had always\r\n      experienced from them, I heard the avenue gates open: wheels approached\r\n      the house; Mr. Crimsworth was arrived; and after the lapse of some\r\n      minutes, and a brief dialogue between himself and his servant in the hall,\r\n      his tread drew near the library door\u2014that tread alone announced the\r\n      master of the house.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI still retained some confused recollection of Edward as he was ten years\r\n      ago\u2014a tall, wiry, raw youth; now, as I rose from my seat and\r\n      turned towards the library door, I saw a fine-looking and powerful man,\r\n      light-complexioned, well-made, and of athletic proportions; the first\r\n      glance made me aware of an air of promptitude and sharpness, shown as well\r\n      in his movements as in his port, his eye, and the general expression of\r\n      his face. He greeted me with brevity, and, in the moment of shaking hands,\r\n      scanned me from head to foot; he took his seat in the morocco covered\r\n      arm-chair, and motioned me to another seat.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I expected you would have called at the counting-house in the Close,\u2019\r\n      said he; and his voice, I noticed, had an abrupt accent, probably habitual\r\n      to him; he spoke also with a guttural northern tone, which sounded harsh\r\n      in my ears, accustomed to the silvery utterance of the South.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The landlord of the inn, where the coach stopped, directed me here,\u2019\r\n      said I. \u2018I doubted at first the accuracy of his information, not being\r\n      aware that you had such a residence as this.\u2019\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh, it is all right!\u2019 he replied, \u2018only I was kept half an hour behind\r\n      time, waiting for you\u2014that is all. I thought you must be coming by\r\n      the eight o\u2019clock coach.\u2019\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI expressed regret that he had had to wait; he made no answer, but\r\n      stirred the fire, as if to cover a movement of impatience; then he scanned\r\n      me again.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI felt an inward satisfaction that I had not, in the first moment of\r\n      meeting, betrayed any warmth, any enthusiasm; that I had saluted this man\r\n      with a quiet and steady phlegm.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you quite broken with Tynedale and Seacombe?\u2019 he asked hastily.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I do not think I shall have any further communication with them; my\r\n      refusal of their proposals will, I fancy, operate as a barrier against all\r\n      future intercourse.\u2019\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 said he, \u2018I may as well remind you at the very outset of our\r\n      connection, that \u201cno man can serve two masters.\u201d Acquaintance with Lord\r\n      Tynedale will be incompatible with assistance from me.\u2019 There was a kind\r\n      of gratuitous menace in his eye as he looked at me in finishing this\r\n      observation.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFeeling no disposition to reply to him, I contented myself with an inward\r\n      speculation on the differences which exist in the constitution of men\u2019s\r\n      minds. I do not know what inference Mr. Crimsworth drew from my\r\n      silence\u2014whether he considered it a symptom of contumacity or an evidence\r\n      of my being cowed by his peremptory manner. After a long and hard stare at\r\n      me, he rose sharply from his seat.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018To-morrow,\u2019 said he, \u2018I shall call your attention to some other points;\r\n      but now it is supper time, and Mrs. Crimsworth is probably waiting; will\r\n      you come?\u2019\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHe strode from the room, and I followed. In crossing the hall, I wondered\r\n      what Mrs. Crimsworth might be. \u2018Is she,\u2019 thought I, \u2018as alien to what I\r\n      like as Tynedale, Seacombe, the Misses Seacombe\u2014as the affectionate\r\n      relative now striding before me? or is she better than these? Shall I, in\r\n      conversing with her, feel free to show something of my real nature; or\u2014\u2019\r\n      Further conjectures were arrested by my entrance into the dining-room.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA lamp, burning under a shade of ground-glass, showed a handsome\r\n      apartment, wainscoted with oak; supper was laid on the table; by the\r\n      fire-place, standing as if waiting our entrance, appeared a lady; she was\r\n      young, tall, and well shaped; her dress was handsome and fashionable: so\r\n      much my first glance sufficed to ascertain. A gay salutation passed\r\n      between her and Mr. Crimsworth; she chid him, half playfully, half\r\n      poutingly, for being late; her voice (I always take voices into the\r\n      account in judging of character) was lively\u2014it indicated, I thought,\r\n      good animal spirits. Mr. Crimsworth soon checked her animated scolding\r\n      with a kiss\u2014a kiss that still told of the bridegroom (they had not\r\n      yet been married a year); she took her seat at the supper-table in\r\n      first-rate spirits. Perceiving me, she begged my pardon for not noticing\r\n      me before, and then shook hands with me, as ladies do when a flow of\r\n      good-humour disposes them to be cheerful to all, even the most indifferent\r\n      of their acquaintance. It was now further obvious to me that she had a\r\n      good complexion, and features sufficiently marked but agreeable; her hair\r\n      was red\u2014quite red. She and Edward talked much, always in a vein of\r\n      playful contention; she was vexed, or pretended to be vexed, that he had\r\n      that day driven a vicious horse in the gig, and he made light of her\r\n      fears. Sometimes she appealed to me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Now, Mr. William, isn\u2019t it absurd in Edward to talk so? He says he will\r\n      drive Jack, and no other horse, and the brute has thrown him twice\r\n      already.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cShe spoke with a kind of lisp, not disagreeable, but childish. I soon saw\r\n      also that there was more than girlish\u2014a somewhat infantine\r\n      expression in her by no means small features; this lisp and expression\r\n      were, I have no doubt, a charm in Edward\u2019s eyes, and would be so to those\r\n      of most men, but they were not to mine. I sought her eye, desirous to read\r\n      there the intelligence which I could not discern in her face or hear in\r\n      her conversation; it was merry, rather small; by turns I saw vivacity,\r\n      vanity, coquetry, look out through its irid, but I watched in vain for a\r\n      glimpse of soul. I am no Oriental; white necks, carmine lips and cheeks,\r\n      clusters of bright curls, do not suffice for me without that Promethean\r\n      spark which will live after the roses and lilies are faded, the burnished\r\n      hair grown grey. In sunshine, in prosperity, the flowers are very well;\r\n      but how many wet days are there in life\u2014November seasons of\r\n      disaster, when a man\u2019s hearth and home would be cold indeed, without the\r\n      clear, cheering gleam of intellect.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHaving perused the fair page of Mrs. Crimsworth\u2019s face, a deep,\r\n      involuntary sigh announced my disappointment; she took it as a homage to\r\n      her beauty, and Edward, who was evidently proud of his rich and handsome\r\n      young wife, threw on me a glance\u2014half ridicule, half ire.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI turned from them both, and gazing wearily round the room, I saw two\r\n      pictures set in the oak panelling\u2014one on each side the mantel-piece.\r\n      Ceasing to take part in the bantering conversation that flowed on between\r\n      Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth, I bent my thoughts to the examination of these\r\n      pictures. They were portraits\u2014a lady and a gentleman, both costumed\r\n      in the fashion of twenty years ago. The gentleman was in the shade. I\r\n      could not see him well. The lady had the benefit of a full beam from the\r\n      softly shaded lamp. I presently recognised her; I had seen this picture\r\n      before in childhood; it was my mother; that and the companion picture\r\n      being the only heir-looms saved out of the sale of my father\u2019s property.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThe face, I remembered, had pleased me as a boy, but then I did\r\n      not understand it; now I knew how rare that class of face is in\r\n      the world, and I appreciated keenly its thoughtful, yet gentle expression.\r\n      The serious grey eye possessed for me a strong charm, as did certain lines\r\n      in the features indicative of most true and tender feeling. I was sorry it\r\n      was only a picture.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI soon left Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth to themselves; a servant conducted me\r\n      to my bed-room; in closing my chamber-door, I shut out all intruders\u2014you,\r\n      Charles, as well as the rest.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGood-bye for the present,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWILLIAM CRIMSWORTH.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      To this letter I never got an answer; before my old friend received it, he\r\n      had accepted a Government appointment in one of the colonies, and was\r\n      already on his way to the scene of his official labours. What has become\r\n      of him since, I know not.\r\n    \n\r\n      The leisure time I have at command, and which I intended to employ for his\r\n      private benefit, I shall now dedicate to that of the public at large. My\r\n      narrative is not exciting, and above all, not marvellous; but it may\r\n      interest some individuals, who, having toiled in the same vocation as\r\n      myself, will find in my experience frequent reflections of their own. The\r\n      above letter will serve as an introduction. I now proceed.\r\n    \n"}
{"2": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER II.\r\n    \n\r\n      A FINE October morning succeeded to the foggy evening that had witnessed\r\n      my first introduction to Crimsworth Hall. I was early up and walking in\r\n      the large park-like meadow surrounding the house. The autumn sun, rising\r\n      over the \u2014\u2014shire hills, disclosed a pleasant country; woods\r\n      brown and mellow varied the fields from which the harvest had been lately\r\n      carried; a river, gliding between the woods, caught on its surface the\r\n      somewhat cold gleam of the October sun and sky; at frequent intervals\r\n      along the banks of the river, tall, cylindrical chimneys, almost like\r\n      slender round towers, indicated the factories which the trees half\r\n      concealed; here and there mansions, similar to Crimsworth Hall, occupied\r\n      agreeable sites on the hill-side; the country wore, on the whole, a\r\n      cheerful, active, fertile look. Steam, trade, machinery had long banished\r\n      from it all romance and seclusion. At a distance of five miles, a valley,\r\n      opening between the low hills, held in its cups the great town of X\u2014\u2014.\r\n      A dense, permanent vapour brooded over this locality\u2014there lay\r\n      Edward\u2019s \u201cConcern.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I forced my eye to scrutinize this prospect, I forced my mind to dwell on\r\n      it for a time, and when I found that it communicated no pleasurable\r\n      emotion to my heart\u2014that it stirred in me none of the hopes a man\r\n      ought to feel, when he sees laid before him the scene of his life\u2019s\r\n      career\u2014I said to myself, \u201cWilliam, you are a rebel against circumstances;\r\n      you are a fool, and know not what you want; you have chosen trade and you\r\n      shall be a tradesman. Look!\u201d I continued mentally\u2014\u201cLook at the sooty smoke\r\n      in that hollow, and know that there is your post! There you cannot dream,\r\n      you cannot speculate and theorize\u2014there you shall out and work!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Thus self-schooled, I returned to the house. My brother was in the\r\n      breakfast-room. I met him collectedly\u2014I could not meet him\r\n      cheerfully; he was standing on the rug, his back to the fire\u2014how\r\n      much did I read in the expression of his eye as my glance encountered his,\r\n      when I advanced to bid him good morning; how much that was contradictory\r\n      to my nature! He said \u201cGood morning\u201d abruptly and nodded, and then he\r\n      snatched, rather than took, a newspaper from the table, and began to read\r\n      it with the air of a master who seizes a pretext to escape the bore of\r\n      conversing with an underling. It was well I had taken a resolution to\r\n      endure for a time, or his manner would have gone far to render\r\n      insupportable the disgust I had just been endeavouring to subdue. I looked\r\n      at him: I measured his robust frame and powerful proportions; I saw my own\r\n      reflection in the mirror over the mantel-piece; I amused myself with\r\n      comparing the two pictures. In face I resembled him, though I was not so\r\n      handsome; my features were less regular; I had a darker eye, and a broader\r\n      brow\u2014in form I was greatly inferior\u2014thinner, slighter, not so\r\n      tall. As an animal, Edward excelled me far; should he prove as paramount\r\n      in mind as in person I must be a slave\u2014for I must expect from him no\r\n      lion-like generosity to one weaker than himself; his cold, avaricious eye,\r\n      his stern, forbidding manner told me he would not spare. Had I then force\r\n      of mind to cope with him? I did not know; I had never been tried.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mrs. Crimsworth\u2019s entrance diverted my thoughts for a moment. She looked\r\n      well, dressed in white, her face and her attire shining in morning and\r\n      bridal freshness. I addressed her with the degree of ease her last night\u2019s\r\n      careless gaiety seemed to warrant, but she replied with coolness and\r\n      restraint: her husband had tutored her; she was not to be too familiar\r\n      with his clerk.\r\n    \n\r\n      As soon as breakfast was over Mr. Crimsworth intimated to me that they\r\n      were bringing the gig round to the door, and that in five minutes he\r\n      should expect me to be ready to go down with him to X\u2014\u2014. I did\r\n      not keep him waiting; we were soon dashing at a rapid rate along the road.\r\n      The horse he drove was the same vicious animal about which Mrs. Crimsworth\r\n      had expressed her fears the night before. Once or twice Jack seemed\r\n      disposed to turn restive, but a vigorous and determined application of the\r\n      whip from the ruthless hand of his master soon compelled him to\r\n      submission, and Edward\u2019s dilated nostril expressed his triumph in the\r\n      result of the contest; he scarcely spoke to me during the whole of the\r\n      brief drive, only opening his lips at intervals to damn his horse.\r\n    \n\r\n      X\u2014\u2014 was all stir and bustle when we entered it; we left the\r\n      clean streets where there were dwelling-houses and shops, churches, and\r\n      public buildings; we left all these, and turned down to a region of mills\r\n      and warehouses; thence we passed through two massive gates into a great\r\n      paved yard, and we were in Bigben Close, and the mill was before us,\r\n      vomiting soot from its long chimney, and quivering through its thick brick\r\n      walls with the commotion of its iron bowels. Workpeople were passing to\r\n      and fro; a waggon was being laden with pieces. Mr. Crimsworth looked from\r\n      side to side, and seemed at one glance to comprehend all that was going\r\n      on; he alighted, and leaving his horse and gig to the care of a man who\r\n      hastened to take the reins from his hand, he bid me follow him to the\r\n      counting-house. We entered it; a very different place from the parlours of\r\n      Crimsworth Hall\u2014a place for business, with a bare, planked floor, a\r\n      safe, two high desks and stools, and some chairs. A person was seated at\r\n      one of the desks, who took off his square cap when Mr. Crimsworth entered,\r\n      and in an instant was again absorbed in his occupation of writing or\r\n      calculating\u2014I know not which.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mr. Crimsworth, having removed his mackintosh, sat down by the fire. I\r\n      remained standing near the hearth; he said presently\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSteighton, you may leave the room; I have some business to transact with\r\n      this gentleman. Come back when you hear the bell.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The individual at the desk rose and departed, closing the door as he went\r\n      out. Mr. Crimsworth stirred the fire, then folded his arms, and sat a\r\n      moment thinking, his lips compressed, his brow knit. I had nothing to do\r\n      but to watch him\u2014how well his features were cut! what a handsome man\r\n      he was! Whence, then, came that air of contraction\u2014that narrow and\r\n      hard aspect on his forehead, in all his lineaments?\r\n    \n\r\n      Turning to me he began abruptly:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou are come down to \u2014\u2014shire to learn to be a tradesman?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHave you made up your mind on the point? Let me know that at once.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, I am not bound to help you, but I have a place here vacant, if you\r\n      are qualified for it. I will take you on trial. What can you do? Do you\r\n      know anything besides that useless trash of college learning\u2014Greek,\r\n      Latin, and so forth?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI have studied mathematics.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStuff! I dare say you have.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI can read and write French and German.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHum!\u201d He reflected a moment, then opening a drawer in a desk near him\r\n      took out a letter, and gave it to me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCan you read that?\u201d he asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was a German commercial letter; I translated it; I could not tell\r\n      whether he was gratified or not\u2014his countenance remained fixed.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is well,\u201d he said, after a pause, \u201cthat you are acquainted with\r\n      something useful, something that may enable you to earn your board and\r\n      lodging: since you know French and German, I will take you as second clerk\r\n      to manage the foreign correspondence of the house. I shall give you a good\r\n      salary\u2014\u00a390 a year\u2014and now,\u201d he continued, raising his voice,\r\n      \u201chear once for all what I have to say about our relationship, and all that\r\n      sort of humbug! I must have no nonsense on that point; it would never suit\r\n      me. I shall excuse you nothing on the plea of being my brother; if I find\r\n      you stupid, negligent, dissipated, idle, or possessed of any faults\r\n      detrimental to the interests of the house, I shall dismiss you as I would\r\n      any other clerk. Ninety pounds a year are good wages, and I expect to have\r\n      the full value of my money out of you; remember, too, that things are on a\r\n      practical footing in my establishment\u2014business-like habits,\r\n      feelings, and ideas, suit me best. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPartly,\u201d I replied. \u201cI suppose you mean that I am to do my work for my\r\n      wages; not to expect favour from you, and not to depend on you for any\r\n      help but what I earn; that suits me exactly, and on these terms I will\r\n      consent to be your clerk.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I turned on my heel, and walked to the window; this time I did not consult\r\n      his face to learn his opinion: what it was I do not know, nor did I then\r\n      care. After a silence of some minutes he recommenced:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou perhaps expect to be accommodated with apartments at Crimsworth Hall,\r\n      and to go and come with me in the gig. I wish you, however, to be aware\r\n      that such an arrangement would be quite inconvenient to me. I like to have\r\n      the seat in my gig at liberty for any gentleman whom for business reasons\r\n      I may wish to take down to the hall for a night or so. You will seek out\r\n      lodgings in X\u2014\u2014.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Quitting the window, I walked back to the hearth.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOf course I shall seek out lodgings in X\u2014\u2014,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\r\n      would not suit me either to lodge at Crimsworth Hall.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      My tone was quiet. I always speak quietly. Yet Mr. Crimsworth\u2019s blue eye\r\n      became incensed; he took his revenge rather oddly. Turning to me he said\r\n      bluntly\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou are poor enough, I suppose; how do you expect to live till your\r\n      quarter\u2019s salary becomes due?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI shall get on,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow do you expect to live?\u201d he repeated in a louder voice.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAs I can, Mr. Crimsworth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGet into debt at your peril! that\u2019s all,\u201d he answered. \u201cFor aught I know\r\n      you may have extravagant aristocratic habits: if you have, drop them; I\r\n      tolerate nothing of the sort here, and I will never give you a shilling\r\n      extra, whatever liabilities you may incur\u2014mind that.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, Mr. Crimsworth, you will find I have a good memory.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I said no more. I did not think the time was come for much parley. I had\r\n      an instinctive feeling that it would be folly to let one\u2019s temper\r\n      effervesce often with such a man as Edward. I said to myself, \u201cI will\r\n      place my cup under this continual dropping; it shall stand there still and\r\n      steady; when full, it will run over of itself\u2014meantime patience. Two\r\n      things are certain. I am capable of performing the work Mr. Crimsworth has\r\n      set me; I can earn my wages conscientiously, and those wages are\r\n      sufficient to enable me to live. As to the fact of my brother assuming\r\n      towards me the bearing of a proud, harsh master, the fault is his, not\r\n      mine; and shall his injustice, his bad feeling, turn me at once aside from\r\n      the path I have chosen? No; at least, ere I deviate, I will advance far\r\n      enough to see whither my career tends. As yet I am only pressing in at the\r\n      entrance\u2014a strait gate enough; it ought to have a good terminus.\u201d\r\n       While I thus reasoned, Mr. Crimsworth rang a bell; his first clerk, the\r\n      individual dismissed previously to our conference, re-entered.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMr. Steighton,\u201d said he, \u201cshow Mr. William the letters from Voss,\r\n      Brothers, and give him English copies of the answers; he will translate\r\n      them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mr. Steighton, a man of about thirty-five, with a face at once sly and\r\n      heavy, hastened to execute this order; he laid the letters on the desk,\r\n      and I was soon seated at it, and engaged in rendering the English answers\r\n      into German. A sentiment of keen pleasure accompanied this first effort to\r\n      earn my own living\u2014a sentiment neither poisoned nor weakened by the\r\n      presence of the taskmaster, who stood and watched me for some time as I\r\n      wrote. I thought he was trying to read my character, but I felt as secure\r\n      against his scrutiny as if I had had on a casque with the visor down\u2014or\r\n      rather I showed him my countenance with the confidence that one would show\r\n      an unlearned man a letter written in Greek; he might see lines, and trace\r\n      characters, but he could make nothing of them; my nature was not his\r\n      nature, and its signs were to him like the words of an unknown tongue. Ere\r\n      long he turned away abruptly, as if baffled, and left the counting-house;\r\n      he returned to it but twice in the course of that day; each time he mixed\r\n      and swallowed a glass of brandy-and-water, the materials for making which\r\n      he extracted from a cupboard on one side of the fireplace; having glanced\r\n      at my translations\u2014he could read both French and German\u2014he\r\n      went out again in silence.\r\n    \n"}
{"3": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER III.\r\n    \n\r\n      I SERVED Edward as his second clerk faithfully, punctually, diligently.\r\n      What was given me to do I had the power and the determination to do well.\r\n      Mr. Crimsworth watched sharply for defects, but found none; he set Timothy\r\n      Steighton, his favourite and head man, to watch also. Tim was baffled; I\r\n      was as exact as himself, and quicker. Mr. Crimsworth made inquiries as to\r\n      how I lived, whether I got into debt\u2014no, my accounts with my\r\n      landlady were always straight. I had hired small lodgings, which I\r\n      contrived to pay for out of a slender fund\u2014the accumulated savings\r\n      of my Eton pocket-money; for as it had ever been abhorrent to my nature to\r\n      ask pecuniary assistance, I had early acquired habits of self-denying\r\n      economy; husbanding my monthly allowance with anxious care, in order to\r\n      obviate the danger of being forced, in some moment of future exigency, to\r\n      beg additional aid. I remember many called me miser at the time, and I\r\n      used to couple the reproach with this consolation\u2014better to be\r\n      misunderstood now than repulsed hereafter. At this day I had my reward; I\r\n      had had it before, when on parting with my irritated uncles one of them\r\n      threw down on the table before me a \u00a35 note, which I was able to leave\r\n      there, saying that my travelling expenses were already provided for. Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth employed Tim to find out whether my landlady had any complaint\r\n      to make on the score of my morals; she answered that she believed I was a\r\n      very religious man, and asked Tim, in her turn, if he thought I had any\r\n      intention of going into the Church some day; for, she said, she had had\r\n      young curates to lodge in her house who were nothing equal to me for\r\n      steadiness and quietness. Tim was \u201ca religious man\u201d himself; indeed, he\r\n      was \u201ca joined Methodist,\u201d which did not (be it understood) prevent him\r\n      from being at the same time an engrained rascal, and he came away much\r\n      posed at hearing this account of my piety. Having imparted it to Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth, that gentleman, who himself frequented no place of worship,\r\n      and owned no God but Mammon, turned the information into a weapon of\r\n      attack against the equability of my temper. He commenced a series of\r\n      covert sneers, of which I did not at first perceive the drift, till my\r\n      landlady happened to relate the conversation she had had with Mr.\r\n      Steighton; this enlightened me; afterwards I came to the counting-house\r\n      prepared, and managed to receive the millowner\u2019s blasphemous sarcasms,\r\n      when next levelled at me, on a buckler of impenetrable indifference. Ere\r\n      long he tired of wasting his ammunition on a statue, but he did not throw\r\n      away the shafts\u2014he only kept them quiet in his quiver.\r\n    \n\r\n      Once during my clerkship I had an invitation to Crimsworth Hall; it was on\r\n      the occasion of a large party given in honour of the master\u2019s birthday; he\r\n      had always been accustomed to invite his clerks on similar anniversaries,\r\n      and could not well pass me over; I was, however, kept strictly in the\r\n      background. Mrs. Crimsworth, elegantly dressed in satin and lace, blooming\r\n      in youth and health, vouchsafed me no more notice than was expressed by a\r\n      distant move; Crimsworth, of course, never spoke to me; I was introduced\r\n      to none of the band of young ladies, who, enveloped in silvery clouds of\r\n      white gauze and muslin, sat in array against me on the opposite side of a\r\n      long and large room; in fact, I was fairly isolated, and could but\r\n      contemplate the shining ones from afar, and when weary of such a dazzling\r\n      scene, turn for a change to the consideration of the carpet pattern. Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth, standing on the rug, his elbow supported by the marble\r\n      mantelpiece, and about him a group of very pretty girls, with whom he\r\n      conversed gaily\u2014Mr. Crimsworth, thus placed, glanced at me; I looked\r\n      weary, solitary, kept down like some desolate tutor or governess; he was\r\n      satisfied.\r\n    \n\r\n      Dancing began; I should have liked well enough to be introduced to some\r\n      pleasing and intelligent girl, and to have freedom and opportunity to show\r\n      that I could both feel and communicate the pleasure of social\r\n      intercourse\u2014that I was not, in short, a block, or a piece of furniture,\r\n      but an acting, thinking, sentient man. Many smiling faces and graceful\r\n      figures glided past me, but the smiles were lavished on other eyes, the\r\n      figures sustained by other hands than mine. I turned away tantalized, left\r\n      the dancers, and wandered into the oak-panelled dining-room. No fibre of\r\n      sympathy united me to any living thing in this house; I looked for and\r\n      found my mother\u2019s picture. I took a wax taper from a stand, and held it\r\n      up. I gazed long, earnestly; my heart grew to the image. My mother, I\r\n      perceived, had bequeathed to me much of her features and countenance\u2014her\r\n      forehead, her eyes, her complexion. No regular beauty pleases egotistical\r\n      human beings so much as a softened and refined likeness of themselves; for\r\n      this reason, fathers regard with complacency the lineaments of their\r\n      daughters\u2019 faces, where frequently their own similitude is found\r\n      flatteringly associated with softness of hue and delicacy of outline. I\r\n      was just wondering how that picture, to me so interesting, would strike an\r\n      impartial spectator, when a voice close behind me pronounced the words\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHumph! there\u2019s some sense in that face.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I turned; at my elbow stood a tall man, young, though probably five or six\r\n      years older than I\u2014in other respects of an appearance the opposite\r\n      to common place; though just now, as I am not disposed to paint his\r\n      portrait in detail, the reader must be content with the silhouette I have\r\n      just thrown off; it was all I myself saw of him for the moment: I did not\r\n      investigate the colour of his eyebrows, nor of his eyes either; I saw his\r\n      stature, and the outline of his shape; I saw, too, his fastidious-looking\r\n      retrouss\u00e9 nose; these observations, few in number, and\r\n      general in character (the last excepted), sufficed, for they enabled me to\r\n      recognize       him.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGood evening, Mr. Hunsden,\u201d muttered I with a bow, and then, like a shy\r\n      noodle as I was, I began moving away\u2014and why? Simply because Mr.\r\n      Hunsden was a manufacturer and a millowner, and I was only a clerk, and my\r\n      instinct propelled me from my superior. I had frequently seen Hunsden in\r\n      Bigben Close, where he came almost weekly to transact business with Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth, but I had never spoken to him, nor he to me, and I owed him a\r\n      sort of involuntary grudge, because he had more than once been the tacit\r\n      witness of insults offered by Edward to me. I had the conviction that he\r\n      could only regard me as a poor-spirited slave, wherefore I now went about\r\n      to shun his presence and eschew his conversation.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked he, as I edged off sideways. I had already\r\n      noticed that Mr. Hunsden indulged in abrupt forms of speech, and I\r\n      perversely said to myself\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHe thinks he may speak as he likes to a poor clerk; but my mood is not,\r\n      perhaps, so supple as he deems it, and his rough freedom pleases me not at\r\n      all.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I made some slight reply, rather indifferent than courteous, and continued\r\n      to move away. He coolly planted himself in my path.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cStay here awhile,\u201d said he: \u201cit is so hot in the dancing-room; besides,\r\n      you don\u2019t dance; you have not had a partner to-night.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He was right, and as he spoke neither his look, tone, nor manner\r\n      displeased me; my amour-propre was propitiated; he had\r\n      not addressed me out of condescension, but because, having repaired to the\r\n      cool dining-room for refreshment, he now wanted some one to talk to, by\r\n      way of temporary amusement. I hate to be condescended to, but I like well\r\n      enough to oblige; I stayed.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThat is a good picture,\u201d he continued, recurring to the portrait.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDo you consider the face pretty?\u201d I asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPretty! no\u2014how can it be pretty, with sunk eyes and hollow cheeks?\r\n      but it is peculiar; it seems to think. You could have a talk with that\r\n      woman, if she were alive, on other subjects than dress, visiting, and\r\n      compliments.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I agreed with him, but did not say so. He went on.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNot that I admire a head of that sort; it wants character and force;\r\n      there\u2019s too much of the sen-si-tive (so he articulated it, curling his lip\r\n      at the same time) in that mouth; besides, there is Aristocrat written on\r\n      the brow and defined in the figure; I hate your aristocrats.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou think, then, Mr. Hunsden, that patrician descent may be read in a\r\n      distinctive cast of form and features?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPatrician descent be hanged! Who doubts that your lordlings may have\r\n      their \u2018distinctive cast of form and features\u2019 as much as we \u2014\u2014shire\r\n      tradesmen have ours? But which is the best? Not theirs assuredly. As to\r\n      their women, it is a little different: they cultivate beauty from\r\n      childhood upwards, and may by care and training attain to a certain degree\r\n      of excellence in that point, just like the oriental odalisques. Yet even\r\n      this superiority is doubtful. Compare the figure in that frame with Mrs.\r\n      Edward Crimsworth\u2014which is the finer animal?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I replied quietly: \u201cCompare yourself and Mr. Edward Crimsworth, Mr\r\n      Hunsden.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, Crimsworth is better filled up than I am, I know besides he has a\r\n      straight nose, arched eyebrows, and all that; but these advantages\u2014if\r\n      they are advantages\u2014he did not inherit from his mother, the\r\n      patrician, but from his father, old Crimsworth, who, my father\r\n      says, was as veritable a \u2014\u2014shire blue-dyer as ever put indigo in a vat\r\n      yet withal the handsomest man in the three Ridings. It is you, William,\r\n      who are the aristocrat of your family, and you are not as fine a fellow as\r\n      your plebeian brother by long chalk.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      There was something in Mr. Hunsden\u2019s point-blank mode of speech which\r\n      rather pleased me than otherwise because it set me at my ease. I continued\r\n      the conversation with a degree of interest.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow do you happen to know that I am Mr. Crimsworth\u2019s brother? I thought\r\n      you and everybody else looked upon me only in the light of a poor clerk.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, and so we do; and what are you but a poor clerk? You do\r\n      Crimsworth\u2019s work, and he gives you wages\u2014shabby wages they are,\r\n      too.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I was silent. Hunsden\u2019s language now bordered on the impertinent, still\r\n      his manner did not offend me in the least\u2014it only piqued my\r\n      curiosity; I wanted him to go on, which he did in a little while.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThis world is an absurd one,\u201d said he.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhy so, Mr. Hunsden?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI wonder you should ask: you are yourself a strong proof of the absurdity\r\n      I allude to.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I was determined he should explain himself of his own accord, without my\r\n      pressing him so to do\u2014so I resumed my silence.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIs it your intention to become a tradesman?\u201d he inquired presently.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt was my serious intention three months ago.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHumph! the more fool you\u2014you look like a tradesman! What a\r\n      practical business-like face you have!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMy face is as the Lord made it, Mr. Hunsden.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThe Lord never made either your face or head for X\u2014\u2014 What\r\n      good can your bumps of ideality, comparison, self-esteem,\r\n      conscientiousness, do you here? But if you like Bigben Close, stay there;\r\n      it\u2019s your own affair, not mine.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps I have no choice.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, I care nought about it\u2014it will make little difference to me\r\n      what you do or where you go; but I\u2019m cool now\u2014I want to dance again;\r\n      and I see such a fine girl sitting in the corner of the sofa there by her\r\n      mamma; see if I don\u2019t get her for a partner in a jiffy! There\u2019s Waddy\u2014Sam\r\n      Waddy making up to her; won\u2019t I cut him out?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And Mr. Hunsden strode away. I watched him through the open folding-doors;\r\n      he outstripped Waddy, applied for the hand of the fine girl, and led her\r\n      off triumphant. She was a tall, well-made, full-formed, dashingly-dressed\r\n      young woman, much in the style of Mrs. E. Crimsworth; Hunsden whirled her\r\n      through the waltz with spirit; he kept at her side during the remainder of\r\n      the evening, and I read in her animated and gratified countenance that he\r\n      succeeded in making himself perfectly agreeable. The mamma too (a stout\r\n      person in a turban\u2014Mrs. Lupton by name) looked well pleased;\r\n      prophetic visions probably flattered her inward eye. The Hunsdens were of\r\n      an old stem; and scornful as Yorke (such was my late interlocutor\u2019s name)\r\n      professed to be of the advantages of birth, in his secret heart he well\r\n      knew and fully appreciated the distinction his ancient, if not high\r\n      lineage conferred on him in a mushroom-place like X\u2014\u2014,\r\n      concerning whose inhabitants it was proverbially said, that not one in a\r\n      thousand knew his own grandfather. Moreover the Hunsdens, once rich, were\r\n      still independent; and report affirmed that Yorke bade fair, by his\r\n      success in business, to restore to pristine prosperity the partially\r\n      decayed fortunes of his house. These circumstances considered, Mrs.\r\n      Lupton\u2019s broad face might well wear a smile of complacency as she\r\n      contemplated the heir of Hunsden Wood occupied in paying assiduous court\r\n      to her darling Sarah Martha. I, however, whose observations being less\r\n      anxious, were likely to be more accurate, soon saw that the grounds for\r\n      maternal self-congratulation were slight indeed; the gentleman appeared to\r\n      me much more desirous of making, than susceptible of receiving an\r\n      impression. I know not what it was in Mr. Hunsden that, as I watched him\r\n      (I had nothing better to do), suggested to me, every now and then, the\r\n      idea of a foreigner. In form and features he might be pronounced English,\r\n      though even there one caught a dash of something Gallic; but he had no\r\n      English shyness: he had learnt somewhere, somehow, the art of setting\r\n      himself quite at his ease, and of allowing no insular timidity to\r\n      intervene as a barrier between him and his convenience or pleasure.\r\n      Refinement he did not affect, yet vulgar he could not be called; he was\r\n      not odd\u2014no quiz\u2014yet he resembled no one else I had ever seen\r\n      before; his general bearing intimated complete, sovereign satisfaction\r\n      with himself; yet, at times, an indescribable shade passed like an eclipse\r\n      over his countenance, and seemed to me like the sign of a sudden and\r\n      strong inward doubt of himself, his words and actions an energetic\r\n      discontent at his life or his social position, his future prospects or his\r\n      mental attainments\u2014I know not which; perhaps after all it might only\r\n      be a bilious caprice.\r\n    \n"}

The thing\r\n      itself\u2014the work of copying and translating business-letters\u2014was\r\n      a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been all, I should long have\r\n      borne with the nuisance; I am not of an impatient nature, and influenced\r\n      by the double desire of getting my living and justifying to myself and\r\n      others the resolution I had taken to become a tradesman, I should have\r\n      endured in silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I should not\r\n      have whispered, even inwardly, that I longed for liberty; I should have\r\n      pent in every sigh by which my heart might have ventured to intimate its\r\n      distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony and joyless tumult of Bigben\r\n      Close, and its panting desire for freer and fresher scenes; I should have\r\n      set up the image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my small bedroom\r\n      at Mrs. King\u2019s lodgings, and they two should have been my household gods,\r\n      from which my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the tender and\r\n      the mighty, should never, either by softness or strength, have severed me.\r\n      But this was not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between myself and\r\n      my employer striking deeper root and spreading denser shade daily,\r\n      excluded me from every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to\r\n      feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the slimy walls of a\r\n      well.\r\n    \n\r\n      Antipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward Crimsworth\r\n      had for me\u2014a feeling, in a great measure, involuntary, and which was\r\n      liable to be excited by every, the most trifling movement, look, or word\r\n      of mine. My southern accent annoyed him; the degree of education evinced\r\n      in my language irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and accuracy,\r\n      fixed his dislike, and gave it the high flavour and poignant relish of\r\n      envy; he feared that I too should one day make a successful tradesman. Had\r\n      I been in anything inferior to him, he would not have hated me so\r\n      thoroughly, but I knew all that he knew, and, what was worse, he suspected\r\n      that I kept the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he was no\r\n      sharer. If he could have once placed me in a ridiculous or mortifying\r\n      position, he would have forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three\r\n      faculties\u2014Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling and prying as was\r\n      Edward\u2019s malignity, it could never baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my\r\n      natural sentinels. Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it\r\n      would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its slumber; but tact, if\r\n      it be genuine, never sleeps.\r\n    \n\r\n      I had received my first quarter\u2019s wages, and was returning to my lodgings,\r\n      possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who had\r\n      paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned pittance\u2014(I had long\r\n      ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother\u2014he was a hard,\r\n      grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable tyrant: that was all).\r\n      Thoughts, not varied but strong, occupied my mind; two voices spoke within\r\n      me; again and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases. One said:\r\n      \u201cWilliam, your life is intolerable.\u201d The other: \u201cWhat can you do to alter\r\n      it?\u201d I walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I\r\n      approached my lodgings, I turned from a general view of my affairs to the\r\n      particular speculation as to whether my fire would be out; looking towards\r\n      the window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red gleam.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThat slut of a servant has neglected it as usual,\u201d said I, \u201cand I shall\r\n      see nothing but pale ashes if I go in; it is a fine starlight night\u2014I\r\n      will walk a little farther.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      It was a fine night, and the streets were dry and even clean for\r\n      X\u2014\u2014; there was a crescent curve of moonlight to be seen by the parish\r\n      church tower, and hundreds of stars shone keenly bright in all quarters of\r\n      the sky.\r\n    \n\r\n      Unconsciously I steered my course towards the country; I had got into\r\n      Grove Street, and began to feel the pleasure of seeing dim trees at the\r\n      extremity, round a suburban house, when a person leaning over the iron\r\n      gate of one of the small gardens which front the neat dwelling-houses in\r\n      this street, addressed me as I was hurrying with quick stride past.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat the deuce is the hurry? Just so must Lot have left Sodom, when he\r\n      expected fire to pour down upon it, out of burning brass clouds.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I stopped short, and looked towards the speaker. I smelt the fragrance,\r\n      and saw the red spark of a cigar; the dusk outline of a man, too, bent\r\n      towards me over the wicket.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou see I am meditating in the field at eventide,\u201d continued this shade.\r\n      \u201cGod knows it\u2019s cool work! especially as instead of Rebecca on a camel\u2019s\r\n      hump, with bracelets on her arms and a ring in her nose, Fate sends me\r\n      only a counting-house clerk, in a grey tweed wrapper.\u201d The voice was\r\n      familiar to me\u2014its second utterance enabled me to seize the\r\n      speaker\u2019s identity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMr. Hunsden! good evening.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGood evening, indeed! yes, but you would have passed me without\r\n      recognition if I had not been so civil as to speak first.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI did not know you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA famous excuse! You ought to have known me; I knew you, though you were\r\n      going ahead like a steam-engine. Are the police after you?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth their while; I\u2019m not of consequence enough to\r\n      attract them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAlas, poor shepherd! Alack and well-a-day! What a theme for regret, and\r\n      how down in the mouth you must be, judging from the sound of your voice!\r\n      But since you\u2019re not running from the police, from whom are you running?\r\n      the devil?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, I am going post to him.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat is well\u2014you\u2019re just in luck: this is Tuesday evening; there\r\n      are scores of market gigs and carts returning to Dinneford to-night; and\r\n      he, or some of his, have a seat in all regularly; so, if you\u2019ll step in\r\n      and sit half-an-hour in my bachelor\u2019s parlour, you may catch him as he\r\n      passes without much trouble. I think though you\u2019d better let him alone\r\n      to-night, he\u2019ll have so many customers to serve; Tuesday is his busy day\r\n      in X\u2014\u2014 and Dinneford; come in at all events.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He swung the wicket open as he spoke.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDo you really wish me to go in?\u201d I asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAs you please\u2014I\u2019m alone; your company for an hour or two would be\r\n      agreeable to me; but, if you don\u2019t choose to favour me so far, I\u2019ll not\r\n      press the point. I hate to bore any one.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      It suited me to accept the invitation as it suited Hunsden to give it. I\r\n      passed through the gate, and followed him to the front door, which he\r\n      opened; thence we traversed a passage, and entered his parlour; the door\r\n      being shut, he pointed me to an arm-chair by the hearth; I sat down, and\r\n      glanced round me.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was a comfortable room, at once snug and handsome; the bright grate was\r\n      filled with a genuine \u2014\u2014shire fire, red, clear, and generous,\r\n      no penurious South-of-England embers heaped in the corner of a grate. On\r\n      the table a shaded lamp diffused around a soft, pleasant, and equal light;\r\n      the furniture was almost luxurious for a young bachelor, comprising a\r\n      couch and two very easy chairs; bookshelves filled the recesses on each\r\n      side of the mantelpiece; they were well-furnished, and arranged with\r\n      perfect order. The neatness of the room suited my taste; I hate irregular\r\n      and slovenly habits. From what I saw I concluded that Hunsden\u2019s ideas on\r\n      that point corresponded with my own. While he removed from the\r\n      centre-table to the side-board a few pamphlets and periodicals, I ran my\r\n      eye along the shelves of the book-case nearest me. French and German works\r\n      predominated, the old French dramatists, sundry modern authors, Thiers,\r\n      Villemain, Paul de Kock, George Sand, Eugene Sue; in German\u2014Go\u00ebthe,\r\n      Schiller, Zschokke, Jean Paul Richter; in English there were works on\r\n      Political Economy. I examined no further, for Mr. Hunsden himself recalled\r\n      my attention.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou shall have something,\u201d said he, \u201cfor you ought to feel disposed for\r\n      refreshment after walking nobody knows how far on such a Canadian night as\r\n      this; but it shall not be brandy-and-water, and it shall not be a bottle\r\n      of port, nor ditto of sherry. I keep no such poison. I have Rhein-wein for\r\n      my own drinking, and you may choose between that and coffee.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Here again Hunsden suited me: if there was one generally received practice\r\n      I abhorred more than another, it was the habitual imbibing of spirits and\r\n      strong wines. I had, however, no fancy for his acid German nectar, but I\r\n      liked coffee, so I responded\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGive me some coffee, Mr. Hunsden.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I perceived my answer pleased him; he had doubtless expected to see a\r\n      chilling effect produced by his steady announcement that he would give me\r\n      neither wine nor spirits; he just shot one searching glance at my face to\r\n      ascertain whether my cordiality was genuine or a mere feint of politeness.\r\n      I smiled, because I quite understood him; and, while I honoured his\r\n      conscientious firmness, I was amused at his mistrust; he seemed satisfied,\r\n      rang the bell, and ordered coffee, which was presently brought; for\r\n      himself, a bunch of grapes and half a pint of something sour sufficed. My\r\n      coffee was excellent; I told him so, and expressed the shuddering pity\r\n      with which his anchorite fare inspired me. He did not answer, and I\r\n      scarcely think heard my remark. At that moment one of those momentary\r\n      eclipses I before alluded to had come over his face, extinguishing his\r\n      smile, and replacing, by an abstracted and alienated look, the customarily\r\n      shrewd, bantering glance of his eye. I employed the interval of silence in\r\n      a rapid scrutiny of his physiognomy. I had never observed him closely\r\n      before; and, as my sight is very short, I had gathered only a vague,\r\n      general idea of his appearance; I was surprised now, on examination, to\r\n      perceive how small, and even feminine, were his lineaments; his tall\r\n      figure, long and dark locks, his voice and general bearing, had impressed\r\n      me with the notion of something powerful and massive; not at all:\u2014my\r\n      own features were cast in a harsher and squarer mould than his. I\r\n      discerned that there would be contrasts between his inward and outward\r\n      man; contentions, too; for I suspected his soul had more of will and\r\n      ambition than his body had of fibre and muscle. Perhaps, in these\r\n      incompatibilities of the \u201cphysique\u201d with the \u201cmorale,\u201d lay the secret of\r\n      that fitful gloom; he would but could not, and the\r\n      athletic mind scowled\r\n      scorn on its more fragile companion. As to his good looks, I should have\r\n      liked to have a woman\u2019s opinion on that subject; it seemed to me that his\r\n      face might produce the same effect on a lady that a very piquant and\r\n      interesting, though scarcely pretty, female face would on a man. I have\r\n      mentioned his dark locks\u2014they were brushed sideways above a white\r\n      and sufficiently expansive forehead; his cheek had a rather hectic\r\n      freshness; his features might have done well on canvas, but indifferently\r\n      in marble: they were plastic; character had set a stamp upon each;\r\n      expression re-cast them at her pleasure, and strange metamorphoses she\r\n      wrought, giving him now the mien of a morose bull, and anon that of an\r\n      arch and mischievous girl; more frequently, the two semblances were blent,\r\n      and a queer, composite countenance they made.\r\n    \n\r\n      Starting from his silent fit, he began:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWilliam! what a fool you are to live in those dismal lodgings of Mrs.\r\n      King\u2019s, when you might take rooms here in Grove Street, and have a garden\r\n      like me!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should be too far from the mill.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat of that? It would do you good to walk there and back two or three\r\n      times a day; besides, are you such a fossil that you never wish to see a\r\n      flower or a green leaf?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI am no fossil.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you then? You sit at that desk in Crimsworth\u2019s counting-house\r\n      day by day and week by week, scraping with a pen on paper, just like an\r\n      automaton; you never get up; you never say you are tired; you never ask\r\n      for a holiday; you never take change or relaxation; you give way to no\r\n      excess of an evening; you neither keep wild company, nor indulge in strong\r\n      drink.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDo you, Mr. Hunsden?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t think to pose me with short questions; your case and mine are\r\n      diametrically different, and it is nonsense attempting to draw a parallel.\r\n      I say, that when a man endures patiently what ought to be unendurable, he\r\n      is a fossil.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhence do you acquire the knowledge of my patience?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy, man, do you suppose you are a mystery? The other night you seemed\r\n      surprised at my knowing to what family you belonged; now you find subject\r\n      for wonderment in my calling you patient. What do you think I do with my\r\n      eyes and ears? I\u2019ve been in your counting-house more than once when\r\n      Crimsworth has treated you like a dog; called for a book, for instance,\r\n      and when you gave him the wrong one, or what he chose to consider the\r\n      wrong one, flung it back almost in your face; desired you to shut or open\r\n      the door as if you had been his flunkey; to say nothing of your position\r\n      at the party about a month ago, where you had neither place nor partner,\r\n      but hovered about like a poor, shabby hanger-on; and how patient you were\r\n      under each and all of these circumstances!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, Mr. Hunsden, what then?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI can hardly tell you what then; the conclusion to be drawn as to your\r\n      character depends upon the nature of the motives which guide your conduct;\r\n      if you are patient because you expect to make something eventually out of\r\n      Crimsworth, notwithstanding his tyranny, or perhaps by means of it, you\r\n      are what the world calls an interested and mercenary, but may be a very\r\n      wise fellow; if you are patient because you think it a duty to meet insult\r\n      with submission, you are an essential sap, and in no shape the man for my\r\n      money; if you are patient because your nature is phlegmatic, flat,\r\n      inexcitable, and that you cannot get up to the pitch of resistance, why,\r\n      God made you to be crushed; and lie down by all means, and lie flat, and\r\n      let Juggernaut ride well over you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mr. Hunsden\u2019s eloquence was not, it will be perceived, of the smooth and\r\n      oily order. As he spoke, he pleased me ill. I seem to recognize in him one\r\n      of those characters who, sensitive enough themselves, are selfishly\r\n      relentless towards the sensitiveness of others. Moreover, though he was\r\n      neither like Crimsworth nor Lord Tynedale, yet he was acrid, and, I\r\n      suspected, overbearing in his way: there was a tone of despotism in the\r\n      urgency of the very reproaches by which he aimed at goading the oppressed\r\n      into rebellion against the oppressor. Looking at him still more fixedly\r\n      than I had yet done, I saw written in his eye and mien a resolution to\r\n      arrogate to himself a freedom so unlimited that it might often trench on\r\n      the just liberty of his neighbours. I rapidly ran over these thoughts, and\r\n      then I laughed a low and involuntary laugh, moved thereto by a slight\r\n      inward revelation of the inconsistency of man. It was as I thought:\r\n      Hunsden had expected me to take with calm his incorrect and offensive\r\n      surmises, his bitter and haughty taunts; and himself was chafed by a\r\n      laugh, scarce louder than a whisper.\r\n    \n\r\n      His brow darkened, his thin nostril dilated a little.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he began, \u201cI told you that you were an aristocrat, and who but an\r\n      aristocrat would laugh such a laugh as that, and look such a look? A laugh\r\n      frigidly jeering; a look lazily mutinous; gentlemanlike irony, patrician\r\n      resentment. What a nobleman you would have made, William Crimsworth! You\r\n      are cut out for one; pity Fortune has baulked Nature! Look at the\r\n      features, figure, even to the hands\u2014distinction all over\u2014ugly\r\n      distinction! Now, if you\u2019d only an estate and a mansion, and a park, and a\r\n      title, how you could play the exclusive, maintain the rights of your\r\n      class, train your tenantry in habits of respect to the peerage, oppose at\r\n      every step the advancing power of the people, support your rotten order,\r\n      and be ready for its sake to wade knee-deep in churls\u2019 blood; as it is,\r\n      you\u2019ve no power; you can do nothing; you\u2019re wrecked and stranded on the\r\n      shores of commerce; forced into collision with practical men, with whom\r\n      you cannot cope, for you\u2019ll never be a tradesman.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The first part of Hunsden\u2019s speech moved me not at all, or, if it did, it\r\n      was only to wonder at the perversion into which prejudice had twisted his\r\n      judgment of my character; the concluding sentence, however, not only\r\n      moved, but shook me; the blow it gave was a severe one, because Truth\r\n      wielded the weapon. If I smiled now, it, was only in disdain of myself.\r\n    \n\r\n      Hunsden saw his advantage; he followed it up.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll make nothing by trade,\u201d continued he; \u201cnothing more than the crust\r\n      of dry bread and the draught of fair water on which you now live; your\r\n      only chance of getting a competency lies in marrying a rich widow, or\r\n      running away with an heiress.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI leave such shifts to be put in practice by those who devise them,\u201d said\r\n      I, rising.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnd even that is hopeless,\u201d he went on coolly. \u201cWhat widow would have\r\n      you? Much less, what heiress? You\u2019re not bold and venturesome enough for\r\n      the one, nor handsome and fascinating enough for the other. You think\r\n      perhaps you look intelligent and polished; carry your intellect and\r\n      refinement to market, and tell me in a private note what price is bid for\r\n      them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mr. Hunsden had taken his tone for the night; the string he struck was out\r\n      of tune, he would finger no other. Averse to discord, of which I had\r\n      enough every day and all day long, I concluded, at last, that silence and\r\n      solitude were preferable to jarring converse; I bade him good-night.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Are you going, lad? Well, good-night: you\u2019ll find the door.\u201d And he\r\n      sat still in front of the fire, while I left the room and the house. I had\r\n      got a good way on my return to my lodgings before I found out that I was\r\n      walking very fast, and breathing very hard, and that my nails were almost\r\n      stuck into the palms of my clenched hands, and that my teeth were set\r\n      fast; on making this discovery, I relaxed both my pace, fists, and jaws,\r\n      but I could not so soon cause the regrets rushing rapidly through my mind\r\n      to slacken their tide. Why did I make myself a tradesman? Why did I enter\r\n      Hunsden\u2019s house this evening? Why, at dawn to-morrow, must I repair to\r\n      Crimsworth\u2019s mill? All that night did I ask myself these questions, and\r\n      all that night fiercely demanded of my soul an answer. I got no sleep; my\r\n      head burned, my feet froze; at last the factory bells rang, and I sprang\r\n      from my bed with other slaves.\r\n    \n"}
{"5": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER V.\r\n    \n\r\n      THERE is a climax to everything, to every state of feeling as well as to\r\n      every position in life. I turned this truism over in my mind as, in the\r\n      frosty dawn of a January morning, I hurried down the steep and now icy\r\n      street which descended from Mrs. King\u2019s to the Close. The factory\r\n      workpeople had preceded me by nearly an hour, and the mill was all lighted\r\n      up and in full operation when I reached it. I repaired to my post in the\r\n      counting-house as usual; the fire there, but just lit, as yet only smoked;\r\n      Steighton had not yet arrived. I shut the door and sat down at the desk;\r\n      my hands, recently washed in half-frozen water, were still numb; I could\r\n      not write till they had regained vitality, so I went on thinking, and\r\n      still the theme of my thoughts was the \u201cclimax.\u201d Self-dissatisfaction\r\n      troubled exceedingly the current of my meditations.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCome, William Crimsworth,\u201d said my conscience, or whatever it is that\r\n      within ourselves takes ourselves to task\u2014\u201ccome, get a clear notion\r\n      of what you would have, or what you would not have. You talk of a climax;\r\n      pray has your endurance reached its climax? It is not four months old.\r\n      What a fine resolute fellow you imagined yourself to be when you told\r\n      Tynedale you would tread in your father\u2019s steps, and a pretty treading you\r\n      are likely to make of it! How well you like X\u2014\u2014! Just at this\r\n      moment how redolent of pleasant associations are its streets, its shops,\r\n      its warehouses, its factories! How the prospect of this day cheers you!\r\n      Letter-copying till noon, solitary dinner at your lodgings, letter-copying\r\n      till evening, solitude; for you neither find pleasure in Brown\u2019s, nor\r\n      Smith\u2019s, nor Nicholl\u2019s, nor Eccle\u2019s company; and as to Hunsden, you\r\n      fancied there was pleasure to be derived from his society\u2014he! he!\r\n      how did you like the taste you had of him last night? was it sweet? Yet he\r\n      is a talented, an original-minded man, and even he does not like you; your\r\n      self-respect defies you to like him; he has always seen you to\r\n      disadvantage; he always will see you to disadvantage; your positions are\r\n      unequal, and were they on the same level your minds could not assimilate;\r\n      never hope, then, to gather the honey of friendship out of that\r\n      thorn-guarded plant. Hello, Crimsworth! where are your thoughts tending?\r\n      You leave the recollection of Hunsden as a bee would a rock, as a bird a\r\n      desert; and your aspirations spread eager wings towards a land of visions\r\n      where, now in advancing daylight\u2014in X\u2014\u2014 daylight\u2014you\r\n      dare to dream of congeniality, repose, union. Those three you will never\r\n      meet in this world; they are angels. The souls of just men made perfect\r\n      may encounter them in heaven, but your soul will never be made perfect.\r\n      Eight o\u2019clock strikes! your hands are thawed, get to work!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWork? why should I work?\u201d said I sullenly: \u201cI cannot please though I toil\r\n      like a slave.\u201d \u201cWork, work!\u201d reiterated the inward voice. \u201cI may work, it\r\n      will do no good,\u201d I growled; but nevertheless I drew out a packet of\r\n      letters and commenced my task\u2014task thankless and bitter as that of\r\n      the Israelite crawling over the sun-baked fields of Egypt in search of\r\n      straw and stubble wherewith to accomplish his tale of bricks.\r\n    \n\r\n      About ten o\u2019clock I heard Mr. Crimsworth\u2019s gig turn into the yard, and in\r\n      a minute or two he entered the counting-house. It was his custom to glance\r\n      his eye at Steighton and myself, to hang up his mackintosh, stand a minute\r\n      with his back to the fire, and then walk out. Today he did not deviate\r\n      from his usual habits; the only difference was that when he looked at me,\r\n      his brow, instead of being merely hard, was surly; his eye, instead of\r\n      being cold, was fierce. He studied me a minute or two longer than usual,\r\n      but went out in silence.\r\n    \n\r\n      Twelve o\u2019clock arrived; the bell rang for a suspension of labour; the\r\n      workpeople went off to their dinners; Steighton, too, departed, desiring\r\n      me to lock the counting-house door, and take the key with me. I was tying\r\n      up a bundle of papers, and putting them in their place, preparatory to\r\n      closing my desk, when Crimsworth reappeared at the door, and entering\r\n      closed it behind him.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here a minute,\u201d said he, in a deep, brutal voice, while his\r\n      nostrils distended and his eye shot a spark of sinister fire.\r\n    \n\r\n      Alone with Edward I remembered our relationship, and remembering that\r\n      forgot the difference of position; I put away deference and careful forms\r\n      of speech; I answered with simple brevity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is time to go home,\u201d I said, turning the key in my desk.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here!\u201d he reiterated. \u201cAnd take your hand off that key! leave\r\n      it in the lock!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d asked I. \u201cWhat cause is there for changing my usual plans?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDo as I order,\u201d was the answer, \u201cand no questions! You are my servant,\r\n      obey me! What have you been about\u2014?\u201d He was going on in the same\r\n      breath, when an abrupt pause announced that rage had for the moment got\r\n      the better of articulation.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou may look, if you wish to know,\u201d I replied. \u201cThere is the open desk,\r\n      there are the papers.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cConfound your insolence! What have you been about?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour work, and have done it well.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHypocrite and twaddler! Smooth-faced, snivelling greasehorn!\u201d (This last\r\n      term is, I believe, purely \u2014\u2014shire, and alludes to the horn of\r\n      black, rancid whale-oil, usually to be seen suspended to cart-wheels, and\r\n      employed for greasing the same.)\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCome, Edward Crimsworth, enough of this. It is time you and I wound up\r\n      accounts. I have now given your service three months\u2019 trial, and I find it\r\n      the most nauseous slavery under the sun. Seek another clerk. I stay no\r\n      longer.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat! do you dare to give me notice? Stop at least for your wages.\u201d He\r\n      took down the heavy gig whip hanging beside his mackintosh.\r\n    \n\r\n      I permitted myself to laugh with a degree of scorn I took no pains to\r\n      temper or hide. His fury boiled up, and when he had sworn half-a-dozen\r\n      vulgar, impious oaths, without, however, venturing to lift the whip, he\r\n      continued:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve found you out and know you thoroughly, you mean, whining\r\n      lickspittle! What have you been saying all over X\u2014\u2014 about me?\r\n      answer me that!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou? I have neither inclination nor temptation to talk about you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou lie! It is your practice to talk about me; it is your constant habit\r\n      to make public complaint of the treatment you receive at my hands. You\r\n      have gone and told it far and near that I give you low wages and knock you\r\n      about like a dog. I wish you were a dog! I\u2019d set-to this minute, and never\r\n      stir from the spot till I\u2019d cut every strip of flesh from your bones with\r\n      this whip.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He flourished his tool. The end of the lash just touched my forehead. A\r\n      warm excited thrill ran through my veins, my blood seemed to give a bound,\r\n      and then raced fast and hot along its channels. I got up nimbly, came\r\n      round to where he stood, and faced him.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDown with your whip!\u201d said I, \u201cand explain this instant what you mean.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSirrah! to whom are you speaking?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTo you. There is no one else present, I think. You say I have been\r\n      calumniating you\u2014complaining of your low wages and bad treatment.\r\n      Give your grounds for these assertions.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Crimsworth had no dignity, and when I sternly demanded an explanation, he\r\n      gave one in a loud, scolding voice.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGrounds! you shall have them; and turn to the light that I may see your\r\n      brazen face blush black, when you hear yourself proved to be a liar and a\r\n      hypocrite. At a public meeting in the Town-hall yesterday, I had the\r\n      pleasure of hearing myself insulted by the speaker opposed to me in the\r\n      question under discussion, by allusions to my private affairs; by cant\r\n      about monsters without natural affection, family despots, and such trash;\r\n      and when I rose to answer, I was met by a shout from the filthy mob, where\r\n      the mention of your name enabled me at once to detect the quarter in which\r\n      this base attack had originated. When I looked round, I saw that\r\n      treacherous villain, Hunsden acting as fugleman. I detected you in close\r\n      conversation with Hunsden at my house a month ago, and I know that you\r\n      were at Hunsden\u2019s rooms last night. Deny it if you dare.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, I shall not deny it! And if Hunsden hounded on the people to hiss\r\n      you, he did quite right. You deserve popular execration; for a worse man,\r\n      a harder master, a more brutal brother than you are has seldom existed.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSirrah! sirrah!\u201d reiterated Crimsworth; and to complete his apostrophe,\r\n      he cracked the whip straight over my head.\r\n    \n\r\n      A minute sufficed to wrest it from him, break it in two pieces, and throw\r\n      it under the grate. He made a headlong rush at me, which I evaded, and\r\n      said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cTouch me, and I\u2019ll have you up before the nearest magistrate.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Men like Crimsworth, if firmly and calmly resisted, always abate something\r\n      of their exorbitant insolence; he had no mind to be brought before a\r\n      magistrate, and I suppose he saw I meant what I said. After an odd and\r\n      long stare at me, at once bull-like and amazed, he seemed to bethink\r\n      himself that, after all, his money gave him sufficient superiority over a\r\n      beggar like me, and that he had in his hands a surer and more dignified\r\n      mode of revenge than the somewhat hazardous one of personal chastisement.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cTake your hat,\u201d said he. \u201cTake what belongs to you, and go out at that\r\n      door; get away to your parish, you pauper: beg, steal, starve, get\r\n      transported, do what you like; but at your peril venture again into my\r\n      sight! If ever I hear of your setting foot on an inch of ground belonging\r\n      to me, I\u2019ll hire a man to cane you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt is not likely you\u2019ll have the chance; once off your premises, what\r\n      temptation can I have to return to them? I leave a prison, I leave a\r\n      tyrant; I leave what is worse than the worst that can lie before me, so no\r\n      fear of my coming back.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGo, or I\u2019ll make you!\u201d exclaimed Crimsworth.\r\n    \n\r\n      I walked deliberately to my desk, took out such of its contents as were my\r\n      own property, put them in my pocket, locked the desk, and placed the key\r\n      on the top.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you abstracting from that desk?\u201d demanded the millowner. \u201cLeave\r\n      all behind in its place, or I\u2019ll send for a policeman to search you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cLook sharp about it, then,\u201d said I, and I took down my hat, drew on my\r\n      gloves, and walked leisurely out of the counting-house\u2014walked out of\r\n      it to enter it no more.\r\n    \n\r\n      I recollect that when the mill-bell rang the dinner hour, before Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth entered, and the scene above related took place, I had had\r\n      rather a sharp appetite, and had been waiting somewhat impatiently to hear\r\n      the signal of feeding time. I forgot it now, however; the images of\r\n      potatoes and roast mutton were effaced from my mind by the stir and tumult\r\n      which the transaction of the last half-hour had there excited. I only\r\n      thought of walking, that the action of my muscles might harmonize with the\r\n      action of my nerves; and walk I did, fast and far. How could I do\r\n      otherwise? A load was lifted off my heart; I felt light and liberated. I\r\n      had got away from Bigben Close without a breach of resolution; without\r\n      injury to my self-respect. I had not forced circumstances; circumstances\r\n      had freed me. Life was again open to me; no longer was its horizon limited\r\n      by the high black wall surrounding Crimsworth\u2019s mill. Two hours had\r\n      elapsed before my sensations had so far subsided as to leave me calm\r\n      enough to remark for what wider and clearer boundaries I had exchanged\r\n      that sooty girdle. When I did look up, lo! straight before me lay\r\n      Grovetown, a village of villas about five miles out of X\u2014\u2014.\r\n      The short winter day, as I perceived from the far-declined sun, was\r\n      already approaching its close; a chill frost-mist was rising from the\r\n      river on which X\u2014\u2014 stands, and along whose banks the road I\r\n      had taken lay; it dimmed the earth, but did not obscure the clear icy blue\r\n      of the January sky. There was a great stillness near and far; the time of\r\n      the day favoured tranquillity, as the people were all employed\r\n      within-doors, the hour of evening release from the factories not being yet\r\n      arrived; a sound of full-flowing water alone pervaded the air, for the\r\n      river was deep and abundant, swelled by the melting of a late snow. I\r\n      stood awhile, leaning over a wall; and looking down at the current: I\r\n      watched the rapid rush of its waves. I desired memory to take a clear and\r\n      permanent impression of the scene, and treasure it for future years.\r\n      Grovetown church clock struck four; looking up, I beheld the last of that\r\n      day\u2019s sun, glinting red through the leafless boughs of some very old oak\r\n      trees surrounding the church\u2014its light coloured and characterized\r\n      the picture as I wished. I paused yet a moment, till the sweet, slow sound\r\n      of the bell had quite died out of the air; then ear, eye and feeling\r\n      satisfied, I quitted the wall and once more turned my face towards X\u2014\u2014.\r\n    \n"}
{"6": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER VI.\r\n    \n\r\n      I RE-ENTERED the town a hungry man; the dinner I had forgotten recurred\r\n      seductively to my recollection; and it was with a quick step and sharp\r\n      appetite I ascended the narrow street leading to my lodgings. It was dark\r\n      when I opened the front door and walked into the house. I wondered how my\r\n      fire would be; the night was cold, and I shuddered at the prospect of a\r\n      grate full of sparkless cinders. To my joyful surprise, I found, on\r\n      entering my sitting-room, a good fire and a clean hearth. I had hardly\r\n      noticed this phenomenon, when I became aware of another subject for\r\n      wonderment; the chair I usually occupied near the hearth was already\r\n      filled; a person sat there with his arms folded on his chest, and his legs\r\n      stretched out on the rug. Short-sighted as I am, doubtful as was the gleam\r\n      of the firelight, a moment\u2019s examination enabled me to recognize in this\r\n      person my acquaintance, Mr. Hunsden. I could not of course be much pleased\r\n      to see him, considering the manner in which I had parted from him the\r\n      night before, and as I walked to the hearth, stirred the fire, and said\r\n      coolly, \u201cGood evening,\u201d my demeanour evinced as little cordiality as I\r\n      felt; yet I wondered in my own mind what had brought him there; and I\r\n      wondered, also, what motives had induced him to interfere so actively\r\n      between me and Edward; it was to him, it appeared, that I owed my welcome\r\n      dismissal; still I could not bring myself to ask him questions, to show\r\n      any eagerness of curiosity; if he chose to explain, he might, but the\r\n      explanation should be a perfectly voluntary one on his part; I thought he\r\n      was entering upon it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou owe me a debt of gratitude,\u201d were his first words.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDo I?\u201d said I; \u201cI hope it is not a large one, for I am much too poor to\r\n      charge myself with heavy liabilities of any kind.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThen declare yourself bankrupt at once, for this liability is a ton\r\n      weight at least. When I came in I found your fire out, and I had it lit\r\n      again, and made that sulky drab of a servant stay and blow at it with the\r\n      bellows till it had burnt up properly; now, say \u2018Thank you!\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot till I have had something to eat; I can thank nobody while I am so\r\n      famished.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I rang the bell and ordered tea and some cold meat.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCold meat!\u201d exclaimed Hunsden, as the servant closed the door, \u201cwhat a\r\n      glutton you are; man! Meat with tea! you\u2019ll die of eating too much.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, Mr. Hunsden, I shall not.\u201d I felt a necessity for contradicting him;\r\n      I was irritated with hunger, and irritated at seeing him there, and\r\n      irritated at the continued roughness of his manner.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is over-eating that makes you so ill-tempered,\u201d said he.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt is like you to give a pragmatical\r\n      opinion without being acquainted with any of the circumstances of the\r\n      case; I have had no dinner.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      What I said was petulant and snappish enough, and Hunsden only replied by\r\n      looking in my face and laughing.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPoor thing!\u201d he whined, after a pause. \u201cIt has had no dinner, has it?\r\n      What! I suppose its master would not let it come home. Did Crimsworth\r\n      order you to fast by way of punishment, William!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, Mr. Hunsden.\u201d Fortunately at this sulky juncture, tea, was brought\r\n      in, and I fell to upon some bread and butter and cold beef directly.\r\n      Having cleared a plateful, I became so far humanized as to intimate to Mr.\r\n      Hunsden that he need not sit there staring, but might come to the table\r\n      and do as I did, if he liked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBut I don\u2019t like in the least,\u201d said he, and therewith he summoned the\r\n      servant by a fresh pull of the bell-rope, and intimated a desire to have a\r\n      glass of toast-and-water. \u201cAnd some more coal,\u201d he added; \u201cMr. Crimsworth\r\n      shall keep a good fire while I stay.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      His orders being executed, he wheeled his chair round to the table, so as\r\n      to be opposite me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d he proceeded. \u201cYou are out of work, I suppose.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said I; and not disposed to show the satisfaction I felt on this\r\n      point, I, yielding to the whim of the moment, took up the subject as\r\n      though I considered myself aggrieved rather than benefited by what had\r\n      been done. \u201cYes\u2014thanks to you, I am. Crimsworth turned me off at a\r\n      minute\u2019s notice, owing to some interference of yours at a public meeting,\r\n      I understand.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh! what! he mentioned that? He observed me signalling the lads, did he?\r\n      What had he to say about his friend Hunsden\u2014anything sweet?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHe called you a treacherous villain.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, he hardly knows me yet! I\u2019m one of those shy people who don\u2019t come\r\n      out all at once, and he is only just beginning to make my acquaintance,\r\n      but he\u2019ll find I\u2019ve some good qualities\u2014excellent ones! The Hunsdens\r\n      were always unrivalled at tracking a rascal; a downright, dishonourable\r\n      villain is their natural prey\u2014they could not keep off him wherever\r\n      they met him; you used the word pragmatical just now\u2014that word is\r\n      the property of our family; it has been applied to us from generation to\r\n      generation; we have fine noses for abuses; we scent a scoundrel a mile\r\n      off; we are reformers born, radical reformers; and it was impossible for\r\n      me to live in the same town with Crimsworth, to come into weekly contact\r\n      with him, to witness some of his conduct to you (for whom personally I\r\n      care nothing; I only consider the brutal injustice with which he violated\r\n      your natural claim to equality)\u2014I say it was impossible for me to be\r\n      thus situated and not feel the angel or the demon of my race at work\r\n      within me. I followed my instinct, opposed a tyrant, and broke a chain.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Now this speech interested me much, both because it brought out Hunsden\u2019s\r\n      character, and because it explained his motives; it interested me so much\r\n      that I forgot to reply to it, and sat silent, pondering over a throng of\r\n      ideas it had suggested.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAre you grateful to me?\u201d he asked, presently.\r\n    \n\r\n      In fact I was grateful, or almost so, and I believe I half liked him at\r\n      the moment, notwithstanding his proviso that what he had done was not out\r\n      of regard for me. But human nature is perverse. Impossible to answer his\r\n      blunt question in the affirmative, so I disclaimed all tendency to\r\n      gratitude, and advised him if he expected any reward for his championship,\r\n      to look for it in a better world, as he was not likely to meet with it\r\n      here. In reply he termed me \u201ca dry-hearted aristocratic scamp,\u201d whereupon\r\n      I again charged him with having taken the bread out of my mouth.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYour bread was dirty, man!\u201d cried Hunsden\u2014\u201cdirty and unwholesome!\r\n      It came through the hands of a tyrant, for I tell you Crimsworth is a\r\n      tyrant,\u2014a tyrant to his workpeople, a tyrant to his clerks, and will\r\n      some day be a tyrant to his wife.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNonsense! bread is bread, and a salary is a salary. I\u2019ve lost mine, and\r\n      through your means.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s sense in what you say, after all,\u201d rejoined Hunsden. \u201cI must say\r\n      I am rather agreeably surprised to hear you make so practical an\r\n      observation as that last. I had imagined now, from my previous observation\r\n      of your character, that the sentimental delight you would have taken in\r\n      your newly regained liberty would, for a while at least, have effaced all\r\n      ideas of forethought and prudence. I think better of you for looking\r\n      steadily to the needful.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cLooking steadily to the needful! How can I do otherwise? I must live, and\r\n      to live I must have what you call \u2018the needful,\u2019 which I can only get by\r\n      working. I repeat it, you have taken my work from me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean to do?\u201d pursued Hunsden coolly. \u201cYou have influential\r\n      relations; I suppose they\u2019ll soon provide you with another place.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cInfluential relations? Who? I should like to know their names.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThe Seacombes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStuff! I have cut them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden looked at me incredulously.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI have,\u201d said I, \u201cand that definitively.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou must mean they have cut you, William.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAs you please. They offered me their patronage on condition of my\r\n      entering the Church; I declined both the terms and the recompence; I\r\n      withdrew from my cold uncles, and preferred throwing myself into my elder\r\n      brother\u2019s arms, from whose affectionate embrace I am now torn by the cruel\r\n      intermeddling of a stranger\u2014of yourself, in short.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I could not repress a half-smile as I said this; a similar\r\n      demi-manifestation of feeling appeared at the same moment on Hunsden\u2019s\r\n      lips.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOh, I see!\u201d said he, looking into my eyes, and it was evident he\r\n      did see right down into my heart. Having sat a minute or two with\r\n      his chin resting on his hand, diligently occupied in the continued perusal\r\n      of my countenance, he went on:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSeriously, have you then nothing to expect from the Seacombes?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, rejection and repulsion. Why do you ask me twice? How can hands\r\n      stained with the ink of a counting-house, soiled with the grease of a\r\n      wool-warehouse, ever again be permitted to come into contact with\r\n      aristocratic palms?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere would be a difficulty, no doubt; still you are such a complete\r\n      Seacombe in appearance, feature, language, almost manner, I wonder they\r\n      should disown you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThey have disowned me; so talk no more about it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDo you regret it, William?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy not, lad?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBecause they are not people with whom I could ever have had any\r\n      sympathy.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI say you are one of them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat merely proves that you know nothing at all about it; I am my\r\n      mother\u2019s son, but not my uncles\u2019 nephew.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStill\u2014one of your uncles is a lord, though rather an obscure and\r\n      not a very wealthy one, and the other a right honourable: you should\r\n      consider worldly interest.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNonsense, Mr. Hunsden. You know or may know that even had I desired to be\r\n      submissive to my uncles, I could not have stooped with a good enough grace\r\n      ever to have won their favour. I should have sacrificed my own comfort and\r\n      not have gained their patronage in return.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery likely\u2014so you calculated your wisest plan was to follow your\r\n      own devices at once?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cExactly. I must follow my own devices\u2014I must, till the day of my\r\n      death; because I can neither comprehend, adopt, nor work out those of\r\n      other people.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden yawned. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cin all this, I see but one thing\r\n      clearly\u2014that is, that the whole affair is no business of mine.\u201d He\r\n      stretched himself and again yawned. \u201cI wonder what time it is,\u201d he went\r\n      on: \u201cI have an appointment for seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThree quarters past six by my watch.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, then I\u2019ll go.\u201d He got up. \u201cYou\u2019ll not meddle with trade again?\u201d\r\n       said he, leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo; I think not.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou would be a fool if you did. Probably, after all, you\u2019ll think better\r\n      of your uncles\u2019 proposal and go into the Church.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA singular regeneration must take place in my whole inner and outer man\r\n      before I do that. A good clergyman is one of the best of men.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndeed! Do you think so?\u201d interrupted Hunsden, scoffingly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI do, and no mistake. But I have not the peculiar points which go to make\r\n      a good clergyman; and rather than adopt a profession for which I have no\r\n      vocation, I would endure extremities of hardship from poverty.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019re a mighty difficult customer to suit. You won\u2019t be a tradesman or a\r\n      parson; you can\u2019t be a lawyer, or a doctor, or a gentleman, because you\u2019ve\r\n      no money. I\u2019d recommend you to travel.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat! without money?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou must travel in search of money, man. You can speak French\u2014with\r\n      a vile English accent, no doubt\u2014still, you can speak it. Go on to\r\n      the Continent, and see what will turn up for you there.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGod knows I should like to go!\u201d exclaimed I with involuntary ardour.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGo: what the deuce hinders you? You may get to Brussels, for instance,\r\n      for five or six pounds, if you know how to manage with economy.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNecessity would teach me if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGo, then, and let your wits make a way for you when you get there. I know\r\n      Brussels almost as well as I know X\u2014\u2014, and I am sure it would\r\n      suit such a one as you better than London.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut occupation, Mr. Hunsden! I must go where occupation is to be had; and\r\n      how could I get recommendation, or introduction, or employment at\r\n      Brussels?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere speaks the organ of caution. You hate to advance a step before you\r\n      know every inch of the way. You haven\u2019t a sheet of paper and a\r\n      pen-and-ink?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI hope so,\u201d and I produced writing materials with alacrity; for I guessed\r\n      what he was going to do. He sat down, wrote a few lines, folded, sealed,\r\n      and addressed a letter, and held it out to me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere, Prudence, there\u2019s a pioneer to hew down the first rough\r\n      difficulties of your path. I know well enough, lad, you are not one of\r\n      those who will run their neck into a noose without seeing how they are to\r\n      get it out again, and you\u2019re right there. A reckless man is my aversion,\r\n      and nothing should ever persuade me to meddle with the concerns of such a\r\n      one. Those who are reckless for themselves are generally ten times more so\r\n      for their friends.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThis is a letter of introduction, I suppose?\u201d said I, taking the epistle.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes. With that in your pocket you will run no risk of finding yourself in\r\n      a state of absolute destitution, which, I know, you will regard as a\r\n      degradation\u2014so should I, for that matter. The person to whom you\r\n      will present it generally has two or three respectable places depending\r\n      upon his recommendation.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat will just suit me,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, and where\u2019s your gratitude?\u201d demanded Mr. Hunsden; \u201cdon\u2019t you know\r\n      how to say \u2018Thank you?\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve fifteen pounds and a watch, which my godmother, whom I never saw,\r\n      gave me eighteen years ago,\u201d was my rather irrelevant answer; and I\r\n      further avowed myself a happy man, and professed that I did not envy any\r\n      being in Christendom.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBut your gratitude?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI shall be off presently, Mr. Hunsden\u2014to-morrow, if all be well:\r\n      I\u2019ll not stay a day longer in X\u2014\u2014 than I\u2019m obliged.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery good\u2014but it will be decent to make due acknowledgment for the\r\n      assistance you have received; be quick! It is just going to strike seven:\r\n      I\u2019m waiting to be thanked.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJust stand out of the way, will you, Mr. Hunsden: I want a key there is\r\n      on the corner of the mantelpiece. I\u2019ll pack my portmanteau before I go to\r\n      bed.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The house clock struck seven.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThe lad is a heathen,\u201d said Hunsden, and taking his hat from a sideboard,\r\n      he left the room, laughing to himself. I had half an inclination to follow\r\n      him: I really intended to leave X\u2014\u2014 the next morning, and\r\n      should certainly not have another opportunity of bidding him good-bye. The\r\n      front door banged to.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cLet him go,\u201d said I, \u201cwe shall meet again some day.\u201d\r\n     \n"}
{"7": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER VII.\r\n    \n\r\n      READER, perhaps you were never in Belgium? Haply you don\u2019t know the\r\n      physiognomy of the country? You have not its lineaments defined upon your\r\n      memory, as I have them on mine?\r\n    \n\r\n      Three\u2014nay four\u2014pictures line the four-walled cell where are\r\n      stored for me the records of the past. First, Eton. All in that picture is\r\n      in far perspective, receding, diminutive; but freshly coloured, green,\r\n      dewy, with a spring sky, piled with glittering yet showery clouds; for my\r\n      childhood was not all sunshine\u2014it had its overcast, its cold, its\r\n      stormy hours. Second, X\u2014\u2014, huge, dingy; the canvas cracked and\r\n      smoked; a yellow sky, sooty clouds; no sun, no azure; the verdure of the\r\n      suburbs blighted and sullied\u2014a very dreary scene.\r\n    \n\r\n      Third, Belgium; and I will pause before this landscape. As to the fourth,\r\n      a curtain covers it, which I may hereafter withdraw, or may not, as suits\r\n      my convenience and capacity. At any rate, for the present it must hang\r\n      undisturbed. Belgium! name unromantic and unpoetic, yet name that whenever\r\n      uttered has in my ear a sound, in my heart an echo, such as no other\r\n      assemblage of syllables, however sweet or classic, can produce. Belgium! I\r\n      repeat the word, now as I sit alone near midnight. It stirs my world of\r\n      the past like a summons to resurrection; the graves unclose, the dead are\r\n      raised; thoughts, feelings, memories that slept, are seen by me ascending\r\n      from the clods\u2014haloed most of them\u2014but while I gaze on their\r\n      vapoury forms, and strive to ascertain definitely their outline, the sound\r\n      which wakened them dies, and they sink, each and all, like a light wreath\r\n      of mist, absorbed in the mould, recalled to urns, resealed in monuments.\r\n      Farewell, luminous phantoms!\r\n    \n\r\n      This is Belgium, reader. Look! don\u2019t call the picture a flat or a dull\r\n      one\u2014it was neither flat nor dull to me when I first beheld it. When I left\r\n      Ostend on a mild February morning, and found myself on the road to\r\n      Brussels, nothing could look vapid to me. My sense of enjoyment possessed\r\n      an edge whetted to the finest, untouched, keen, exquisite. I was young; I\r\n      had good health; pleasure and I had never met; no indulgence of hers had\r\n      enervated or sated one faculty of my nature. Liberty I clasped in my arms\r\n      for the first time, and the influence of her smile and embrace revived my\r\n      life like the sun and the west wind. Yes, at that epoch I felt like a\r\n      morning traveller who doubts not that from the hill he is ascending he\r\n      shall behold a glorious sunrise; what if the track be strait, steep, and\r\n      stony? he sees it not; his eyes are fixed on that summit, flushed already,\r\n      flushed and gilded, and having gained it he is certain of the scene\r\n      beyond. He knows that the sun will face him, that his chariot is even now\r\n      coming over the eastern horizon, and that the herald breeze he feels on\r\n      his cheek is opening for the god\u2019s career a clear, vast path of azure,\r\n      amidst clouds soft as pearl and warm as flame. Difficulty and toil were to\r\n      be my lot, but sustained by energy, drawn on by hopes as bright as vague,\r\n      I deemed such a lot no hardship. I mounted now the hill in shade; there\r\n      were pebbles, inequalities, briars in my path, but my eyes were fixed on\r\n      the crimson peak above; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament\r\n      beyond, and I thought nothing of the stones turning under my feet, or of\r\n      the thorns scratching my face and hands.\r\n    \n\r\n      I gazed often, and always with delight, from the window of the diligence\r\n      (these, be it remembered, were not the days of trains and railroads).\r\n      Well! and what did I see? I will tell you faithfully. Green, reedy swamps;\r\n      fields fertile but flat, cultivated in patches that made them look like\r\n      magnified kitchen-gardens; belts of cut trees, formal as pollard willows,\r\n      skirting the horizon; narrow canals, gliding slow by the road-side;\r\n      painted Flemish farmhouses; some very dirty hovels; a gray, dead sky; wet\r\n      road, wet fields, wet house-tops: not a beautiful, scarcely a picturesque\r\n      object met my eye along the whole route; yet to me, all was beautiful, all\r\n      was more than picturesque. It continued fair so long as daylight lasted,\r\n      though the moisture of many preceding damp days had sodden the whole\r\n      country; as it grew dark, however, the rain recommenced, and it was\r\n      through streaming and starless darkness my eye caught the first gleam of\r\n      the lights of Brussels. I saw little of the city but its lights that\r\n      night. Having alighted from the diligence, a fiacre conveyed me to the\r\n      Hotel de \u2014\u2014, where I had been advised by a fellow-traveller to\r\n      put up; having eaten a traveller\u2019s supper, I retired to bed, and slept a\r\n      traveller\u2019s sleep.\r\n    \n\r\n      Next morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the impression\r\n      that I was yet in X\u2014\u2014, and perceiving it to be broad daylight\r\n      I started up, imagining that I had overslept myself and should be behind\r\n      time at the counting-house. The momentary and painful sense of restraint\r\n      vanished before the revived and reviving consciousness of freedom, as,\r\n      throwing back the white curtains of my bed, I looked forth into a wide,\r\n      lofty foreign chamber; how different from the small and dingy, though not\r\n      uncomfortable, apartment I had occupied for a night or two at a\r\n      respectable inn in London while waiting for the sailing of the packet! Yet\r\n      far be it from me to profane the memory of that little dingy room! It,\r\n      too, is dear to my soul; for there, as I lay in quiet and darkness, I\r\n      first heard the great bell of St. Paul\u2019s telling London it was midnight,\r\n      and well do I recall the deep, deliberate tones, so full charged with\r\n      colossal phlegm and force. From the small, narrow window of that room, I\r\n      first saw the dome, looming through a London mist. I suppose the\r\n      sensations, stirred by those first sounds, first sights, are felt but\r\n      once; treasure them, Memory; seal them in urns, and keep them in safe\r\n      niches! Well\u2014I rose. Travellers talk of the apartments in foreign\r\n      dwellings being bare and uncomfortable; I thought my chamber looked\r\n      stately and cheerful. It had such large windows\u2014crois\u00e9es\r\n      that opened like doors, with such broad, clear panes of glass; such a\r\n      great looking-glass stood on my dressing-table\u2014such a fine mirror\r\n      glittered over the mantelpiece\u2014the painted floor looked so clean and\r\n      glossy; when I had dressed and was descending the stairs, the broad marble\r\n      steps almost awed me, and so did the lofty hall into which they conducted.\r\n      On the first landing I met a Flemish housemaid: she had wooden shoes, a\r\n      short red petticoat, a printed cotton bedgown, her face was broad, her\r\n      physiognomy eminently stupid; when I spoke to her in French, she answered\r\n      me in Flemish, with an air the reverse of civil; yet I thought her\r\n      charming; if she was not pretty or polite, she was, I conceived, very\r\n      picturesque; she reminded me of the female figures in certain Dutch\r\n      paintings I had seen in other years at Seacombe Hall.\r\n    \n\r\n      I repaired to the public room; that, too, was very large and very lofty,\r\n      and warmed by a stove; the floor was black, and the stove was black, and\r\n      most of the furniture was black: yet I never experienced a freer sense of\r\n      exhilaration than when I sat down at a very long, black table (covered,\r\n      however, in part by a white cloth), and, having ordered breakfast, began\r\n      to pour out my coffee from a little black coffee-pot. The stove might be\r\n      dismal-looking to some eyes, not to mine, but it was indisputably very\r\n      warm, and there were two gentlemen seated by it talking in French;\r\n      impossible to follow their rapid utterance, or comprehend much of the\r\n      purport of what they said\u2014yet French, in the mouths of Frenchmen, or\r\n      Belgians (I was not then sensible of the horrors of the Belgian accent)\r\n      was as music to my ears. One of these gentlemen presently discerned me to\r\n      be an Englishman\u2014no doubt from the fashion in which I addressed the\r\n      waiter; for I would persist in speaking French in my execrable\r\n      South-of-England style, though the man understood English. The gentleman,\r\n      after looking towards me once or twice, politely accosted me in very good\r\n      English; I remember I wished to God that I could speak French as well; his\r\n      fluency and correct pronunciation impressed me for the first time with a\r\n      due notion of the cosmopolitan character of the capital I was in; it was\r\n      my first experience of that skill in living languages I afterwards found\r\n      to be so general in Brussels.\r\n    \n\r\n      I lingered over my breakfast as long as I could; while it was there on the\r\n      table, and while that stranger continued talking to me, I was a free,\r\n      independent traveller; but at last the things were removed, the two\r\n      gentlemen left the room; suddenly the illusion ceased, reality and\r\n      business came back. I, a bondsman just released from the yoke, freed for\r\n      one week from twenty-one years of constraint, must, of necessity, resume\r\n      the fetters of dependency. Hardly had I tasted the delight of being\r\n      without a master when duty issued her stern mandate: \u201cGo forth and seek\r\n      another service.\u201d I never linger over a painful and necessary task; I\r\n      never take pleasure before business, it is not in my nature to do so;\r\n      impossible to enjoy a leisurely walk over the city, though I perceived the\r\n      morning was very fine, until I had first presented Mr. Hunsden\u2019s letter of\r\n      introduction, and got fairly on to the track of a new situation. Wrenching\r\n      my mind from liberty and delight, I seized my hat, and forced my reluctant\r\n      body out of the Hotel de \u2014\u2014 into the foreign street.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was a fine day, but I would not look at the blue sky or at the stately\r\n      houses round me; my mind was bent on one thing, finding out \u201cMr. Brown,\r\n      Numero \u2014, Rue Royale,\u201d for so my letter was addressed. By dint of\r\n      inquiry I succeeded; I stood at last at the desired door, knocked, asked\r\n      for Mr. Brown, and was admitted.\r\n    \n\r\n      Being shown into a small breakfast-room, I found myself in the presence of\r\n      an elderly gentleman\u2014very grave, business-like, and\r\n      respectable-looking. I presented Mr. Hunsden\u2019s letter; he received me very\r\n      civilly. After a little desultory conversation he asked me if there was\r\n      anything in which his advice or experience could be of use. I said, \u201cYes,\u201d\r\n       and then proceeded to tell him that I was not a gentleman of fortune,\r\n      travelling for pleasure, but an ex-counting-house clerk, who wanted\r\n      employment of some kind, and that immediately too. He replied that as a\r\n      friend of Mr. Hunsden\u2019s he would be willing to assist me as well as he\r\n      could. After some meditation he named a place in a mercantile house at\r\n      Liege, and another in a bookseller\u2019s shop at Louvain.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cClerk and shopman!\u201d murmured I to myself. \u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. I had\r\n      tried the high stool; I hated it; I believed there were other occupations\r\n      that would suit me better; besides I did not wish to leave Brussels.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI know of no place in Brussels,\u201d answered Mr. Brown, \u201cunless indeed you\r\n      were disposed to turn your attention to teaching. I am acquainted with the\r\n      director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of English\r\n      and Latin.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I thought two minutes, then I seized the idea eagerly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThe very thing, sir!\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBut,\u201d asked he, \u201cdo you understand French well enough to teach Belgian\r\n      boys English?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Fortunately I could answer this question in the affirmative; having\r\n      studied French under a Frenchman, I could speak the language intelligibly\r\n      though not fluently. I could also read it well, and write it decently.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThen,\u201d pursued Mr. Brown, \u201cI think I can promise you the place, for\r\n      Monsieur Pelet will not refuse a professor recommended by me; but come\r\n      here again at five o\u2019clock this afternoon, and I will introduce you to\r\n      him.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The word \u201cprofessor\u201d struck me. \u201cI am not a professor,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOh,\u201d returned Mr. Brown, \u201cprofessor, here in Belgium, means a teacher,\r\n      that is all.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      My conscience thus quieted, I thanked Mr. Brown, and, for the present,\r\n      withdrew. This time I stepped out into the street with a relieved heart;\r\n      the task I had imposed on myself for that day was executed. I might now\r\n      take some hours of holiday. I felt free to look up. For the first time I\r\n      remarked the sparkling clearness of the air, the deep blue of the sky, the\r\n      gay clean aspect of the white-washed or painted houses; I saw what a fine\r\n      street was the Rue Royale, and, walking leisurely along its broad\r\n      pavement, I continued to survey its stately hotels, till the palisades,\r\n      the gates, and trees of the park appearing in sight, offered to my eye a\r\n      new attraction. I remember, before entering the park, I stood awhile to\r\n      contemplate the statue of General Belliard, and then I advanced to the top\r\n      of the great staircase just beyond, and I looked down into a narrow back\r\n      street, which I afterwards learnt was called the Rue d\u2019Isabelle. I well\r\n      recollect that my eye rested on the green door of a rather large house\r\n      opposite, where, on a brass plate, was inscribed, \u201cPensionnat de\r\n      Demoiselles.\u201d Pensionnat! The word excited an uneasy sensation in my mind;\r\n      it seemed to speak of restraint. Some of the demoiselles, externats no\r\n      doubt, were at that moment issuing from the door\u2014I looked for a\r\n      pretty face amongst them, but their close, little French bonnets hid their\r\n      features; in a moment they were gone.\r\n    \n\r\n      I had traversed a good deal of Brussels before five o\u2019clock arrived, but\r\n      punctually as that hour struck I was again in the Rue Royale. Re-admitted\r\n      to Mr. Brown\u2019s breakfast-room, I found him, as before, seated at the\r\n      table, and he was not alone\u2014a gentleman stood by the hearth. Two\r\n      words of introduction designated him as my future master. \u201cM. Pelet, Mr.\r\n      Crimsworth; Mr. Crimsworth, M. Pelet,\u201d a bow on each side finished the\r\n      ceremony. I don\u2019t know what sort of a bow I made; an ordinary one, I\r\n      suppose, for I was in a tranquil, commonplace frame of mind; I felt none\r\n      of the agitation which had troubled my first interview with Edward\r\n      Crimsworth. M. Pelet\u2019s bow was extremely polite, yet not theatrical,\r\n      scarcely French; he and I were presently seated opposite to each other. In\r\n      a pleasing voice, low, and, out of consideration to my foreign ears, very\r\n      distinct and deliberate, M. Pelet intimated that he had just been\r\n      receiving from \u201cle respectable M. Brown,\u201d an account of my attainments and\r\n      character, which relieved him from all scruple as to the propriety of\r\n      engaging me as professor of English and Latin in his establishment;\r\n      nevertheless, for form\u2019s sake, he would put a few questions to test my\r\n      powers. He did, and expressed in flattering terms his satisfaction at my\r\n      answers. The subject of salary next came on; it was fixed at one thousand\r\n      francs per annum, besides board and lodging. \u201cAnd in addition,\u201d suggested\r\n      M. Pelet, \u201cas there will be some hours in each day during which your\r\n      services will not be required in my establishment, you may, in time,\r\n      obtain employment in other seminaries, and thus turn your vacant moments\r\n      to profitable account.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I thought this very kind, and indeed I found afterwards that the terms on\r\n      which M. Pelet had engaged me were really liberal for Brussels;\r\n      instruction being extremely cheap there on account of the number of\r\n      teachers. It was further arranged that I should be installed in my new\r\n      post the very next day, after which M. Pelet and I parted.\r\n    \n\r\n      Well, and what was he like? and what were my impressions concerning him?\r\n      He was a man of about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather\r\n      emaciated figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes\r\n      hollow; his features were pleasing and regular, they had a French turn\r\n      (for M. Pelet was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth and\r\n      parentage), yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments\r\n      was, in his case, softened by a mild blue eye, and a melancholy, almost\r\n      suffering, expression of countenance; his physiognomy was \u201cfine et\r\n      spirituelle.\u201d I use two French words because they define better than any\r\n      English terms the species of intelligence with which his features were\r\n      imbued. He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing personage. I\r\n      wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary characteristics of\r\n      his profession, and almost feared he could not be stern and resolute\r\n      enough for a schoolmaster. Externally at least M. Pelet presented an\r\n      absolute contrast to my late master, Edward Crimsworth.\r\n    \n\r\n      Influenced by the impression I had received of his gentleness, I was a\r\n      good deal surprised when, on arriving the next day at my new employer\u2019s\r\n      house, and being admitted to a first view of what was to be the sphere of\r\n      my future labours, namely the large, lofty, and well-lighted schoolrooms,\r\n      I beheld a numerous assemblage of pupils, boys of course, whose collective\r\n      appearance showed all the signs of a full, flourishing, and\r\n      well-disciplined seminary. As I traversed the classes in company with M.\r\n      Pelet, a profound silence reigned on all sides, and if by chance a murmur\r\n      or a whisper arose, one glance from the pensive eye of this most gentle\r\n      pedagogue stilled it instantly. It was astonishing, I thought, how so mild\r\n      a check could prove so effectual. When I had perambulated the length and\r\n      breadth of the classes, M. Pelet turned and said to me\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWould you object to taking the boys as they are, and testing their\r\n      proficiency in English?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The proposal was unexpected. I had thought I should have been allowed at\r\n      least three days to prepare; but it is a bad omen to commence any career\r\n      by hesitation, so I just stepped to the professor\u2019s desk near which we\r\n      stood, and faced the circle of my pupils. I took a moment to collect my\r\n      thoughts, and likewise to frame in French the sentence by which I proposed\r\n      to open business. I made it as short as possible:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs, prenez vos livres de lecture.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnglais ou Fran\u00e7ais, monsieur?\u201d demanded a thickset, moon-faced young\r\n      Flamand in a blouse. The answer was fortunately easy:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnglais.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I determined to give myself as little trouble as possible in this lesson;\r\n      it would not do yet to trust my unpractised tongue with the delivery of\r\n      explanations; my accent and idiom would be too open to the criticisms of\r\n      the young gentlemen before me, relative to whom I felt already it would be\r\n      necessary at once to take up an advantageous position, and I proceeded to\r\n      employ means accordingly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCommencez!\u201d cried I, when they had all produced their books. The\r\n      moon-faced youth (by name Jules Vanderkelkov, as I afterwards learnt) took\r\n      the first sentence. The \u201clivre de lecture\u201d was the \u201cVicar of Wakefield,\u201d\r\n       much used in foreign schools because it is supposed to contain prime\r\n      samples of conversational English; it might, however, have been a Runic\r\n      scroll for any resemblance the words, as enunciated by Jules, bore to the\r\n      language in ordinary use amongst the natives of Great Britain. My God! how\r\n      he did snuffle, snort, and wheeze! All he said was said in his throat and\r\n      nose, for it is thus the Flamands speak, but I heard him to the end of his\r\n      paragraph without proffering a word of correction, whereat he looked\r\n      vastly self-complacent, convinced, no doubt, that he had acquitted himself\r\n      like a real born and bred \u201cAnglais.\u201d In the same unmoved silence I\r\n      listened to a dozen in rotation, and when the twelfth had concluded with\r\n      splutter, hiss, and mumble, I solemnly laid down the book.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cArr\u00eatez!\u201d said I. There was a pause, during which I regarded them all\r\n      with a steady and somewhat stern gaze; a dog, if stared at hard enough and\r\n      long enough, will show symptoms of embarrassment, and so at length did my\r\n      bench of Belgians. Perceiving that some of the faces before me were\r\n      beginning to look sullen, and others ashamed, I slowly joined my hands,\r\n      and ejaculated in a deep \u201cvoix de poitrine\u201d\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cComme c\u2019est affreux!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      They looked at each other, pouted, coloured, swung their heels; they were\r\n      not pleased, I saw, but they were impressed, and in the way I wished them\r\n      to be. Having thus taken them down a peg in their self-conceit, the next\r\n      step was to raise myself in their estimation; not a very easy thing,\r\n      considering that I hardly dared to speak for fear of betraying my own\r\n      deficiencies.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEcoutez, messieurs!\u201d said I, and I endeavoured to throw into my accents\r\n      the compassionate tone of a superior being, who, touched by the extremity\r\n      of the helplessness, which at first only excited his scorn, deigns at\r\n      length to bestow aid. I then began at the very beginning of the \u201cVicar of\r\n      Wakefield,\u201d and read, in a slow, distinct voice, some twenty pages, they\r\n      all the while sitting mute and listening with fixed attention; by the time\r\n      I had done nearly an hour had elapsed. I then rose and said:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est assez pour aujourd\u2019hui, messieurs; demain nous recommen\u00e7erons, et\r\n      j\u2019esp\u00e8re que tout ira bien.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      With this oracular sentence I bowed, and in company with M. Pelet quitted\r\n      the school-room.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est bien! c\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien!\u201d said my principal as we entered his\r\n      parlour. \u201cJe vois que monsieur a de l\u2019adresse; cela, me plait, car, dans\r\n      l\u2019instruction, l\u2019adresse fait tout autant que le savoir.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      From the parlour M. Pelet conducted me to my apartment, my \u201cchambre,\u201d as\r\n      Monsieur said with a certain air of complacency. It was a very small room,\r\n      with an excessively small bed, but M. Pelet gave me to understand that I\r\n      was to occupy it quite alone, which was of course a great comfort. Yet,\r\n      though so limited in dimensions, it had two windows. Light not being taxed\r\n      in Belgium, the people never grudge its admission into their houses; just\r\n      here, however, this observation is not very apropos, for one of\r\n      these windows was boarded up; the open windows looked into the boys\u2019\r\n      playground. I glanced at the other, as wondering what aspect it would\r\n      present if disencumbered of the boards. M. Pelet read, I suppose, the\r\n      expression of my eye; he explained:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cLa fen\u00eatre ferm\u00e9e donne sur un jardin appartenant a un pensionnat de\r\n      demoiselles,\u201d said he, \u201cet les convenances exigent\u2014enfin, vous\r\n      comprenez\u2014n\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOui, oui,\u201d was my reply, and I looked of course quite satisfied; but when\r\n      M. Pelet had retired and closed the door after him, the first thing I did\r\n      was to scrutinize closely the nailed boards, hoping to find some chink or\r\n      crevice which I might enlarge, and so get a peep at the consecrated\r\n      ground. My researches were vain, for the boards were well joined and\r\n      strongly nailed. It is astonishing how disappointed I felt. I thought it\r\n      would have been so pleasant to have looked out upon a garden planted with\r\n      flowers and trees, so amusing to have watched the demoiselles at their\r\n      play; to have studied female character in a variety of phases, myself the\r\n      while sheltered from view by a modest muslin curtain, whereas, owing\r\n      doubtless to the absurd scruples of some old duenna of a directress, I had\r\n      now only the option of looking at a bare gravelled court, with an enormous\r\n      \u201cpas de geant\u201d in the middle, and the monotonous walls and windows of a\r\n      boys\u2019 school-house round. Not only then, but many a time after, especially\r\n      in moments of weariness and low spirits, did I look with dissatisfied eyes\r\n      on that most tantalizing board, longing to tear it away and get a glimpse\r\n      of the green region which I imagined to lie beyond. I knew a tree grew\r\n      close up to the window, for though there were as yet no leaves to rustle,\r\n      I often heard at night the tapping of branches against the panes. In the\r\n      daytime, when I listened attentively, I could hear, even through the\r\n      boards, the voices of the demoiselles in their hours of recreation, and,\r\n      to speak the honest truth, my sentimental reflections were occasionally a\r\n      trifle disarranged by the not quite silvery, in fact the too often brazen\r\n      sounds, which, rising from the unseen paradise below, penetrated\r\n      clamorously into my solitude. Not to mince matters, it really seemed to me\r\n      a doubtful case whether the lungs of Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s girls or those of M.\r\n      Pelet\u2019s boys were the strongest, and when it came to shrieking the girls\r\n      indisputably beat the boys hollow. I forgot to say, by-the-by, that Reuter\r\n      was the name of the old lady who had had my window bearded up. I say old,\r\n      for such I, of course, concluded her to be, judging from her cautious,\r\n      chaperon-like proceedings; besides, nobody ever spoke of her as young. I\r\n      remember I was very much amused when I first heard her Christian name; it\r\n      was Zora\u00efde\u2014Mademoiselle Zora\u00efde Reuter. But the continental nations\r\n      do allow themselves vagaries in the choice of names, such as we sober\r\n      English never run into. I think, indeed, we have too limited a list to\r\n      choose from.\r\n    \n\r\n      Meantime my path was gradually growing smooth before me. I, in a few\r\n      weeks, conquered the teasing difficulties inseparable from the\r\n      commencement of almost every career. Ere long I had acquired as much\r\n      facility in speaking French as set me at my ease with my pupils; and as I\r\n      had encountered them on a right footing at the very beginning, and\r\n      continued tenaciously to retain the advantage I had early gained, they\r\n      never attempted mutiny, which circumstance, all who are in any degree\r\n      acquainted with the ongoings of Belgian schools, and who know the relation\r\n      in which professors and pupils too frequently stand towards each other in\r\n      those establishments, will consider an important and uncommon one. Before\r\n      concluding this chapter I will say a word on the system I pursued with\r\n      regard to my classes: my experience may possibly be of use to others.\r\n    \n\r\n      It did not require very keen observation to detect the character of the\r\n      youth of Brabant, but it needed a certain degree of tact to adopt one\u2019s\r\n      measures to their capacity. Their intellectual faculties were generally\r\n      weak, their animal propensities strong; thus there was at once an\r\n      impotence and a kind of inert force in their natures; they were dull, but\r\n      they were also singularly stubborn, heavy as lead and, like lead, most\r\n      difficult to move. Such being the case, it would have been truly absurd to\r\n      exact from them much in the way of mental exertion; having short memories,\r\n      dense intelligence, feeble reflective powers, they recoiled with\r\n      repugnance from any occupation that demanded close study or deep thought.\r\n      Had the abhorred effort been extorted from them by injudicious and\r\n      arbitrary measures on the part of the Professor, they would have resisted\r\n      as obstinately, as clamorously, as desperate swine; and though not brave\r\n      singly, they were relentless acting en masse.\r\n    \n\r\n      I understood that before my arrival in M. Pelet\u2019s establishment, the\r\n      combined insubordination of the pupils had effected the dismissal of more\r\n      than one English master. It was necessary then to exact only the most\r\n      moderate application from natures so little qualified to apply\u2014to\r\n      assist, in every practicable way, understandings so opaque and\r\n      contracted\u2014to be ever gentle, considerate, yielding even, to a certain\r\n      point, with dispositions so irrationally perverse; but, having reached\r\n      that culminating point of indulgence, you must fix your foot, plant it,\r\n      root it in rock\u2014become immutable as the towers of Ste. Gudule; for a\r\n      step\u2014but half a step farther, and you would plunge headlong into the gulf\r\n      of imbecility; there lodged, you would speedily receive proofs of Flemish\r\n      gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low\r\n      Country mud. You might smooth to the utmost the path of learning, remove\r\n      every pebble from the track; but then you must finally insist with\r\n      decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself to be led\r\n      quietly along the prepared road. When I had brought down my lesson to the\r\n      lowest level of my dullest pupil\u2019s capacity\u2014when I had shown myself\r\n      the mildest, the most tolerant of masters\u2014a word of impertinence, a\r\n      movement of disobedience, changed me at once into a despot. I offered then\r\n      but one alternative\u2014submission and acknowledgment of error, or\r\n      ignominious expulsion. This system answered, and my influence, by degrees,\r\n      became established on a firm basis. \u201cThe boy is father to the man,\u201d it is\r\n      said; and so I often thought when I looked at my boys and remembered the\r\n      political history of their ancestors. Pelet\u2019s school was merely an epitome\r\n      of the Belgian nation.\r\n    \n"}
{"8": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER VIII.\r\n    \n\r\n      AND Pelet himself? How did I continue to like him? Oh, extremely well!\r\n      Nothing could be more smooth, gentlemanlike, and even friendly, than his\r\n      demeanour to me. I had to endure from him neither cold neglect, irritating\r\n      interference, nor pretentious assumption of superiority. I fear, however,\r\n      two poor, hard-worked Belgian ushers in the establishment could not have\r\n      said as much; to them the director\u2019s manner was invariably dry, stern, and\r\n      cool. I believe he perceived once or twice that I was a little shocked at\r\n      the difference he made between them and me, and accounted for it by\r\n      saying, with a quiet sarcastic smile\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCe ne sont que des Flamands\u2014allez!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And then he took his cigar gently from his lips and spat on the painted\r\n      floor of the room in which we were sitting. Flamands certainly they were,\r\n      and both had the true Flamand physiognomy, where intellectual inferiority\r\n      is marked in lines none can mistake; still they were men, and, in the\r\n      main, honest men; and I could not see why their being aboriginals of the\r\n      flat, dull soil should serve as a pretext for treating them with perpetual\r\n      severity and contempt. This idea of injustice somewhat poisoned the\r\n      pleasure I might otherwise have derived from Pelet\u2019s soft affable manner\r\n      to myself. Certainly it was agreeable, when the day\u2019s work was over, to\r\n      find one\u2019s employer an intelligent and cheerful companion; and if he was\r\n      sometimes a little sarcastic and sometimes a little too insinuating, and\r\n      if I did discover that his mildness was more a matter of appearance than\r\n      of reality\u2014if I did occasionally suspect the existence of flint or\r\n      steel under an external covering of velvet\u2014still we are none of us\r\n      perfect; and weary as I was of the atmosphere of brutality and insolence\r\n      in which I had constantly lived at X\u2014\u2014, I had no inclination\r\n      now, on casting anchor in calmer regions, to institute at once a prying\r\n      search after defects that were scrupulously withdrawn and carefully veiled\r\n      from my view. I was willing to take Pelet for what he seemed\u2014to\r\n      believe him benevolent and friendly until some untoward event should prove\r\n      him otherwise. He was not married, and I soon perceived he had all a\r\n      Frenchman\u2019s, all a Parisian\u2019s notions about matrimony and women. I\r\n      suspected a degree of laxity in his code of morals, there was something so\r\n      cold and blas\u00e9 in his tone whenever he alluded to what he\r\n      called \u201cle beau sexe;\u201d but he was too gentlemanlike to intrude topics I\r\n      did not invite, and as he was really intelligent and really fond of\r\n      intellectual subjects of discourse, he and I always found enough to talk\r\n      about, without seeking themes in the mire. I hated his fashion of\r\n      mentioning love; I abhorred, from my soul, mere licentiousness. He felt\r\n      the difference of our notions, and, by mutual consent, we kept off ground\r\n      debateable.\r\n    \n\r\n      Pelet\u2019s house was kept and his kitchen managed by his mother, a real old\r\n      Frenchwoman; she had been handsome\u2014at least she told me so, and I\r\n      strove to believe her; she was now ugly, as only continental old women can\r\n      be; perhaps, though, her style of dress made her look uglier than she\r\n      really was. Indoors she would go about without cap, her grey hair\r\n      strangely dishevelled; then, when at home, she seldom wore a gown\u2014only\r\n      a shabby cotton camisole; shoes, too, were strangers to her feet, and in\r\n      lieu of them she sported roomy slippers, trodden down at the heels. On the\r\n      other hand, whenever it was her pleasure to appear abroad, as on Sundays\r\n      and f\u00eate-days, she would put on some very brilliant-coloured dress,\r\n      usually of thin texture, a silk bonnet with a wreath of flowers, and a\r\n      very fine shawl. She was not, in the main, an ill-natured old woman, but\r\n      an incessant and most indiscreet talker; she kept chiefly in and about the\r\n      kitchen, and seemed rather to avoid her son\u2019s august presence; of him,\r\n      indeed, she evidently stood in awe. When he reproved her, his reproofs\r\n      were bitter and unsparing; but he seldom gave himself that trouble.\r\n    \n\r\n      Madame Pelet had her own society, her own circle of chosen visitors, whom,\r\n      however, I seldom saw, as she generally entertained them in what she\r\n      called her \u201ccabinet,\u201d a small den of a place adjoining the kitchen, and\r\n      descending into it by one or two steps. On these steps, by-the-by, I have\r\n      not unfrequently seen Madame Pelet seated with a trencher on her knee,\r\n      engaged in the threefold employment of eating her dinner, gossiping with\r\n      her favourite servant, the housemaid, and scolding her antagonist, the\r\n      cook; she never dined, and seldom indeed took any meal with her son; and\r\n      as to showing her face at the boys\u2019 table, that was quite out of the\r\n      question. These details will sound very odd in English ears, but Belgium\r\n      is not England, and its ways are not our ways.\r\n    \n\r\n      Madame Pelet\u2019s habits of life, then, being taken into consideration, I was\r\n      a good deal surprised when, one Thursday evening (Thursday was always a\r\n      half-holiday), as I was sitting all alone in my apartment, correcting a\r\n      huge pile of English and Latin exercises, a servant tapped at the door,\r\n      and, on its being opened, presented Madame Pelet\u2019s compliments, and she\r\n      would be happy to see me to take my \u201cgo\u00fbter\u201d (a meal which answers to our\r\n      English \u201ctea\u201d) with her in the dining-room.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPlait-il?\u201d said I, for I thought I must have misunderstood, the message\r\n      and invitation were so unusual; the same words were repeated. I accepted,\r\n      of course, and as I descended the stairs, I wondered what whim had entered\r\n      the old lady\u2019s brain; her son was out\u2014gone to pass the evening at\r\n      the Salle of the Grande Harmonie or some other club of which he was a\r\n      member. Just as I laid my hand on the handle of the dining-room door, a\r\n      queer idea glanced across my mind.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSurely she\u2019s not going to make love to me,\u201d said I. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of old\r\n      Frenchwomen doing odd things in that line; and the go\u00fbter? They generally\r\n      begin such affairs with eating and drinking, I believe.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      There was a fearful dismay in this suggestion of my excited imagination,\r\n      and if I had allowed myself time to dwell upon it, I should no doubt have\r\n      cut there and then, rushed back to my chamber, and bolted myself in; but\r\n      whenever a danger or a horror is veiled with uncertainty, the primary wish\r\n      of the mind is to ascertain first the naked truth, reserving the expedient\r\n      of flight for the moment when its dread anticipation shall be realized. I\r\n      turned the door-handle, and in an instant had crossed the fatal threshold,\r\n      closed the door behind me, and stood in the presence of Madame Pelet.\r\n    \n\r\n      Gracious heavens! The first view of her seemed to confirm my worst\r\n      apprehensions. There she sat, dressed out in a light green muslin gown, on\r\n      her head a lace cap with flourishing red roses in the frill; her table was\r\n      carefully spread; there were fruit, cakes, and coffee, with a bottle of\r\n      something\u2014I did not know what. Already the cold sweat started on my\r\n      brow, already I glanced back over my shoulder at the closed door, when, to\r\n      my unspeakable relief, my eye, wandering mildly in the direction of the\r\n      stove, rested upon a second figure, seated in a large fauteuil beside it.\r\n      This was a woman, too, and, moreover, an old woman, and as fat and as\r\n      rubicund as Madame Pelet was meagre and yellow; her attire was likewise\r\n      very fine, and spring flowers of different hues circled in a bright wreath\r\n      the crown of her violet-coloured velvet bonnet.\r\n    \n\r\n      I had only time to make these general observations when Madame Pelet,\r\n      coming forward with what she intended should be a graceful and elastic\r\n      step, thus accosted me:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur is indeed most obliging to quit his books, his studies, at the\r\n      request of an insignificant person like me\u2014will Monsieur complete\r\n      his kindness by allowing me to present him to my dear friend Madame\r\n      Reuter, who resides in the neighbouring house\u2014the young ladies\u2019\r\n      school.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d thought I, \u201cI knew she was old,\u201d and I bowed and took my seat.\r\n      Madame Reuter placed herself at the table opposite to me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow do you like Belgium, Monsieur?\u201d asked she, in an accent of the\r\n      broadest Bruxellois. I could now well distinguish the difference between\r\n      the fine and pure Parisian utterance of M. Pelet, for instance, and the\r\n      guttural enunciation of the Flamands. I answered politely, and then\r\n      wondered how so coarse and clumsy an old woman as the one before me should\r\n      be at the head of a ladies\u2019 seminary, which I had always heard spoken of\r\n      in terms of high commendation. In truth there was something to wonder at.\r\n      Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous, free-living old Flemish fermi\u00e8re,\r\n      or even a ma\u00eetresse d\u2019auberge, than a staid, grave, rigid directrice de\r\n      pensionnat. In general the continental, or at least the Belgian old women\r\n      permit themselves a licence of manners, speech, and aspect, such as our\r\n      venerable granddames would recoil from as absolutely disreputable, and\r\n      Madame Reuter\u2019s jolly face bore evidence that she was no exception to the\r\n      rule of her country; there was a twinkle and leer in her left eye; her\r\n      right she kept habitually half shut, which I thought very odd indeed.\r\n      After several vain attempts to comprehend the motives of these two droll\r\n      old creatures for inviting me to join them at their go\u00fbter, I at last\r\n      fairly gave it up, and resigning myself to inevitable mystification, I sat\r\n      and looked first at one, then at the other, taking care meantime to do\r\n      justice to the confitures, cakes, and coffee, with which they amply\r\n      supplied me. They, too, ate, and that with no delicate appetite, and\r\n      having demolished a large portion of the solids, they proposed a \u201cpetit\r\n      verre.\u201d I declined. Not so Mesdames Pelet and Reuter; each mixed herself\r\n      what I thought rather a stiff tumbler of punch, and placing it on a stand\r\n      near the stove, they drew up their chairs to that convenience, and invited\r\n      me to do the same. I obeyed; and being seated fairly between them, I was\r\n      thus addressed first by Madame Pelet, then by Madame Reuter.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWe will now speak of business,\u201d said Madame Pelet, and she went on to\r\n      make an elaborate speech, which, being interpreted, was to the effect that\r\n      she had asked for the pleasure of my company that evening in order to give\r\n      her friend Madame Reuter an opportunity of broaching an important\r\n      proposal, which might turn out greatly to my advantage.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPourvu que vous soyez sage,\u201d said Madame Reuter, \u201cet \u00e0 vrai dire, vous en\r\n      avez bien l\u2019air. Take one drop of the punch\u201d (or ponche, as she pronounced\r\n      it); \u201cit is an agreeable and wholesome beverage after a full meal.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I bowed, but again declined it. She went on:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI feel,\u201d said she, after a solemn sip\u2014\u201cI feel profoundly the\r\n      importance of the commission with which my dear daughter has entrusted me,\r\n      for you are aware, Monsieur, that it is my daughter who directs the\r\n      establishment in the next house?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh! I thought it was yourself, madame.\u201d Though, indeed, at that moment I\r\n      recollected that it was called Mademoiselle, not Madame Reuter\u2019s\r\n      pensionnat.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI! Oh, no! I manage the house and look after the servants, as my friend\r\n      Madame Pelet does for Monsieur her son\u2014nothing more. Ah! you thought\r\n      I gave lessons in class\u2014did you?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And she laughed loud and long, as though the idea tickled her fancy\r\n      amazingly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMadame is in the wrong to laugh,\u201d I observed; \u201cif she does not give\r\n      lessons, I am sure it is not because she cannot;\u201d and I whipped out a\r\n      white pocket-handkerchief and wafted it, with a French grace, past my\r\n      nose, bowing at the same time.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cQuel charmant jeune homme!\u201d murmured Madame Pelet in a low voice. Madame\r\n      Reuter, being less sentimental, as she was Flamand and not French, only\r\n      laughed again.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou are a dangerous person, I fear,\u201d said she; \u201cif you can forge\r\n      compliments at that rate, Zora\u00efde will positively be afraid of you; but if\r\n      you are good, I will keep your secret, and not tell her how well you can\r\n      flatter. Now, listen what sort of a proposal she makes to you. She has\r\n      heard that you are an excellent professor, and as she wishes to get the\r\n      very best masters for her school (car Zora\u00efde fait tout comme une reine,\r\n      c\u2019est une v\u00e9ritable ma\u00eetresse-femme), she has commissioned me to step over\r\n      this afternoon, and sound Madame Pelet as to the possibility of engaging\r\n      you. Zora\u00efde is a wary general; she never advances without first examining\r\n      well her ground. I don\u2019t think she would be pleased if she knew I had\r\n      already disclosed her intentions to you; she did not order me to go so\r\n      far, but I thought there would be no harm in letting you into the secret,\r\n      and Madame Pelet was of the same opinion. Take care, however, you don\u2019t\r\n      betray either of us to Zora\u00efde\u2014to my daughter, I mean; she is so\r\n      discreet and circumspect herself, she cannot understand that one should\r\n      find a pleasure in gossiping a little\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est absolument comme mon fils!\u201d cried Madame Pelet.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAll the world is so changed since our girlhood!\u201d rejoined the other:\r\n      \u201cyoung people have such old heads now. But to return, Monsieur. Madame\r\n      Pelet will mention the subject of your giving lessons in my daughter\u2019s\r\n      establishment to her son, and he will speak to you; and then to-morrow,\r\n      you will step over to our house, and ask to see my daughter, and you will\r\n      introduce the subject as if the first intimation of it had reached you\r\n      from M. Pelet himself, and be sure you never mention my name, for I would\r\n      not displease Zora\u00efde on any account.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBien! bien!\u201d interrupted I\u2014for all this chatter and circumlocution\r\n      began to bore me very much; \u201cI will consult M. Pelet, and the thing shall\r\n      be settled as you desire. Good evening, mesdames\u2014I am infinitely\r\n      obliged to you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cComment! vous vous en allez d\u00e9j\u00e0?\u201d exclaimed Madame Pelet.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPrenez encore quelquechose, monsieur; une pomme cuite, des biscuits,\r\n      encore une tasse de caf\u00e9?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMerci, merci, madame\u2014au revoir.\u201d And I backed at last out of the\r\n      apartment.\r\n    \n\r\n      Having regained my own room, I set myself to turn over in my mind the\r\n      incident of the evening. It seemed a queer affair altogether, and queerly\r\n      managed; the two old women had made quite a little intricate mess of it;\r\n      still I found that the uppermost feeling in my mind on the subject was one\r\n      of satisfaction. In the first place it would be a change to give lessons\r\n      in another seminary, and then to teach young ladies would be an occupation\r\n      so interesting\u2014to be admitted at all into a ladies\u2019 boarding-school\r\n      would be an incident so new in my life. Besides, thought I, as I glanced\r\n      at the boarded window, \u201cI shall now at last see the mysterious garden: I\r\n      shall gaze both on the angels and their Eden.\u201d\r\n     \n"}
{"9": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER IX.\r\n    \n\r\n      M. PELET could not of course object to the proposal made by Mdlle. Reuter;\r\n      permission to accept such additional employment, should it offer, having\r\n      formed an article of the terms on which he had engaged me. It was,\r\n      therefore, arranged in the course of next day that I should be at liberty\r\n      to give lessons in Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s establishment four afternoons in every\r\n      week.\r\n    \n\r\n      When evening came I prepared to step over in order to seek a conference\r\n      with Mademoiselle herself on the subject; I had not had time to pay the\r\n      visit before, having been all day closely occupied in class. I remember\r\n      very well that before quitting my chamber, I held a brief debate with\r\n      myself as to whether I should change my ordinary attire for something\r\n      smarter. At last I concluded it would be a waste of labour. \u201cDoubtless,\u201d\r\n       thought I, \u201cshe is some stiff old maid; for though the daughter of Madame\r\n      Reuter, she may well number upwards of forty winters; besides, if it were\r\n      otherwise, if she be both young and pretty, I am not handsome, and no\r\n      dressing can make me so, therefore I\u2019ll go as I am.\u201d And off I started,\r\n      cursorily glancing sideways as I passed the toilet-table, surmounted by a\r\n      looking-glass: a thin irregular face I saw, with sunk, dark eyes under a\r\n      large, square forehead, complexion destitute of bloom or attraction;\r\n      something young, but not youthful, no object to win a lady\u2019s love, no butt\r\n      for the shafts of Cupid.\r\n    \n\r\n      I was soon at the entrance of the pensionnat, in a moment I had pulled the\r\n      bell; in another moment the door was opened, and within appeared a passage\r\n      paved alternately with black and white marble; the walls were painted in\r\n      imitation of marble also; and at the far end opened a glass door, through\r\n      which I saw shrubs and a grass-plat, looking pleasant in the sunshine of\r\n      the mild spring evening\u2014for it was now the middle of April.\r\n    \n\r\n      This, then, was my first glimpse of the garden;\r\n      but I had not time to look\r\n      long, the portress, after having answered in the affirmative my question\r\n      as to whether her mistress was at home, opened the folding-doors of a room\r\n      to the left, and having ushered me in, closed them behind me. I found\r\n      myself in a salon with a very well-painted, highly varnished floor; chairs\r\n      and sofas covered with white draperies, a green porcelain stove, walls\r\n      hung with pictures in gilt frames, a gilt pendule and other ornaments on\r\n      the mantelpiece, a large lustre pendent from the centre of the ceiling,\r\n      mirrors, consoles, muslin curtains, and a handsome centre table completed\r\n      the inventory of furniture. All looked extremely clean and glittering, but\r\n      the general effect would have been somewhat chilling had not a second\r\n      large pair of folding-doors, standing wide open, and disclosing another\r\n      and smaller salon, more snugly furnished, offered some relief to the eye.\r\n      This room was carpeted, and therein was a piano, a couch, a\r\n      chiffonniere\u2014above all, it contained a lofty window with a crimson\r\n      curtain, which, being undrawn, afforded another glimpse of the garden,\r\n      through the large, clear panes, round which some leaves of ivy, some\r\n      tendrils of vine were trained.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Creemsvort, n\u2019est ce pas?\u201d said a voice behind me; and, starting\r\n      involuntarily, I turned. I had been so taken up with the contemplation of\r\n      the pretty little salon that I had not noticed the entrance of a person\r\n      into the larger room. It was, however, Mdlle. Reuter who now addressed me,\r\n      and stood close beside me; and when I had bowed with instantaneously\r\n      recovered sang froid\u2014for I am not easily embarrassed\u2014I\r\n      commenced the conversation by remarking on the pleasant aspect of her\r\n      little cabinet, and the advantage she had over M. Pelet in possessing a\r\n      garden.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cshe often thought so;\u201d and added, \u201cit is my garden,\r\n      monsieur, which makes me retain this house, otherwise I should probably\r\n      have removed to larger and more commodious premises long since; but you\r\n      see I could not take my garden with me, and I should scarcely find one so\r\n      large and pleasant anywhere else in town.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I approved her judgment.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBut you have not seen it yet,\u201d said she, rising; \u201ccome to the window and\r\n      take a better view.\u201d I followed her; she opened the sash, and leaning out\r\n      I saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been to me an\r\n      unknown region. It was a long, not very broad strip of cultured ground,\r\n      with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit trees down the middle; there\r\n      was a sort of lawn, a parterre of rose-trees, some flower-borders, and, on\r\n      the far side, a thickly planted copse of lilacs, laburnums, and acacias.\r\n      It looked pleasant, to me\u2014very pleasant, so long a time had elapsed\r\n      since I had seen a garden of any sort. But it was not only on Mdlle.\r\n      Reuter\u2019s garden that my eyes dwelt; when I had taken a view of her\r\n      well-trimmed beds and budding shrubberies, I allowed my glance to come\r\n      back to herself, nor did I hastily withdraw it.\r\n    \n\r\n      I had thought to see a tall, meagre, yellow, conventual image in black,\r\n      with a close white cap, bandaged under the chin like a nun\u2019s head-gear;\r\n      whereas, there stood by me a little and roundly formed woman, who might\r\n      indeed be older than I, but was still young; she could not, I thought, be\r\n      more than six or seven and twenty; she was as fair as a fair Englishwoman;\r\n      she had no cap; her hair was nut-brown, and she wore it in curls; pretty\r\n      her features were not, nor very soft, nor very regular, but neither were\r\n      they in any degree plain, and I already saw cause to deem them expressive.\r\n      What was their predominant cast? Was it sagacity?\u2014sense? Yes, I\r\n      thought so; but I could scarcely as yet be sure. I discovered, however,\r\n      that there was a certain serenity of eye, and freshness of complexion,\r\n      most pleasing to behold. The colour on her cheek was like the bloom on a\r\n      good apple, which is as sound at the core as it is red on the rind.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter and I entered upon business. She said she was not absolutely\r\n      certain of the wisdom of the step she was about to take, because I was so\r\n      young, and parents might possibly object to a professor like me for their\r\n      daughters: \u201cBut it is often well to act on one\u2019s own judgment,\u201d said she,\r\n      \u201cand to lead parents, rather than be led by them. The fitness of a\r\n      professor is not a matter of age; and, from what I have heard, and from\r\n      what I observe myself, I would much rather trust you than M. Ledru, the\r\n      music-master, who is a married man of near fifty.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I remarked that I hoped she would find me worthy of her good opinion; that\r\n      if I knew myself, I was incapable of betraying any confidence reposed in\r\n      me. \u201cDu reste,\u201d said she, \u201cthe surveillance will be strictly attended to.\u201d\r\n       And then she proceeded to discuss the subject of terms. She was very\r\n      cautious, quite on her guard; she did not absolutely bargain, but she\r\n      warily sounded me to find out what my expectations might be; and when she\r\n      could not get me to name a sum, she reasoned and reasoned with a fluent\r\n      yet quiet circumlocution of speech, and at last nailed me down to five\r\n      hundred francs per annum\u2014not too much, but I agreed. Before the\r\n      negotiation was completed, it began to grow a little dusk. I did not\r\n      hasten it, for I liked well enough to sit and hear her talk; I was amused\r\n      with the sort of business talent she displayed. Edward could not have\r\n      shown himself more practical, though he might have evinced more coarseness\r\n      and urgency; and then she had so many reasons, so many explanations; and,\r\n      after all, she succeeded in proving herself quite disinterested and even\r\n      liberal. At last she concluded, she could say no more, because, as I\r\n      acquiesced in all things, there was no further ground for the exercise of\r\n      her parts of speech. I was obliged to rise. I would rather have sat a\r\n      little longer; what had I to return to but my small empty room? And my\r\n      eyes had a pleasure in looking at Mdlle. Reuter, especially now, when the\r\n      twilight softened her features a little, and, in the doubtful dusk, I\r\n      could fancy her forehead as open as it was really elevated, her mouth\r\n      touched with turns of sweetness as well as defined in lines of sense. When\r\n      I rose to go, I held out my hand, on purpose, though I knew it was\r\n      contrary to the etiquette of foreign habits; she smiled, and said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAh! c\u2019est comme tous les Anglais,\u201d but gave me her hand very kindly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is the privilege of my country, Mademoiselle,\u201d said I; \u201cand, remember,\r\n      I shall always claim it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She laughed a little, quite good-naturedly, and with the sort of\r\n      tranquillity obvious in all she did\u2014a tranquillity which soothed and\r\n      suited me singularly, at least I thought so that evening. Brussels seemed\r\n      a very pleasant place to me when I got out again into the street, and it\r\n      appeared as if some cheerful, eventful, upward-tending career were even\r\n      then opening to me, on that selfsame mild, still April night. So\r\n      impressionable a being is man, or at least such a man as I was in those\r\n      days.\r\n    \n"}
{"10": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER X.\r\n    \n\r\n      NEXT day the morning hours seemed to pass very slowly at M. Pelet\u2019s; I\r\n      wanted the afternoon to come that I might go again to the neighbouring\r\n      pensionnat and give my first lesson within its pleasant precincts; for\r\n      pleasant they appeared to me. At noon the hour of recreation arrived; at\r\n      one o\u2019clock we had lunch; this got on the time, and at last St. Gudule\u2019s\r\n      deep bell, tolling slowly two, marked the moment for which I had been\r\n      waiting.\r\n    \n\r\n      At the foot of the narrow back-stairs that descended from my room, I met\r\n      M. Pelet.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cComme vous avez l\u2019air rayonnant!\u201d said he. \u201cJe ne vous ai jamais vu aussi\r\n      gai. Que s\u2019est-il donc pass\u00e9?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cApparemment que j\u2019aime les changements,\u201d replied I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAh! je comprends\u2014c\u2019est cela\u2014soyez sage seulement. Vous \u00eates bien\r\n      jeune\u2014trop jeune pour le r\u00f4le que vous allez jouer; il faut prendre\r\n      garde\u2014savez-vous?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais quel danger y a-t-il?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJe n\u2019en sais rien\u2014ne vous laissez pas aller \u00e0 de vives impressions\u2014voila\r\n      tout.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I laughed: a sentiment of exquisite pleasure played over my nerves at the\r\n      thought that \u201cvives impressions\u201d were likely to be created; it was the\r\n      deadness, the sameness of life\u2019s daily ongoings that had hitherto been my\r\n      bane; my blouse-clad \u201c\u00e9l\u00e8ves\u201d in the boys\u2019 seminary never stirred in me\r\n      any \u201cvives impressions\u201d except it might be occasionally some of anger. I\r\n      broke from M. Pelet, and as I strode down the passage he followed me with\r\n      one of his laughs\u2014a very French, rakish, mocking sound.\r\n    \n\r\n      Again I stood at the neighbouring door, and soon was re-admitted into the\r\n      cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls. I\r\n      followed the portress, and descending a step, and making a turn, I found\r\n      myself in a sort of corridor; a side-door opened, Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s little\r\n      figure, as graceful as it was plump, appeared. I could now see her dress\r\n      in full daylight; a neat, simple mousseline-laine gown fitted her compact\r\n      round shape to perfection\u2014delicate little collar and manchettes of\r\n      lace, trim Parisian brodequins showed her neck, wrists, and feet, to\r\n      complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly upon\r\n      me! Solicitude and business were in her eye\u2014on her forehead; she\r\n      looked almost stern. Her \u201cBon jour, monsieur,\u201d was quite polite, but so\r\n      orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp towel over my\r\n      \u201cvives impressions.\u201d The servant turned back when her mistress appeared,\r\n      and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side with Mdlle. Reuter.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur will give a lesson in the first class to-day,\u201d said she;\r\n      \u201cdictation or reading will perhaps be the best thing to begin with, for\r\n      those are the easiest forms of communicating instruction in a foreign\r\n      language; and, at the first, a master naturally feels a little unsettled.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She was quite right, as I had found from experience; it only remained for\r\n      me to acquiesce. We proceeded now in silence. The corridor terminated in a\r\n      hall, large, lofty, and square; a glass door on one side showed within a\r\n      long narrow refectory, with tables, an armoire, and two lamps; it was\r\n      empty; large glass doors, in front, opened on the playground and garden; a\r\n      broad staircase ascended spirally on the opposite side; the remaining wall\r\n      showed a pair of great folding-doors, now closed, and admitting,\r\n      doubtless, to the classes.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter turned her eye laterally on me, to ascertain, probably,\r\n      whether I was collected enough to be ushered into her sanctum sanctorum. I\r\n      suppose she judged me to be in a tolerable state of self-government, for\r\n      she opened the door, and I followed her through. A rustling sound of\r\n      uprising greeted our entrance; without looking to the right or left, I\r\n      walked straight up the lane between two sets of benches and desks, and\r\n      took possession of the empty chair and isolated desk raised on an estrade,\r\n      of one step high, so as to command one division; the other division being\r\n      under the surveillance of a ma\u00eetresse similarly elevated. At the back of\r\n      the estrade, and attached to a moveable partition dividing this schoolroom\r\n      from another beyond, was a large tableau of wood painted black and\r\n      varnished; a thick crayon of white chalk lay on my desk for the\r\n      convenience of elucidating any grammatical or verbal obscurity which might\r\n      occur in my lessons by writing it upon the tableau; a wet sponge appeared\r\n      beside the chalk, to enable me to efface the marks when they had served\r\n      the purpose intended.\r\n    \n\r\n      I carefully and deliberately made these observations before allowing\r\n      myself to take one glance at the benches before me; having handled the\r\n      crayon, looked back at the tableau, fingered the sponge in order to\r\n      ascertain that it was in a right state of moisture, I found myself cool\r\n      enough to admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me.\r\n    \n\r\n      And first I observed that Mdlle. Reuter had already glided away, she was\r\n      nowhere visible; a ma\u00eetresse or teacher, the one who occupied the\r\n      corresponding estrade to my own, alone remained to keep guard over me; she\r\n      was a little in the shade, and, with my short sight, I could only see that\r\n      she was of a thin bony figure and rather tallowy complexion, and that her\r\n      attitude, as she sat, partook equally of listlessness and affectation.\r\n      More obvious, more prominent, shone on by the full light of the large\r\n      window, were the occupants of the benches just before me, of whom some\r\n      were girls of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, some young women from eighteen\r\n      (as it appeared to me) up to twenty; the most modest attire, the simplest\r\n      fashion of wearing the hair, were apparent in all; and good features,\r\n      ruddy, blooming complexions, large and brilliant eyes, forms full, even to\r\n      solidity, seemed to abound. I did not bear the first view like a stoic; I\r\n      was dazzled, my eyes fell, and in a voice somewhat too low I murmured\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPrenez vos cahiers de dict\u00e9e, mesdemoiselles.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Not so had I bid the boys at Pelet\u2019s take their reading-books. A rustle\r\n      followed, and an opening of desks; behind the lifted lids which\r\n      momentarily screened the heads bent down to search for exercise-books, I\r\n      heard tittering and whispers.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEulalie, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 p\u00e2mer de rire,\u201d observed one.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cComme il a rougi en parlant!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOui, c\u2019est un v\u00e9ritable blanc-bec.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTais-toi, Hortense\u2014il nous \u00e9coute.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And now the lids sank and the heads reappeared; I had marked three, the\r\n      whisperers, and I did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as\r\n      they emerged from their temporary eclipse. It is astonishing what ease and\r\n      courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me; the idea by which\r\n      I had been awed was that the youthful beings before me, with their dark\r\n      nun-like robes and softly braided hair, were a kind of half-angels. The\r\n      light titter, the giddy whisper, had already in some measure relieved my\r\n      mind of that fond and oppressive fancy.\r\n    \n\r\n      The three I allude to were just in front, within half a yard of my\r\n      estrade, and were among the most womanly-looking present. Their names I\r\n      knew afterwards, and may as well mention now; they were Eulalie, Hortense,\r\n      Caroline. Eulalie was tall, and very finely shaped: she was fair, and her\r\n      features were those of a Low Country Madonna; many a \u201cfigure de Vierge\u201d\r\n       have I seen in Dutch pictures exactly resembling hers; there were no\r\n      angles in her shape or in her face, all was curve and roundness\u2014neither\r\n      thought, sentiment, nor passion disturbed by line or flush the equality of\r\n      her pale, clear skin; her noble bust heaved with her regular breathing,\r\n      her eyes moved a little\u2014by these evidences of life alone could I\r\n      have distinguished her from some large handsome figure moulded in wax.\r\n      Hortense was of middle size and stout, her form was ungraceful, her face\r\n      striking, more alive and brilliant than Eulalie\u2019s, her hair was dark\r\n      brown, her complexion richly coloured; there were frolic and mischief in\r\n      her eye: consistency and good sense she might possess, but none of her\r\n      features betokened those qualities.\r\n    \n\r\n      Caroline was little, though evidently full grown; raven-black hair, very\r\n      dark eyes, absolutely regular features, with a colourless olive\r\n      complexion, clear as to the face and sallow about the neck, formed in her\r\n      that assemblage of points whose union many persons regard as the\r\n      perfection of beauty. How, with the tintless pallor of her skin and the\r\n      classic straightness of her lineaments, she managed to look sensual, I\r\n      don\u2019t know. I think her lips and eyes contrived the affair between them,\r\n      and the result left no uncertainty on the beholder\u2019s mind. She was sensual\r\n      now, and in ten years\u2019 time she would be coarse\u2014promise plain was\r\n      written in her face of much future folly.\r\n    \n\r\n      If I looked at these girls with little scruple, they looked at me with\r\n      still less. Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine, and seemed to expect,\r\n      passively but securely, an impromptu tribute to her majestic charms.\r\n      Hortense regarded me boldly, and giggled at the same time, while she said,\r\n      with an air of impudent freedom\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDictez-nous quelquechose de facile pour commen\u00e7er, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Caroline shook her loose ringlets of abundant but somewhat coarse hair\r\n      over her rolling black eyes; parting her lips, as full as those of a\r\n      hot-blooded Maroon, she showed her well-set teeth sparkling between them,\r\n      and treated me at the same time to a smile \u201cde sa fa\u00e7on.\u201d Beautiful as\r\n      Pauline Borghese, she looked at the moment scarcely purer than Lucrece de\r\n      Borgia. Caroline was of noble family. I heard her lady-mother\u2019s character\r\n      afterwards, and then I ceased to wonder at the precocious accomplishments\r\n      of the daughter. These three, I at once saw, deemed themselves the queens\r\n      of the school, and conceived that by their splendour they threw all the\r\n      rest into the shade. In less than five minutes they had thus revealed to\r\n      me their characters, and in less than five minutes I had buckled on a\r\n      breast-plate of steely indifference, and let down a visor of impassible\r\n      austerity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cTake your pens and commence writing,\u201d said I, in as dry and trite a voice\r\n      as if I had been addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co.\r\n    \n\r\n      The dict\u00e9e now commenced. My three belles interrupted me perpetually with\r\n      little silly questions and uncalled-for remarks, to some of which I made\r\n      no answer, and to others replied very quietly and briefly. \u201cComment dit-on\r\n      point et virgule en Anglais, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSemi-colon, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSemi-collong? Ah, comme c\u2019est dr\u00f4le!\u201d (giggle.)\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cJ\u2019ai une si mauvaise plume\u2014impossible d\u2019\u00e9crire!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais, monsieur\u2014je ne sais pas suivre\u2014vous allez si v\u00eete.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJe n\u2019ai rien compris, moi!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Here a general murmur arose, and the teacher, opening her lips for the\r\n      first time, ejaculated\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSilence, mesdemoiselles!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      No silence followed\u2014on the contrary, the three ladies in front began\r\n      to talk more loudly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est si difficile, l\u2019Anglais!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJe d\u00e9teste la dict\u00e9e.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cQuel ennui d\u2019\u00e9crire quelquechose que l\u2019on ne comprend pas!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Some of those behind laughed: a degree of confusion began to pervade the\r\n      class; it was necessary to take prompt measures.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDonnez-moi v\u00f4tre cahier,\u201d said I to Eulalie in an abrupt tone; and\r\n      bending over, I took it before she had time to give it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEt vous, mademoiselle\u2014donnez-moi le v\u00f4tre,\u201d continued I, more mildly,\r\n      addressing a little pale, plain looking girl who sat in the first row of\r\n      the other division, and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest\r\n      and the most attentive in the room; she rose up, walked over to me, and\r\n      delivered her book with a grave, modest curtsey. I glanced over the two\r\n      dictations; Eulalie\u2019s was slurred, blotted, and full of silly\r\n      mistakes\u2014Sylvie\u2019s (such was the name of the ugly little girl) was clearly\r\n      written, it contained no error against sense, and but few faults of\r\n      orthography. I coolly read aloud both exercises, marking the faults\u2014then\r\n      I looked at Eulalie:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est honteux!\u201d said I, and I deliberately tore her dictation in four\r\n      parts, and presented her with the fragments. I returned Sylvie her book\r\n      with a smile, saying\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est bien\u2014je suis content de vous.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Sylvie looked calmly pleased, Eulalie swelled like an incensed turkey, but\r\n      the mutiny was quelled: the conceited coquetry and futile flirtation of\r\n      the first bench were exchanged for a taciturn sullenness, much more\r\n      convenient to me, and the rest of my lesson passed without interruption.\r\n    \n\r\n      A bell clanging out in the yard announced the moment for the cessation of\r\n      school labours. I heard our own bell at the same time, and that of a\r\n      certain public college immediately after. Order dissolved instantly; up\r\n      started every pupil, I hastened to seize my hat, bow to the ma\u00eetresse, and\r\n      quit the room before the tide of externats should pour from the inner\r\n      class, where I knew near a hundred were prisoned, and whose rising tumult\r\n      I already heard.\r\n    \n\r\n      I had scarcely crossed the hall and gained the corridor, when Mdlle.\r\n      Reuter came again upon me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cStep in here a moment,\u201d said she, and she held open the door of the side\r\n      room from whence she had issued on my arrival; it was a\r\n      salle-\u00e0-manger, as\r\n      appeared from the beaufet and the armoire vitr\u00e9e, filled with glass and\r\n      china, which formed part of its furniture. Ere she had closed the door on\r\n      me and herself, the corridor was already filled with day-pupils, tearing\r\n      down their cloaks, bonnets, and cabas from the wooden pegs on which they\r\n      were suspended; the shrill voice of a ma\u00eetresse was heard at intervals\r\n      vainly endeavouring to enforce some sort of order; vainly, I say:\r\n      discipline there was none in these rough ranks, and yet this was\r\n      considered one of the best-conducted schools in Brussels.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, you have given your first lesson,\u201d began Mdlle. Reuter in the most\r\n      calm, equable voice, as though quite unconscious of the chaos from which\r\n      we were separated only by a single wall.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWere you satisfied with your pupils, or did any circumstance in their\r\n      conduct give you cause for complaint? Conceal nothing from me, repose in\r\n      me entire confidence.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Happily, I felt in myself complete power to manage my pupils without aid;\r\n      the enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at\r\n      first, had been a good deal dissipated. I cannot say I was chagrined or\r\n      downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de demoiselles\r\n      presented to my vague ideal of the same community; I was only enlightened\r\n      and amused; consequently, I felt in no disposition to complain to Mdlle.\r\n      Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a\r\n      smile.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA thousand thanks, mademoiselle, all has gone very smoothly.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She looked more than doubtful.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEt les trois demoiselles du premier banc?\u201d said she.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAh! tout va au mieux!\u201d was my answer, and Mdlle. Reuter ceased to\r\n      question me; but her eye\u2014not large, not brilliant, not melting, or\r\n      kindling, but astute, penetrating, practical, showed she was even with me;\r\n      it let out a momentary gleam, which said plainly, \u201cBe as close as you\r\n      like, I am not dependent on your candour; what you would conceal I already\r\n      know.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      By a transition so quiet as to be scarcely perceptible, the directress\u2019s\r\n      manner changed; the anxious business-air passed from her face, and she\r\n      began chatting about the weather and the town, and asking in neighbourly\r\n      wise after M. and Madame Pelet. I answered all her little questions; she\r\n      prolonged her talk, I went on following its many little windings; she sat\r\n      so long, said so much, varied so often the topics of discourse, that it\r\n      was not difficult to perceive she had a particular aim in thus detaining\r\n      me. Her mere words could have afforded no clue to this aim, but her\r\n      countenance aided; while her lips uttered only affable commonplaces, her\r\n      eyes reverted continually to my face. Her glances were not given in full,\r\n      but out of the corners, so quietly, so stealthily, yet I think I lost not\r\n      one. I watched her as keenly as she watched me; I perceived soon that she\r\n      was feeling after my real character; she was searching for salient points,\r\n      and weak points, and eccentric points; she was applying now this test,\r\n      now that, hoping in the end to find some chink, some niche, where she\r\n      could put in her little firm foot and stand upon my neck\u2014mistress of\r\n      my nature. Do not mistake me, reader, it was no amorous influence she\r\n      wished to gain\u2014at that time it was only the power of the politician\r\n      to which she aspired; I was now installed as a professor in her\r\n      establishment, and she wanted to know where her mind was superior to\r\n      mine\u2014by what feeling or opinion she could lead me.\r\n    \n\r\n      I enjoyed the game much, and did not hasten its conclusion; sometimes I\r\n      gave her hopes, beginning a sentence rather weakly, when her shrewd eye\r\n      would light up\u2014she thought she had me; having led her a little way,\r\n      I delighted to turn round and finish with sound, hard sense, whereat her\r\n      countenance would fall. At last a servant entered to announce dinner; the\r\n      conflict being thus necessarily terminated, we parted without having\r\n      gained any advantage on either side: Mdlle. Reuter had not even given me\r\n      an opportunity of attacking her with feeling, and I had managed to baffle\r\n      her little schemes of craft. It was a regular drawn battle. I again held\r\n      out my hand when I left the room, she gave me hers; it was a small and\r\n      white hand, but how cool! I met her eye too in full\u2014obliging her to\r\n      give me a straightforward look; this last test went against me: it left\r\n      her as it found her\u2014moderate, temperate, tranquil; me it\r\n      disappointed.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI am growing wiser,\u201d thought I, as I walked back to M. Pelet\u2019s. \u201cLook at\r\n      this little woman; is she like the women of novelists and romancers? To\r\n      read of female character as depicted in Poetry and Fiction, one would\r\n      think it was made up of sentiment, either for good or bad\u2014here is a\r\n      specimen, and a most sensible and respectable specimen, too, whose staple\r\n      ingredient is abstract reason. No Talleyrand was ever more passionless\r\n      than Zora\u00efde Reuter!\u201d So I thought then; I found afterwards that blunt\r\n      susceptibilities are very consistent with strong propensities.\r\n    \n"}
{"11": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XI.\r\n    \n\r\n      I HAD indeed had a very long talk with the crafty little politician, and\r\n      on regaining my quarters, I found that dinner was half over. To be late at\r\n      meals was against a standing rule of the establishment, and had it been\r\n      one of the Flemish ushers who thus entered after the removal of the soup\r\n      and the commencement of the first course, M. Pelet would probably have\r\n      greeted him with a public rebuke, and would certainly have mulcted him\r\n      both of soup and fish; as it was, that polite though partial gentleman\r\n      only shook his head, and as I took my place, unrolled my napkin, and said\r\n      my heretical grace to myself, he civilly despatched a servant to the\r\n      kitchen, to bring me a plate of \u201cpur\u00e9e aux carrottes\u201d (for this was a\r\n      maigre-day), and before sending away the first course, reserved for me a\r\n      portion of the stock-fish of which it consisted. Dinner being over, the\r\n      boys rushed out for their evening play; Kint and Vandam (the two ushers)\r\n      of course followed them. Poor fellows! if they had not looked so very\r\n      heavy, so very soulless, so very indifferent to all things in heaven above\r\n      or in the earth beneath, I could have pitied them greatly for the\r\n      obligation they were under to trail after those rough lads everywhere and\r\n      at all times; even as it was, I felt disposed to scout myself as a\r\n      privileged prig when I turned to ascend to my chamber, sure to find there,\r\n      if not enjoyment, at least liberty; but this evening (as had often\r\n      happened before) I was to be still farther distinguished.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEh bien, mauvais sujet!\u201d said the voice of M. Pelet behind me, as I set\r\n      my foot on the first step of the stair. \u201cO\u00f9 allez-vous? Venez \u00e0 la\r\n      salle-\u00e0-manger, que je vous gronde un peu.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI beg pardon, monsieur,\u201d said I, as I followed him to his private\r\n      sitting-room, \u201cfor having returned so late\u2014it was not my fault.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat is just what I want to know,\u201d rejoined M. Pelet, as he ushered me\r\n      into the comfortable parlour with a good wood-fire\u2014for the stove had\r\n      now been removed for the season. Having rung the bell he ordered \u201cCoffee\r\n      for two,\u201d and presently he and I were seated, almost in English comfort,\r\n      one on each side of the hearth, a little round table between us, with a\r\n      coffee-pot, a sugar-basin, and two large white china cups. While M. Pelet\r\n      employed himself in choosing a cigar from a box, my thoughts reverted to\r\n      the two outcast ushers, whose voices I could hear even now crying hoarsely\r\n      for order in the playground.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est une grande responsabilit\u00e9, que la surveillance,\u201d observed I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPlait-il?\u201d dit M. Pelet.\r\n    \n\r\n      I remarked that I thought Messieurs Vandam and Kint must sometimes be a\r\n      little fatigued with their labours.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDes b\u00eates de somme\u2014des b\u00eates de somme,\u201d murmured scornfully the\r\n      director. Meantime I offered him his cup of coffee.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cServez-vous mon gar\u00e7on,\u201d said he blandly, when I had put a couple of huge\r\n      lumps of continental sugar into his cup. \u201cAnd now tell me why you stayed\r\n      so long at Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s. I know that lessons conclude, in her\r\n      establishment as in mine, at four o\u2019clock, and when you returned it was\r\n      past five.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMdlle. wished to speak with me, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndeed! on what subject? if one may ask.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle talked about nothing, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA fertile topic! and did she discourse thereon in the schoolroom, before\r\n      the pupils?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo; like you, monsieur, she asked me to walk into her parlour.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd Madame Reuter\u2014the old duenna\u2014my mother\u2019s gossip, was\r\n      there, of course?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur; I had the honour of being quite alone with mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est joli\u2014cela,\u201d observed M. Pelet, and he smiled and looked into\r\n      the fire.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHoni soit qui mal y pense,\u201d murmured I, significantly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cJe connais un peu ma petite voisine\u2014voyez-vous.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIn that case, monsieur will be able to aid me in finding out what was\r\n      mademoiselle\u2019s reason for making me sit before her sofa one mortal hour,\r\n      listening to the most copious and fluent dissertation on the merest\r\n      frivolities.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cShe was sounding your character.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI thought so, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDid she find out your weak point?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat is my weak point?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy, the sentimental. Any woman sinking her shaft deep enough, will at\r\n      last reach a fathomless spring of sensibility in thy breast, Crimsworth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I felt the blood stir about my heart and rise warm to my cheek.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSome women might, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIs Mdlle. Reuter of the number? Come, speak frankly, mon fils; elle est\r\n      encore jeune, plus ag\u00e9e que toi peut-\u00eatre, mais juste assez pour unir la\r\n      tendresse d\u2019une petite maman \u00e0 l\u2019amour d\u2019une epouse d\u00e9vou\u00e9e; n\u2019est-ce pas\r\n      que cela t\u2019irait sup\u00e9rieurement?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur; I should like my wife to be my wife, and not half my\r\n      mother.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cShe is then a little too old for you?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur, not a day too old if she suited me in other things.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIn what does she not suit you, William? She is personally agreeable, is\r\n      she not?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery; her hair and complexion are just what I admire; and her turn of\r\n      form, though quite Belgian, is full of grace.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBravo! and her face? her features? How do you like them?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA little harsh, especially her mouth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes! her mouth,\u201d said M. Pelet, and he chuckled inwardly. \u201cThere is\r\n      character about her mouth\u2014firmness\u2014but she has a very pleasant\r\n      smile; don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cRather crafty.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTrue, but that expression of craft is owing to her eyebrows; have you\r\n      remarked her eyebrows?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I answered that I had not.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have not seen her looking down then?\u201d said he.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt is a treat, notwithstanding. Observe her when she has some knitting,\r\n      or some other woman\u2019s work in hand, and sits the image of peace, calmly\r\n      intent on her needles and her silk, some discussion meantime going on\r\n      around her, in the course of which peculiarities of character are being\r\n      developed, or important interests canvassed; she takes no part in it; her\r\n      humble, feminine mind is wholly with her knitting; none of her features\r\n      move; she neither presumes to smile approval, nor frown disapprobation;\r\n      her little hands assiduously ply their unpretending task; if she can only\r\n      get this purse finished, or this bonnet-grec completed, it is enough for\r\n      her. If gentlemen approach her chair, a deeper quiescence, a meeker\r\n      modesty settles on her features, and clothes her general mien; observe\r\n      then her eyebrows, et d\u00eetes-moi s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas du chat dans l\u2019un et du\r\n      renard dans l\u2019autre.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI will take careful notice the first opportunity,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnd then,\u201d continued M. Pelet, \u201cthe eyelid will flicker, the\r\n      light-coloured lashes be lifted a second, and a blue eye, glancing out\r\n      from under the screen, will take its brief, sly, searching survey, and\r\n      retreat again.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I smiled, and so did Pelet, and after a few minutes\u2019 silence, I asked:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWill she ever marry, do you think?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMarry! Will birds pair? Of course it is both her intention and resolution\r\n      to marry when she finds a suitable match, and no one is better aware than\r\n      herself of the sort of impression she is capable of producing; no one\r\n      likes better to captivate in a quiet way. I am mistaken if she will not\r\n      yet leave the print of her stealing steps on thy heart, Crimsworth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOf her steps? Confound it, no! My heart is not a plank to be walked on.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut the soft touch of a patte de velours will do it no harm.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cShe offers me no patte de velours; she is all form and reserve with me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat to begin with; let respect be the foundation, affection the first\r\n      floor, love the superstructure; Mdlle. Reuter is a skilful architect.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd interest, M. Pelet\u2014interest. Will not mademoiselle consider\r\n      that point?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, no doubt; it will be the cement between every stone. And now we\r\n      have discussed the directress, what of the pupils? N\u2019y a-t-il pas de\r\n      belles \u00e9tudes parmi ces jeunes t\u00eates?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStudies of character? Yes; curious ones, at least, I imagine; but one\r\n      cannot divine much from a first interview.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh, you affect discretion; but tell me now, were you not a little abashed\r\n      before these blooming young creatures?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAt first, yes; but I rallied and got through with all due sang-froid.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt is true, notwithstanding. At first I thought them angels, but they did\r\n      not leave me long under that delusion; three of the eldest and handsomest\r\n      undertook the task of setting me right, and they managed so cleverly that\r\n      in five minutes I knew them, at least, for what they were\u2014three\r\n      arrant coquettes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJe les connais!\u201d exclaimed M. Pelet. \u201cElles sont toujours au premier rang\r\n      \u00e0 l\u2019eglise et \u00e0 la promenade; une blonde superbe, une jolie espi\u00e8gle, une\r\n      belle brune.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cLovely creatures all of them\u2014heads for artists; what a group they\r\n      would make, taken together! Eulalie (I know their names), with her smooth\r\n      braided hair and calm ivory brow. Hortense, with her rich chesnut locks so\r\n      luxuriantly knotted, plaited, twisted, as if she did not know how to\r\n      dispose of all their abundance, with her vermilion lips, damask cheek, and\r\n      roguish laughing eye. And Caroline de Blemont! Ah, there is beauty! beauty\r\n      in perfection. What a cloud of sable curls about the face of a houri! What\r\n      fascinating lips! What glorious black eyes! Your Byron would have\r\n      worshipped her, and you\u2014you cold, frigid islander!\u2014you played\r\n      the austere, the insensible in the presence of an Aphrodite so exquisite?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I might have laughed at the director\u2019s enthusiasm had I believed it real,\r\n      but there was something in his tone which indicated got-up raptures. I\r\n      felt he was only affecting fervour in order to put me off my guard, to\r\n      induce me to come out in return, so I scarcely even smiled. He went on:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cConfess, William, do not the mere good looks of Zora\u00efde Reuter appear\r\n      dowdyish and commonplace compared with the splendid charms of some of her\r\n      pupils?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The question discomposed me, but I now felt plainly that my principal was\r\n      endeavouring (for reasons best known to himself\u2014at that time I could\r\n      not fathom them) to excite ideas and wishes in my mind alien to what was\r\n      right and honourable. The iniquity of the instigation proved its antidote,\r\n      and when he further added:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEach of those three beautiful girls will have a handsome fortune; and\r\n      with a little address, a gentlemanlike, intelligent young fellow like you\r\n      might make himself master of the hand, heart, and purse of any one of the\r\n      trio.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I replied by a look and an interrogative \u201cMonsieur?\u201d which startled him.\r\n    \n\r\n      He laughed a forced laugh, affirmed that he had only been joking, and\r\n      demanded whether I could possibly have thought him in earnest. Just then\r\n      the bell rang; the play-hour was over; it was an evening on which M. Pelet\r\n      was accustomed to read passages from the drama and the belles lettres to\r\n      his pupils. He did not wait for my answer, but rising, left the room,\r\n      humming as he went some gay strain of B\u00e9ranger\u2019s.\r\n    \n"}
{"12": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XII.\r\n    \n\r\n      DAILY, as I continued my attendance at the seminary of Mdlle. Reuter, did\r\n      I find fresh occasions to compare the ideal with the real. What had I\r\n      known of female character previously to my arrival at Brussels? Precious\r\n      little. And what was my notion of it? Something vague, slight, gauzy,\r\n      glittering; now when I came in contact with it I found it to be a palpable\r\n      substance enough; very hard too sometimes, and often heavy; there was\r\n      metal in it, both lead and iron.\r\n    \n\r\n      Let the idealists, the dreamers about earthly angel and human flowers,\r\n      just look here while I open my portfolio and show them a sketch or two,\r\n      pencilled after nature. I took these sketches in the second-class\r\n      schoolroom of Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s establishment, where about a hundred\r\n      specimens of the genus \u201cjeune fille\u201d collected together offered a fertile\r\n      variety of subject. A miscellaneous assortment they were, differing both\r\n      in caste and country; as I sat on my estrade and glanced over the long\r\n      range of desks, I had under my eye French, English, Belgians, Austrians,\r\n      and Prussians. The majority belonged to the class bourgeois; but there\r\n      were many countesses, there were the daughters of two generals and of\r\n      several colonels, captains, and government employ\u00e9s:\r\n      these ladies sat side\r\n      by side with young females destined to be demoiselles de magasins, and\r\n      with some Flamandes, genuine aborigines of the country. In dress all were\r\n      nearly similar, and in manners there was small difference; exceptions\r\n      there were to the general rule, but the majority gave the tone to the\r\n      establishment, and that tone was rough, boisterous, masked by a\r\n      point-blank disregard of all forbearance towards each other or their\r\n      teachers; an eager pursuit by each individual of her own interest and\r\n      convenience; and a coarse indifference to the interest and convenience of\r\n      every one else. Most of them could lie with audacity when it appeared\r\n      advantageous to do so. All understood the art of speaking fair when a\r\n      point was to be gained, and could with consummate skill and at a moment\u2019s\r\n      notice turn the cold shoulder the instant civility ceased to be\r\n      profitable. Very little open quarrelling ever took place amongst them; but\r\n      backbiting and talebearing were universal. Close friendships were\r\n      forbidden by the rules of the school, and no one girl seemed to cultivate\r\n      more regard for another than was just necessary to secure a companion when\r\n      solitude would have been irksome. They were each and all supposed to have\r\n      been reared in utter unconsciousness of vice. The precautions used to keep\r\n      them ignorant, if not innocent, were innumerable. How was it, then, that\r\n      scarcely one of those girls having attained the age of fourteen could look\r\n      a man in the face with modesty and propriety? An air of bold, impudent\r\n      flirtation, or a loose, silly leer, was sure to answer the most ordinary\r\n      glance from a masculine eye. I know nothing of the arcana of the Roman\r\n      Catholic religion, and I am not a bigot in matters of theology, but I\r\n      suspect the root of this precocious impurity, so obvious, so general in\r\n      Popish countries, is to be found in the discipline, if not the doctrines\r\n      of the Church of Rome. I record what I have seen: these girls belonged to\r\n      what are called the respectable ranks of society; they had all been\r\n      carefully brought up, yet was the mass of them mentally depraved. So much\r\n      for the general view: now for one or two selected specimens.\r\n    \n\r\n      The first picture is a full length of Aurelia Koslow, a German fraulein,\r\n      or rather a half-breed between German and Russian. She is eighteen years\r\n      of age, and has been sent to Brussels to finish her education; she is of\r\n      middle size, stiffly made, body long, legs short, bust much developed but\r\n      not compactly moulded, waist disproportionately compressed by an inhumanly\r\n      braced corset, dress carefully arranged, large feet tortured into small\r\n      bottines, head small, hair smoothed, braided, oiled, and gummed to\r\n      perfection; very low forehead, very diminutive and vindictive grey eyes,\r\n      somewhat Tartar features, rather flat nose, rather high-cheek bones, yet\r\n      the ensemble not positively ugly; tolerably good complexion. So much for\r\n      person. As to mind, deplorably ignorant and ill-informed: incapable of\r\n      writing or speaking correctly even German, her native tongue, a dunce in\r\n      French, and her attempts at learning English a mere farce, yet she has\r\n      been at school twelve years; but as she invariably gets her exercises, of\r\n      every description, done by a fellow pupil, and reads her lessons off a\r\n      book concealed in her lap, it is not wonderful that her progress has been\r\n      so snail-like. I do not know what Aurelia\u2019s daily habits of life are,\r\n      because I have not the opportunity of observing her at all times; but from\r\n      what I see of the state of her desk, books, and papers, I should say she\r\n      is slovenly and even dirty; her outward dress, as I have said, is well\r\n      attended to, but in passing behind her bench, I have remarked that her\r\n      neck is gray for want of washing, and her hair, so glossy with gum and\r\n      grease, is not such as one feels tempted to pass the hand over, much less\r\n      to run the fingers through. Aurelia\u2019s conduct in class, at least when I am\r\n      present, is something extraordinary, considered as an index of girlish\r\n      innocence. The moment I enter the room, she nudges her next neighbour and\r\n      indulges in a half-suppressed laugh. As I take my seat on the estrade, she\r\n      fixes her eye on me; she seems resolved to attract, and, if possible,\r\n      monopolize my notice: to this end she launches at me all sorts of looks,\r\n      languishing, provoking, leering, laughing. As I am found quite proof\r\n      against this sort of artillery\u2014for we scorn what, unasked, is\r\n      lavishly offered\u2014she has recourse to the expedient of making noises;\r\n      sometimes she sighs, sometimes groans, sometimes utters inarticulate\r\n      sounds, for which language has no name. If, in walking up the schoolroom,\r\n      I pass near her, she puts out her foot that it may touch mine; if I do not\r\n      happen to observe the manoeuvre, and my boot comes in contact with her\r\n      brodequin, she affects to fall into convulsions of suppressed laughter; if\r\n      I notice the snare and avoid it, she expresses her mortification in sullen\r\n      muttering, where I hear myself abused in bad French, pronounced with an\r\n      intolerable Low German accent.\r\n    \n\r\n      Not far from Mdlle. Koslow sits another young lady by name Ad\u00e8le Dronsart:\r\n      this is a Belgian, rather low of stature, in form heavy, with broad waist,\r\n      short neck and limbs, good red and white complexion, features well\r\n      chiselled and regular, well-cut eyes of a clear brown colour, light brown\r\n      hair, good teeth, age not much above fifteen, but as full-grown as a stout\r\n      young Englishwoman of twenty. This portrait gives the idea of a somewhat\r\n      dumpy but good-looking damsel, does it not? Well, when I looked along the\r\n      row of young heads, my eye generally stopped at this of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s; her gaze\r\n      was ever waiting for mine, and it frequently succeeded in arresting it.\r\n      She was an unnatural-looking being\u2014so young, fresh, blooming, yet so\r\n      Gorgon-like. Suspicion, sullen ill-temper were on her forehead, vicious\r\n      propensities in her eye, envy and panther-like deceit about her mouth. In\r\n      general she sat very still; her massive shape looked as if it could not\r\n      bend much, nor did her large head\u2014so broad at the base, so narrow\r\n      towards the top\u2014seem made to turn readily on her short neck. She had\r\n      but two varieties of expression; the prevalent one a forbidding,\r\n      dissatisfied scowl, varied sometimes by a most pernicious and perfidious\r\n      smile. She was shunned by her fellow-pupils, for, bad as many of them\r\n      were, few were as bad as she.\r\n    \n\r\n      Aurelia and Ad\u00e8le were in the first division of the second class; the\r\n      second division was headed by a pensionnaire named Juanna Trista. This\r\n      girl was of mixed Belgian and Spanish origin; her Flemish mother was dead,\r\n      her Catalonian father was a merchant residing in the \u2014\u2014 Isles,\r\n      where Juanna had been born and whence she was sent to Europe to be\r\n      educated. I wonder that any one, looking at that girl\u2019s head and\r\n      countenance, would have received her under their roof. She had precisely\r\n      the same shape of skull as Pope Alexander the Sixth; her organs of\r\n      benevolence, veneration, conscientiousness, adhesiveness, were singularly\r\n      small, those of self-esteem, firmness, destructiveness, combativeness,\r\n      preposterously large; her head sloped up in the penthouse shape, was\r\n      contracted about the forehead, and prominent behind; she had rather good,\r\n      though large and marked features; her temperament was fibrous and bilious,\r\n      her complexion pale and dark, hair and eyes black, form angular and rigid\r\n      but proportionate, age fifteen.\r\n    \n\r\n      Juanna was not very thin, but she had a gaunt visage, and her \u201cregard\u201d was\r\n      fierce and hungry; narrow as was her brow, it presented space enough for\r\n      the legible graving of two words, Mutiny and Hate; in some one of her\r\n      other lineaments\u2014I think the eye\u2014cowardice had also its distinct\r\n      cipher. Mdlle. Trista thought fit to trouble my first lessons with a\r\n      coarse work-day sort of turbulence; she made noises with her mouth like a\r\n      horse, she ejected her saliva, she uttered brutal expressions; behind and\r\n      below her were seated a band of very vulgar, inferior-looking Flamandes,\r\n      including two or three examples of that deformity of person and imbecility\r\n      of intellect whose frequency in the Low Countries would seem to furnish\r\n      proof that the climate is such as to induce degeneracy of the human mind\r\n      and body; these, I soon found, were completely under her influence, and\r\n      with their aid she got up and sustained a swinish tumult, which I was\r\n      constrained at last to quell by ordering her and two of her tools to rise\r\n      from their seats, and, having kept them standing five minutes, turning\r\n      them bodily out of the schoolroom: the accomplices into a large place\r\n      adjoining called the grands salle; the principal into a cabinet, of which\r\n      I closed the door and pocketed the key. This judgment I executed in the\r\n      presence of Mdlle. Reuter, who looked much aghast at beholding so decided\r\n      a proceeding\u2014the most severe that had ever been ventured on in her\r\n      establishment. Her look of affright I answered with one of composure, and\r\n      finally with a smile, which perhaps flattered, and certainly soothed her.\r\n      Juanna Trista remained in Europe long enough to repay, by malevolence and\r\n      ingratitude, all who had ever done her a good turn; and she then went to\r\n      join her father in the \u2014\u2014 Isles, exulting in the thought that\r\n      she should there have slaves, whom, as she said, she could kick and strike\r\n      at will.\r\n    \n\r\n      These three pictures are from the life. I possess others, as marked and as\r\n      little agreeable, but I will spare my reader the exhibition of them.\r\n    \n\r\n      Doubtless it will be thought that I ought now, by way of contrast, to show\r\n      something charming; some gentle virgin head, circled with a halo, some\r\n      sweet personification of innocence, clasping the dove of peace to her\r\n      bosom. No: I saw nothing of the sort, and therefore cannot portray it. The\r\n      pupil in the school possessing the happiest disposition was a young girl\r\n      from the country, Louise Path; she was sufficiently benevolent and\r\n      obliging, but not well taught nor well mannered; moreover, the plague-spot\r\n      of dissimulation was in her also; honour and principle were unknown to\r\n      her, she had scarcely heard their names. The least exceptionable pupil was\r\n      the poor little Sylvie I have mentioned once before. Sylvie was gentle in\r\n      manners, intelligent in mind; she was even sincere, as far as her religion\r\n      would permit her to be so, but her physical organization was defective;\r\n      weak health stunted her growth and chilled her spirits, and then, destined\r\n      as she was for the cloister, her whole soul was warped to a conventual\r\n      bias, and in the tame, trained subjection of her manner, one read that she\r\n      had already prepared herself for her future course of life, by giving up\r\n      her independence of thought and action into the hands of some despotic\r\n      confessor. She permitted herself no original opinion, no preference of\r\n      companion or employment; in everything she was guided by another. With a\r\n      pale, passive, automaton air, she went about all day long doing what she\r\n      was bid; never what she liked, or what, from innate conviction, she\r\n      thought it right to do. The poor little future religieuse had been early\r\n      taught to make the dictates of her own reason and conscience quite\r\n      subordinate to the will of her spiritual director. She was the model pupil\r\n      of Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s establishment; pale, blighted image, where life\r\n      lingered feebly, but whence the soul had been conjured by Romish\r\n      wizard-craft!\r\n    \n\r\n      A few English pupils there were in this school, and these might be divided\r\n      into two classes. 1st. The continental English\u2014the daughters chiefly\r\n      of broken adventurers, whom debt or dishonour had driven from their own\r\n      country. These poor girls had never known the advantages of settled homes,\r\n      decorous example, or honest Protestant education; resident a few months\r\n      now in one Catholic school, now in another, as their parents wandered from\r\n      land to land\u2014from France to Germany, from Germany to Belgium\u2014they\r\n      had picked up some scanty instruction, many bad habits, losing every\r\n      notion even of the first elements of religion and morals, and acquiring an\r\n      imbecile indifference to every sentiment that can elevate humanity; they\r\n      were distinguishable by an habitual look of sullen dejection, the result\r\n      of crushed self-respect and constant browbeating from their Popish\r\n      fellow-pupils, who hated them as English, and scorned them as heretics.\r\n    \n\r\n      The second class were British English. Of these I did not encounter half a\r\n      dozen during the whole time of my attendance at the seminary; their\r\n      characteristics were clean but careless dress, ill-arranged hair (compared\r\n      with the tight and trim foreigners), erect carriage, flexible figures,\r\n      white and taper hands, features more irregular, but also more intellectual\r\n      than those of the Belgians, grave and modest countenances, a general air\r\n      of native propriety and decency; by this last circumstance alone I could\r\n      at a glance distinguish the daughter of Albion and nursling of\r\n      Protestantism from the foster-child of Rome, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\r\n      of Jesuistry:\r\n      proud, too, was the aspect of these British girls; at once envied and\r\n      ridiculed by their continental associates, they warded off insult with\r\n      austere civility, and met hate with mute disdain; they eschewed\r\n      company-keeping, and in the midst of numbers seemed to dwell isolated.\r\n    \n\r\n      The teachers presiding over this mixed multitude were three in number, all\r\n      French\u2014their names Mdlles. Z\u00e9phyrine, P\u00e9lagie, and Suzette; the two\r\n      last were commonplace personages enough; their look was ordinary, their\r\n      manner was ordinary, their temper was ordinary, their thoughts, feelings,\r\n      and views were all ordinary\u2014were I to write a chapter on the subject\r\n      I could not elucidate it further. Z\u00e9phyrine was somewhat more\r\n      distinguished in appearance and deportment than P\u00e9lagie and Suzette, but\r\n      in character genuine Parisian coquette, perfidious, mercenary, and\r\n      dry-hearted. A fourth ma\u00eetresse I sometimes saw who seemed to come daily\r\n      to teach needlework, or netting, or lace-mending, or some such flimsy art;\r\n      but of her I never had more than a passing glimpse, as she sat in the\r\n      carr\u00e9, with her frames and some dozen of the elder pupils\r\n      about her,\r\n      consequently I had no opportunity of studying her character, or even of\r\n      observing her person much; the latter, I remarked, had a very English air\r\n      for a ma\u00eetresse, otherwise it was not striking; of character I should\r\n      think she possessed but little, as her pupils seemed constantly \u201cen\r\n      revolte\u201d against her authority. She did not reside in the house; her name,\r\n      I think, was Mdlle. Henri.\r\n    \n\r\n      Amidst this assemblage of all that was insignificant and defective, much\r\n      that was vicious and repulsive (by that last epithet many would have\r\n      described the two or three stiff, silent, decently behaved, ill-dressed\r\n      British girls), the sensible, sagacious, affable directress shone like a\r\n      steady star over a marsh full of Jack-o\u2019-lanthorns; profoundly aware of\r\n      her superiority, she derived an inward bliss from that consciousness which\r\n      sustained her under all the care and responsibility inseparable from her\r\n      position; it kept her temper calm, her brow smooth, her manner tranquil.\r\n      She liked\u2014as who would not?\u2014on entering the school-room, to\r\n      feel that her sole presence sufficed to diffuse that order and quiet which\r\n      all the remonstrances, and even commands, of her underlings frequently\r\n      failed to enforce; she liked to stand in comparison, or rather\u2014contrast,\r\n      with those who surrounded her, and to know that in personal as well as\r\n      mental advantages, she bore away the undisputed palm of preference\u2014(the\r\n      three teachers were all plain.) Her pupils she managed with such\r\n      indulgence and address, taking always on herself the office of recompenser\r\n      and eulogist, and abandoning to her subalterns every invidious task of\r\n      blame and punishment, that they all regarded her with deference, if not\r\n      with affection; her teachers did not love her, but they submitted because\r\n      they were her inferiors in everything; the various masters who attended\r\n      her school were each and all in some way or other under her influence;\r\n      over one she had acquired power by her skilful management of his bad\r\n      temper; over another by little attentions to his petty caprices; a third\r\n      she had subdued by flattery; a fourth\u2014a timid man\u2014she kept in\r\n      awe by a sort of austere decision of mien; me, she still watched, still\r\n      tried by the most ingenious tests\u2014she roved round me, baffled, yet\r\n      persevering; I believe she thought I was like a smooth and bare precipice,\r\n      which offered neither jutting stone nor tree-root, nor tuft of grass to\r\n      aid the climber. Now she flattered with exquisite tact, now she moralized,\r\n      now she tried how far I was accessible to mercenary motives, then she\r\n      disported on the brink of affection\u2014knowing that some men are won by\r\n      weakness\u2014anon, she talked excellent sense, aware that others have\r\n      the folly to admire judgment. I found it at once pleasant and easy to\r\n      evade all these efforts; it was sweet, when she thought me nearly won, to\r\n      turn round and to smile in her very eyes, half scornfully, and then to\r\n      witness her scarcely veiled, though mute mortification. Still she\r\n      persevered, and at last, I am bound to confess it, her finger, essaying,\r\n      proving every atom of the casket, touched its secret spring, and for a\r\n      moment the lid sprung open; she laid her hand on the jewel within; whether\r\n      she stole and broke it, or whether the lid shut again with a snap on her\r\n      fingers, read on, and you shall know.\r\n    \n\r\n      It happened that I came one day to give a lesson when I was indisposed; I\r\n      had a bad cold and a cough; two hours\u2019 incessant talking left me very\r\n      hoarse and tired; as I quitted the schoolroom, and was passing along the\r\n      corridor, I met Mdlle. Reuter; she remarked, with an anxious air, that I\r\n      looked very pale and tired. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI was fatigued;\u201d and then,\r\n      with increased interest, she rejoined, \u201cYou shall not go away till you\r\n      have had some refreshment.\u201d She persuaded me to step into the parlour, and\r\n      was very kind and gentle while I stayed. The next day she was kinder\r\n      still; she came herself into the class to see that the windows were\r\n      closed, and that there was no draught; she exhorted me with friendly\r\n      earnestness not to over-exert myself; when I went away, she gave me her\r\n      hand unasked, and I could not but mark, by a respectful and gentle\r\n      pressure, that I was sensible of the favour, and grateful for it. My\r\n      modest demonstration kindled a little merry smile on her countenance; I\r\n      thought her almost charming. During the remainder of the evening, my mind\r\n      was full of impatience for the afternoon of the next day to arrive, that I\r\n      might see her again.\r\n    \n\r\n      I was not disappointed, for she sat in the class during the whole of my\r\n      subsequent lesson, and often looked at me almost with affection. At four\r\n      o\u2019clock she accompanied me out of the schoolroom, asking with solicitude\r\n      after my health, then scolding me sweetly because I spoke too loud and\r\n      gave myself too much trouble; I stopped at the glass-door which led into\r\n      the garden, to hear her lecture to the end; the door was open, it was a\r\n      very fine day, and while I listened to the soothing reprimand, I looked at\r\n      the sunshine and flowers, and felt very happy. The day-scholars began to\r\n      pour from the schoolrooms into the passage.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWill you go into the garden a minute or two,\u201d asked she, \u201ctill they are\r\n      gone?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I descended the steps without answering, but I looked back as much as to\r\n      say\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou will come with me?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      In another minute I and the directress were walking side by side down the\r\n      alley bordered with fruit-trees, whose white blossoms were then in full\r\n      blow as well as their tender green leaves. The sky was blue, the air\r\n      still, the May afternoon was full of brightness and fragrance. Released\r\n      from the stifling class, surrounded with flowers and foliage, with a\r\n      pleasing, smiling, affable woman at my side\u2014how did I feel? Why,\r\n      very enviably. It seemed as if the romantic visions my imagination had\r\n      suggested of this garden, while it was yet hidden from me by the jealous\r\n      boards, were more than realized; and, when a turn in the alley shut out\r\n      the view of the house, and some tall shrubs excluded M. Pelet\u2019s mansion,\r\n      and screened us momentarily from the other houses, rising\r\n      amphitheatre-like round this green spot, I gave my arm to Mdlle. Reuter,\r\n      and led her to a garden-chair, nestled under some lilacs near. She sat\r\n      down; I took my place at her side. She went on talking to me with that\r\n      ease which communicates ease, and, as I listened, a revelation dawned in\r\n      my mind that I was on the brink of falling in love. The dinner-bell rang,\r\n      both at her house and M. Pelet\u2019s; we were obliged to part; I detained her\r\n      a moment as she was moving away.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI want something,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Zora\u00efde naively.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOnly a flower.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGather it then\u2014or two, or twenty, if you like.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014one will do\u2014but you must gather it, and give it to me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat a caprice!\u201d she exclaimed, but she raised herself on her tip-toes,\r\n      and, plucking a beautiful branch of lilac, offered it to me with grace. I\r\n      took it, and went away, satisfied for the present, and hopeful for the\r\n      future.\r\n    \n\r\n      Certainly that May day was a lovely one, and it closed in moonlight night\r\n      of summer warmth and serenity. I remember this well; for, having sat up\r\n      late that evening, correcting devoirs, and feeling weary and a little\r\n      oppressed with the closeness of my small room, I opened the\r\n      often-mentioned boarded window, whose boards, however, I had persuaded old\r\n      Madame Pelet to have removed since I had filled the post of professor in\r\n      the pensionnat de demoiselles, as, from that time, it was no longer\r\n      \u201cinconvenient\u201d for me to overlook my own pupils at their sports. I sat\r\n      down in the window-seat, rested my arm on the sill, and leaned out: above\r\n      me was the clear-obscure of a cloudless night sky\u2014splendid moonlight\r\n      subdued the tremulous sparkle of the stars\u2014below lay the garden,\r\n      varied with silvery lustre and deep shade, and all fresh with dew\u2014a\r\n      grateful perfume exhaled from the closed blossoms of the fruit-trees\u2014not\r\n      a leaf stirred, the night was breezeless. My window looked directly down\r\n      upon a certain walk of Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s garden, called \u201cl\u2019all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue,\u201d\r\n      so named because the pupils were forbidden to enter it on account of its\r\n      proximity to the boys\u2019 school. It was here that the lilacs and laburnums\r\n      grew especially thick; this was the most sheltered nook in the enclosure,\r\n      its shrubs screened the garden-chair where that afternoon I had sat with\r\n      the young directress. I need not say that my thoughts were chiefly with\r\n      her as I leaned from the lattice, and let my eye roam, now over the walks\r\n      and borders of the garden, now along the many-windowed front of the house\r\n      which rose white beyond the masses of foliage. I wondered in what part of\r\n      the building was situated her apartment; and a single light, shining\r\n      through the persiennes of one crois\u00e9e, seemed to direct me to it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cShe watches late,\u201d thought I, \u201cfor it must be now near midnight. She is a\r\n      fascinating little woman,\u201d I continued in voiceless soliloquy; \u201cher image\r\n      forms a pleasant picture in memory; I know she is not what the world calls\r\n      pretty\u2014no matter, there is harmony in her aspect, and I like it; her\r\n      brown hair, her blue eye, the freshness of her cheek, the whiteness of her\r\n      neck, all suit my taste. Then I respect her talent; the idea of marrying a\r\n      doll or a fool was always abhorrent to me: I know that a pretty doll, a\r\n      fair fool, might do well enough for the honeymoon; but when passion\r\n      cooled, how dreadful to find a lump of wax and wood laid in my bosom, a\r\n      half idiot clasped in my arms, and to remember that I had made of this my\r\n      equal\u2014nay, my idol\u2014to know that I must pass the rest of my\r\n      dreary life with a creature incapable of understanding what I said, of\r\n      appreciating what I thought, or of sympathizing with what I felt! \u201cNow,\r\n      Zora\u00efde Reuter,\u201d thought I, \u201chas tact, caract\u00e8re,\r\n      judgment, discretion;\r\n      has she heart? What a good, simple little smile played about her lips when\r\n      she gave me the branch of lilacs! I have thought her crafty, dissembling,\r\n      interested sometimes, it is true; but may not much that looks like cunning\r\n      and dissimulation in her conduct be only the efforts made by a bland\r\n      temper to traverse quietly perplexing difficulties? And as to interest,\r\n      she wishes to make her way in the world, no doubt, and who can blame her?\r\n      Even if she be truly deficient in sound principle, is it not rather her\r\n      misfortune than her fault? She has been brought up a Catholic: had she\r\n      been born an Englishwoman, and reared a Protestant, might she not have\r\n      added straight integrity to all her other excellences? Supposing she were\r\n      to marry an English and Protestant husband, would she not, rational,\r\n      sensible as she is, quickly acknowledge the superiority of right over\r\n      expediency, honesty over policy? It would be worth a man\u2019s while to try\r\n      the experiment; to-morrow I will renew my observations. She knows that I\r\n      watch her: how calm she is under scrutiny! it seems rather to gratify than\r\n      annoy her.\u201d Here a strain of music stole in upon my monologue, and\r\n      suspended it; it was a bugle, very skilfully played, in the neighbourhood\r\n      of the park, I thought, or on the Place Royale. So sweet were the tones,\r\n      so subduing their effect at that hour, in the midst of silence and under\r\n      the quiet reign of moonlight, I ceased to think, that I might listen more\r\n      intently. The strain retreated, its sound waxed fainter and was soon gone;\r\n      my ear prepared to repose on the absolute hush of midnight once more. No.\r\n      What murmur was that which, low, and yet near and approaching nearer,\r\n      frustrated the expectation of total silence? It was some one\r\n      conversing\u2014yes, evidently, an audible, though subdued voice spoke in the\r\n      garden immediately below me. Another answered; the first voice was that of\r\n      a man, the second that of a woman; and a man and a woman I saw coming\r\n      slowly down the alley. Their forms were at first in shade, I could but\r\n      discern a dusk outline of each, but a ray of moonlight met them at the\r\n      termination of the walk, when they were under my very nose, and revealed\r\n      very plainly, very unequivocally, Mdlle. Zora\u00efde Reuter, arm-in-arm, or\r\n      hand-in-hand (I forget which) with my principal, confidant, and\r\n      counsellor, M. Fran\u00e7ois Pelet. And M. Pelet was saying\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA quand donc le jour des noces, ma bien-aim\u00e9e?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And Mdlle. Reuter answered\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMais, Fran\u00e7ois, tu sais bien qu\u2019il me serait impossible de me marier\r\n      avant les vacances.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJune, July, August, a whole quarter!\u201d exclaimed the director. \u201cHow can I\r\n      wait so long?\u2014I who am ready, even now, to expire at your feet with\r\n      impatience!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh! if you die, the whole affair will be settled without any trouble\r\n      about notaries and contracts; I shall only have to order a slight mourning\r\n      dress, which will be much sooner prepared than the nuptial trousseau.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCruel Zora\u00efde! you laugh at the distress of one who loves you so\r\n      devotedly as I do: my torment is your sport; you scruple not to stretch my\r\n      soul on the rack of jealousy; for, deny it as you will, I am certain you\r\n      have cast encouraging glances on that school-boy, Crimsworth; he has\r\n      presumed to fall in love, which he dared not have done unless you had\r\n      given him room to hope.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you say, Fran\u00e7ois? Do you say Crimsworth is in love with me?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOver head and ears.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHas he told you so?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014but I see it in his face: he blushes whenever your name is\r\n      mentioned.\u201d A little laugh of exulting coquetry announced Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s\r\n      gratification at this piece of intelligence (which was a lie, by-the-by\u2014I\r\n      had never been so far gone as that, after all). M. Pelet proceeded to ask\r\n      what she intended to do with me, intimating pretty plainly, and not very\r\n      gallantly, that it was nonsense for her to think of taking such a\r\n      \u201cblanc-bec\u201d as a husband, since she must be at least ten years older than\r\n      I (was she then thirty-two? I should not have thought it). I heard her\r\n      disclaim any intentions on the subject\u2014the director, however, still\r\n      pressed her to give a definite answer.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFran\u00e7ois,\u201d said she, \u201cyou are jealous,\u201d and still she laughed; then, as\r\n      if suddenly recollecting that this coquetry was not consistent with the\r\n      character for modest dignity she wished to establish, she proceeded, in a\r\n      demure voice: \u201cTruly, my dear Fran\u00e7ois, I will not deny that this young\r\n      Englishman may have made some attempts to ingratiate himself with me; but,\r\n      so far from giving him any encouragement, I have always treated him with\r\n      as much reserve as it was possible to combine with civility; affianced as\r\n      I am to you, I would give no man false hopes; believe me, dear friend.\u201d\r\n       Still Pelet uttered murmurs of distrust\u2014so I judged, at least, from\r\n      her reply.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat folly! How could I prefer an unknown foreigner to you? And then\u2014not\r\n      to flatter your vanity\u2014Crimsworth could not bear comparison with you\r\n      either physically or mentally; he is not a handsome man at all; some may\r\n      call him gentleman-like and intelligent-looking, but for my part\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The rest of the sentence was lost in the distance, as the pair, rising\r\n      from the chair in which they had been seated, moved away. I waited their\r\n      return, but soon the opening and shutting of a door informed me that they\r\n      had re-entered the house; I listened a little longer, all was perfectly\r\n      still; I listened more than an hour\u2014at last I heard M. Pelet come in\r\n      and ascend to his chamber. Glancing once more towards the long front of\r\n      the garden-house, I perceived that its solitary light was at length\r\n      extinguished; so, for a time, was my faith in love and friendship. I went\r\n      to bed, but something feverish and fiery had got into my veins which\r\n      prevented me from sleeping much that night.\r\n    \n"}
{"13": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIII.\r\n    \n\r\n      NEXT morning I rose with the dawn, and having dressed myself and stood\r\n      half-an-hour, my elbow leaning on the chest of drawers, considering what\r\n      means I should adopt to restore my spirits, fagged with sleeplessness, to\r\n      their ordinary tone\u2014for I had no intention of getting up a scene\r\n      with M. Pelet, reproaching him with perfidy, sending him a challenge, or\r\n      performing other gambadoes of the sort\u2014I hit at last on the\r\n      expedient of walking out in the cool of the morning to a neighbouring\r\n      establishment of baths, and treating myself to a bracing plunge. The\r\n      remedy produced the desired effect. I came back at seven o\u2019clock steadied\r\n      and invigorated, and was able to greet M. Pelet, when he entered to\r\n      breakfast, with an unchanged and tranquil countenance; even a cordial\r\n      offering of the hand and the flattering appellation of \u201cmon fils,\u201d\r\n       pronounced in that caressing tone with which Monsieur had, of late days\r\n      especially, been accustomed to address me, did not elicit any external\r\n      sign of the feeling which, though subdued, still glowed at my heart. Not\r\n      that I nursed vengeance\u2014no; but the sense of insult and treachery\r\n      lived in me like a kindling, though as yet smothered coal. God knows I am\r\n      not by nature vindictive; I would not hurt a man because I can no longer\r\n      trust or like him; but neither my reason nor feelings are of the\r\n      vacillating order\u2014they are not of that sand-like sort where\r\n      impressions, if soon made, are as soon effaced. Once convinced that my\r\n      friend\u2019s disposition is incompatible with my own, once assured that he is\r\n      indelibly stained with certain defects obnoxious to my principles, and I\r\n      dissolve the connection. I did so with Edward. As to Pelet, the discovery\r\n      was yet new; should I act thus with him? It was the question I placed\r\n      before my mind as I stirred my cup of coffee with a half-pistolet (we\r\n      never had spoons), Pelet meantime being seated opposite, his pallid face\r\n      looking as knowing and more haggard than usual, his blue eye turned, now\r\n      sternly on his boys and ushers, and now graciously on me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCircumstances must guide me,\u201d said I; and meeting Pelet\u2019s false glance\r\n      and insinuating smile, I thanked heaven that I had last night opened my\r\n      window and read by the light of a full moon the true meaning of that\r\n      guileful countenance. I felt half his master, because the reality of his\r\n      nature was now known to me; smile and flatter as he would, I saw his soul\r\n      lurk behind his smile, and heard in every one of his smooth phrases a\r\n      voice interpreting their treacherous import.\r\n    \n\r\n      But Zora\u00efde Reuter? Of course her defection had cut me to the quick? That\r\n      stint must have gone too deep for any consolations of philosophy to be\r\n      available in curing its smart? Not at all. The night fever over, I looked\r\n      about for balm to that wound also, and found some nearer home than at\r\n      Gilead. Reason was my physician; she began by proving that the prize I had\r\n      missed was of little value: she admitted that, physically, Zora\u00efde might\r\n      have suited me, but affirmed that our souls were not in harmony, and that\r\n      discord must have resulted from the union of her mind with mine. She then\r\n      insisted on the suppression of all repining, and commanded me rather to\r\n      rejoice that I had escaped a snare. Her medicament did me good. I felt its\r\n      strengthening effect when I met the directress the next day; its stringent\r\n      operation on the nerves suffered no trembling, no faltering; it enabled me\r\n      to face her with firmness, to pass her with ease. She had held out her\r\n      hand to me\u2014that I did not choose to see. She had greeted me with a\r\n      charming smile\u2014it fell on my heart like light on stone. I passed on\r\n      to the estrade, she followed me; her eye, fastened on my face, demanded of\r\n      every feature the meaning of my changed and careless manner. \u201cI will give\r\n      her an answer,\u201d thought I; and, meeting her gaze full, arresting, fixing\r\n      her glance, I shot into her eyes, from my own, a look, where there was no\r\n      respect, no love, no tenderness, no gallantry; where the strictest\r\n      analysis could detect nothing but scorn, hardihood, irony. I made her bear\r\n      it, and feel it; her steady countenance did not change, but her colour\r\n      rose, and she approached me as if fascinated. She stepped on to the\r\n      estrade, and stood close by my side; she had nothing to say. I would not\r\n      relieve her embarrassment, and negligently turned over the leaves of a\r\n      book.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI hope you feel quite recovered to-day,\u201d at last she said, in a low tone.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnd I, mademoiselle, hope that you took no cold last night in consequence\r\n      of your late walk in the garden.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Quick enough of comprehension, she understood me directly; her face became\r\n      a little blanched\u2014a very little\u2014but no muscle in her rather\r\n      marked features moved; and, calm and self-possessed, she retired from the\r\n      estrade, taking her seat quietly at a little distance, and occupying\r\n      herself with netting a purse. I proceeded to give my lesson; it was a\r\n      \u201cComposition,\u201d i.e., I dictated certain general questions, of which the\r\n      pupils were to compose the answers from memory, access to books being\r\n      forbidden. While Mdlle. Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline, &c., were\r\n      pondering over the string of rather abstruse grammatical interrogatories I\r\n      had propounded, I was at liberty to employ the vacant half hour in further\r\n      observing the directress herself. The green silk purse was progressing\r\n      fast in her hands; her eyes were bent upon it; her attitude, as she sat\r\n      netting within two yards of me, was still yet guarded; in her whole person\r\n      were expressed at once, and with equal clearness, vigilance and repose\u2014a\r\n      rare union! Looking at her, I was forced, as I had often been before, to\r\n      offer her good sense, her wondrous self-control, the tribute of\r\n      involuntary admiration. She had felt that I had withdrawn from her my\r\n      esteem; she had seen contempt and coldness in my eye, and to her, who\r\n      coveted the approbation of all around her, who thirsted after universal\r\n      good opinion, such discovery must have been an acute wound. I had\r\n      witnessed its effect in the momentary pallor of her cheek--cheek unused to\r\n      vary; yet how quickly, by dint of self-control, had she recovered her\r\n      composure! With what quiet dignity she now sat, almost at my side,\r\n      sustained by her sound and vigorous sense; no trembling in her somewhat\r\n      lengthened, though shrewd upper lip, no coward shame on her austere\r\n      forehead!\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere is metal there,\u201d I said, as I gazed. \u201cWould that there were fire\r\n      also, living ardour to make the steel glow\u2014then I could love her.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Presently I discovered that she knew I was watching her, for she stirred\r\n      not, she lifted not her crafty eyelid; she had glanced down from her\r\n      netting to her small foot, peeping from the soft folds of her purple\r\n      merino gown; thence her eye reverted to her hand, ivory white, with a\r\n      bright garnet ring on the forefinger, and a light frill of lace round the\r\n      wrist; with a scarcely perceptible movement she turned her head, causing\r\n      her nut-brown curls to wave gracefully. In these slight signs I read that\r\n      the wish of her heart, the design of her brain, was to lure back the game\r\n      she had scared. A little incident gave her the opportunity of addressing\r\n      me again.\r\n    \n\r\n      While all was silence in the class\u2014silence, but for the rustling of\r\n      copy-books and the travelling of pens over their pages\u2014a leaf of the\r\n      large folding-door, opening from the hall, unclosed, admitting a pupil\r\n      who, after making a hasty obeisance, ensconced herself with some\r\n      appearance of trepidation, probably occasioned by her entering so late, in\r\n      a vacant seat at the desk nearest the door. Being seated, she proceeded,\r\n      still with an air of hurry and embarrassment, to open her cabas, to take\r\n      out her books; and, while I was waiting for her to look up, in order to\r\n      make out her identity\u2014for, shortsighted as I was, I had not\r\n      recognized her at her entrance\u2014Mdlle. Reuter, leaving her chair,\r\n      approached the estrade.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Creemsvort,\u201d said she, in a whisper: for when the schoolrooms\r\n      were silent, the directress always moved with velvet tread, and spoke in\r\n      the most subdued key, enforcing order and stillness fully as much by\r\n      example as precept: \u201cMonsieur Creemsvort, that young person, who has just\r\n      entered, wishes to have the advantage of taking lessons with you in\r\n      English; she is not a pupil of the house; she is, indeed, in one sense, a\r\n      teacher, for she gives instruction in lace-mending, and in little\r\n      varieties of ornamental needle-work. She very properly proposes to qualify\r\n      herself for a higher department of education, and has asked permission to\r\n      attend your lessons, in order to perfect her knowledge of English, in\r\n      which language she has, I believe, already made some progress; of course\r\n      it is my wish to aid her in an effort so praiseworthy; you will permit her\r\n      then to benefit by your instruction\u2014n\u2019est ce pas, monsieur?\u201d And\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s eyes were raised to mine with a look at once naive,\r\n      benign, and beseeching.\r\n    \n\r\n      I replied, \u201cOf course,\u201d very laconically, almost abruptly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnother word,\u201d she said, with softness: \u201cMdlle. Henri has not received a\r\n      regular education; perhaps her natural talents are not of the highest\r\n      order: but I can assure you of the excellence of her intentions, and even\r\n      of the amiability of her disposition. Monsieur will then, I am sure, have\r\n      the goodness to be considerate with her at first, and not expose her\r\n      backwardness, her inevitable deficiencies, before the young ladies, who,\r\n      in a sense, are her pupils. Will Monsieur Creemsvort favour me by\r\n      attending to this hint?\u201d I nodded. She continued with subdued earnestness\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPardon me, monsieur, if I venture to add that what I have just said is of\r\n      importance to the poor girl; she already experiences great difficulty in\r\n      impressing these giddy young things with a due degree of deference for her\r\n      authority, and should that difficulty be increased by new discoveries of\r\n      her incapacity, she might find her position in my establishment too\r\n      painful to be retained; a circumstance I should much regret for her sake,\r\n      as she can ill afford to lose the profits of her occupation here.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter possessed marvellous tact; but tact the most exclusive,\r\n      unsupported by sincerity, will sometimes fail of its effect; thus, on this\r\n      occasion, the longer she preached about the necessity of being indulgent\r\n      to the governess pupil, the more impatient I felt as I listened. I\r\n      discerned so clearly that while her professed motive was a wish to aid the\r\n      dull, though well-meaning Mdlle. Henri, her real one was no other than a\r\n      design to impress me with an idea of her own exalted goodness and tender\r\n      considerateness; so having again hastily nodded assent to her remarks, I\r\n      obviated their renewal by suddenly demanding the compositions, in a sharp\r\n      accent, and stepping from the estrade, I proceeded to collect them. As I\r\n      passed the governess-pupil, I said to her\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have come in too late to receive a lesson to-day; try to be more\r\n      punctual next time.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I was behind her, and could not read in her face the effect of my not very\r\n      civil speech. Probably I should not have troubled myself to do so, had I\r\n      been full in front; but I observed that she immediately began to slip her\r\n      books into her cabas again; and, presently, after I had returned to the\r\n      estrade, while I was arranging the mass of compositions, I heard the\r\n      folding-door again open and close; and, on looking up, I perceived her\r\n      place vacant. I thought to myself, \u201cShe will consider her first attempt at\r\n      taking a lesson in English something of a failure;\u201d and I wondered whether\r\n      she had departed in the sulks, or whether stupidity had induced her to\r\n      take my words too literally, or, finally, whether my irritable tone had\r\n      wounded her feelings. The last notion I dismissed almost as soon as I had\r\n      conceived it, for not having seen any appearance of sensitiveness in any\r\n      human face since my arrival in Belgium, I had begun to regard it almost as\r\n      a fabulous quality. Whether her physiognomy announced it I could not tell,\r\n      for her speedy exit had allowed me no time to ascertain the circumstance.\r\n      I had, indeed, on two or three previous occasions, caught a passing view\r\n      of her (as I believe has been mentioned before); but I had never stopped\r\n      to scrutinize either her face or person, and had but the most vague idea\r\n      of her general appearance. Just as I had finished rolling up the\r\n      compositions, the four o\u2019clock bell rang; with my accustomed alertness in\r\n      obeying that signal, I grasped my hat and evacuated the premises.\r\n    \n"}
{"14": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIV.\r\n    \n\r\n      IF I was punctual in quitting Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s domicile, I was at least\r\n      equally punctual in arriving there; I came the next day at five minutes\r\n      before two, and on reaching the schoolroom door, before I opened it, I\r\n      heard a rapid, gabbling sound, which warned me that the \u201cpri\u00e8re du midi\u201d\r\n      was not yet concluded. I waited the termination thereof; it would have\r\n      been impious to intrude my heretical presence during its progress. How the\r\n      repeater of the prayer did cackle and splutter! I never before or since\r\n      heard language enounced with such steam-engine haste. \u201cNotre P\u00e8re qui \u00eates\r\n      au ciel\u201d went off like a shot; then followed an address to Marie \u201cvi\u00e8rge\r\n      c\u00e9leste, reine des anges, maison d\u2019or, tour d\u2019ivoire!\u201d and then an\r\n      invocation to the saint of the day; and then down they all sat, and the\r\n      solemn (?) rite was over; and I entered, flinging the door wide and\r\n      striding in fast, as it was my wont to do now; for I had found that in\r\n      entering with aplomb, and mounting the estrade with emphasis, consisted\r\n      the grand secret of ensuring immediate silence. The folding-doors between\r\n      the two classes, opened for the prayer, were instantly closed; a\r\n      ma\u00eetresse, work-box in hand, took her seat at her appropriate desk; the\r\n      pupils sat still with their pens and books before them; my three beauties\r\n      in the van, now well humbled by a demeanour of consistent coolness, sat\r\n      erect with their hands folded quietly on their knees; they had given up\r\n      giggling and whispering to each other, and no longer ventured to utter\r\n      pert speeches in my presence; they now only talked to me occasionally with\r\n      their eyes, by means of which organs they could still, however, say very\r\n      audacious and coquettish things. Had affection, goodness, modesty, real\r\n      talent, ever employed those bright orbs as interpreters, I do not think I\r\n      could have refrained from giving a kind and encouraging, perhaps an ardent\r\n      reply now and then; but as it was, I found pleasure in answering the\r\n      glance of vanity with the gaze of stoicism. Youthful, fair, brilliant, as\r\n      were many of my pupils, I can truly say that in me they never saw any\r\n      other bearing than such as an austere, though just guardian, might have\r\n      observed towards them. If any doubt the accuracy of this assertion, as\r\n      inferring more conscientious self-denial or Scipio-like self-control than\r\n      they feel disposed to give me credit for, let them take into consideration\r\n      the following circumstances, which, while detracting from my merit,\r\n      justify my veracity.\r\n    \n\r\n      Know, O incredulous reader! that a master stands in a somewhat different\r\n      relation towards a pretty, light-headed, probably ignorant girl, to that\r\n      occupied by a partner at a ball, or a gallant on the promenade. A\r\n      professor does not meet his pupil to see her dressed in satin and muslin,\r\n      with hair perfumed and curled, neck scarcely shaded by aerial lace, round\r\n      white arms circled with bracelets, feet dressed for the gliding dance. It\r\n      is not his business to whirl her through the waltz, to feed her with\r\n      compliments, to heighten her beauty by the flush of gratified vanity.\r\n      Neither does he encounter her on the smooth-rolled, tree shaded Boulevard,\r\n      in the green and sunny park, whither she repairs clad in her becoming\r\n      walking dress, her scarf thrown with grace over her shoulders, her little\r\n      bonnet scarcely screening her curls, the red rose under its brim adding a\r\n      new tint to the softer rose on her cheek; her face and eyes, too,\r\n      illumined with smiles, perhaps as transient as the sunshine of the\r\n      gala-day, but also quite as brilliant; it is not his office to walk by her\r\n      side, to listen to her lively chat, to carry her parasol, scarcely larger\r\n      than a broad green leaf, to lead in a ribbon her Blenheim spaniel or\r\n      Italian greyhound. No: he finds her in the schoolroom, plainly dressed,\r\n      with books before her. Owing to her education or her nature books are to\r\n      her a nuisance, and she opens them with aversion, yet her teacher must\r\n      instil into her mind the contents of these books; that mind resists the\r\n      admission of grave information, it recoils, it grows restive, sullen\r\n      tempers are shown, disfiguring frowns spoil the symmetry of the face,\r\n      sometimes coarse gestures banish grace from the deportment, while muttered\r\n      expressions, redolent of native and ineradicable vulgarity, desecrate the\r\n      sweetness of the voice. Where the temperament is serene though the\r\n      intellect be sluggish, an unconquerable dullness opposes every effort to\r\n      instruct. Where there is cunning but not energy, dissimulation, falsehood,\r\n      a thousand schemes and tricks are put in play to evade the necessity of\r\n      application; in short, to the tutor, female youth, female charms are like\r\n      tapestry hangings, of which the wrong side is continually turned towards\r\n      him; and even when he sees the smooth, neat external surface he so well\r\n      knows what knots, long stitches, and jagged ends are behind that he has\r\n      scarce a temptation to admire too fondly the seemly forms and bright\r\n      colours exposed to general view.\r\n    \n\r\n      Our likings are regulated by our circumstances. The artist prefers a hilly\r\n      country because it is picturesque; the engineer a flat one because it is\r\n      convenient; the man of pleasure likes what he calls \u201ca fine woman\u201d\u2014she\r\n      suits him; the fashionable young gentleman admires the fashionable young\r\n      lady\u2014she is of his kind; the toil-worn, fagged, probably irritable\r\n      tutor, blind almost to beauty, insensible to airs and graces, glories\r\n      chiefly in certain mental qualities: application, love of knowledge,\r\n      natural capacity, docility, truthfulness, gratefulness, are the charms\r\n      that attract his notice and win his regard. These he seeks, but seldom\r\n      meets; these, if by chance he finds, he would fain retain for ever, and\r\n      when separation deprives him of them he feels as if some ruthless hand had\r\n      snatched from him his only ewe-lamb. Such being the case, and the case it\r\n      is, my readers will agree with me that there was nothing either very\r\n      meritorious or very marvellous in the integrity and moderation of my\r\n      conduct at Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s pensionnat de demoiselles.\r\n    \n\r\n      My first business this afternoon consisted in reading the list of places\r\n      for the month, determined by the relative correctness of the compositions\r\n      given the preceding day. The list was headed, as usual, by the name of\r\n      Sylvie, that plain, quiet little girl I have described before as being at\r\n      once the best and ugliest pupil in the establishment; the second place had\r\n      fallen to the lot of a certain L\u00e9onie Ledru, a diminutive, sharp-featured,\r\n      and parchment-skinned creature of quick wits, frail conscience, and\r\n      indurated feelings; a lawyer-like thing, of whom I used to say that, had\r\n      she been a boy, she would have made a model of an unprincipled, clever\r\n      attorney. Then came Eulalie, the proud beauty, the Juno of the school,\r\n      whom six long years of drilling in the simple grammar of the English\r\n      language had compelled, despite the stiff phlegm of her intellect, to\r\n      acquire a mechanical acquaintance with most of its rules. No smile, no\r\n      trace of pleasure or satisfaction appeared in Sylvie\u2019s nun-like and\r\n      passive face as she heard her name read first. I always felt saddened by\r\n      the sight of that poor girl\u2019s absolute quiescence on all occasions, and it\r\n      was my custom to look at her, to address her, as seldom as possible; her\r\n      extreme docility, her assiduous perseverance, would have recommended her\r\n      warmly to my good opinion; her modesty, her intelligence, would have\r\n      induced me to feel most kindly\u2014most affectionately towards her,\r\n      notwithstanding the almost ghastly plainness of her features, the\r\n      disproportion of her form, the corpse-like lack of animation in her\r\n      countenance, had I not been aware that every friendly word, every kindly\r\n      action, would be reported by her to her confessor, and by him\r\n      misinterpreted and poisoned. Once I laid my hand on her head, in token of\r\n      approbation; I thought Sylvie was going to smile, her dim eye almost\r\n      kindled; but, presently, she shrank from me; I was a man and a heretic;\r\n      she, poor child! a destined nun and devoted Catholic: thus a four-fold\r\n      wall of separation divided her mind from mine. A pert smirk, and a hard\r\n      glance of triumph, was L\u00e9onie\u2019s method of testifying her gratification;\r\n      Eulalie looked sullen and envious\u2014she had hoped to be first.\r\n      Hortense and Caroline exchanged a reckless grimace on hearing their names\r\n      read out somewhere near the bottom of the list; the brand of mental\r\n      inferiority was considered by them as no disgrace, their hopes for the\r\n      future being based solely on their personal attractions.\r\n    \n\r\n      This affair arranged, the regular lesson followed. During a brief\r\n      interval, employed by the pupils in ruling their books, my eye, ranging\r\n      carelessly over the benches, observed, for the first time, that the\r\n      farthest seat in the farthest row\u2014a seat usually vacant\u2014was\r\n      again filled by the new scholar, the Mdlle. Henri so ostentatiously\r\n      recommended to me by the directress. To-day I had on my spectacles; her\r\n      appearance, therefore, was clear to me at the first glance; I had not to\r\n      puzzle over it. She looked young; yet, had I been required to name her\r\n      exact age, I should have been somewhat nonplussed; the slightness of her\r\n      figure might have suited seventeen; a certain anxious and pre-occupied\r\n      expression of face seemed the indication of riper years. She was dressed,\r\n      like all the rest, in a dark stuff gown and a white collar; her features\r\n      were dissimilar to any there, not so rounded, more defined, yet scarcely\r\n      regular. The shape of her head too was different, the superior part more\r\n      developed, the base considerably less. I felt assured, at first sight,\r\n      that she was not a Belgian; her complexion, her countenance, her\r\n      lineaments, her figure, were all distinct from theirs, and, evidently, the\r\n      type of another race\u2014of a race less gifted with fullness of flesh\r\n      and plenitude of blood; less jocund, material, unthinking. When I first\r\n      cast my eyes on her, she sat looking fixedly down, her chin resting on her\r\n      hand, and she did not change her attitude till I commenced the lesson.\r\n      None of the Belgian girls would have retained one position, and that a\r\n      reflective one, for the same length of time. Yet, having intimated that\r\n      her appearance was peculiar, as being unlike that of her Flemish\r\n      companions, I have little more to say respecting it; I can pronounce no\r\n      encomiums on her beauty, for she was not beautiful; nor offer condolence\r\n      on her plainness, for neither was she plain; a careworn character of\r\n      forehead, and a corresponding moulding of the mouth, struck me with a\r\n      sentiment resembling surprise, but these traits would probably have passed\r\n      unnoticed by any less crotchety observer.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now, reader, though I have spent more than a page in describing Mdlle.\r\n      Henri, I know well enough that I have left on your mind\u2019s eye no distinct\r\n      picture of her; I have not painted her complexion, nor her eyes, nor her\r\n      hair, nor even drawn the outline of her shape. You cannot tell whether her\r\n      nose was aquiline or retrouss\u00e9, whether her chin was long or short, her\r\n      face square or oval; nor could I the first day, and it is not my intention\r\n      to communicate to you at once a knowledge I myself gained by little and\r\n      little.\r\n    \n\r\n      I gave a short exercise which they all wrote down. I saw the new pupil\r\n      was puzzled at first with the novelty of the form and language; once or\r\n      twice she looked at me with a sort of painful solicitude, as not\r\n      comprehending at all what I meant; then she was not ready when the others\r\n      were, she could not write her phrases so fast as they did; I would not\r\n      help her, I went on relentless. She looked at me; her eye said most\r\n      plainly, \u201cI cannot follow you.\u201d I disregarded the appeal, and, carelessly\r\n      leaning back in my chair, glancing from time to time with a\r\n      nonchalant air\r\n      out of the window, I dictated a little faster. On looking towards her\r\n      again, I perceived her face clouded with embarrassment, but she was still\r\n      writing on most diligently; I paused a few seconds; she employed the\r\n      interval in hurriedly re-perusing what she had written, and shame and\r\n      discomfiture were apparent in her countenance; she evidently found she had\r\n      made great nonsense of it. In ten minutes more the dictation was complete,\r\n      and, having allowed a brief space in which to correct it, I took their\r\n      books; it was with a reluctant hand Mdlle. Henri gave up hers, but, having\r\n      once yielded it to my possession, she composed her anxious face, as if,\r\n      for the present she had resolved to dismiss regret, and had made up her\r\n      mind to be thought unprecedentedly stupid. Glancing over her exercise, I\r\n      found that several lines had been omitted, but what was written contained\r\n      very few faults; I instantly inscribed \u201cBon\u201d at the bottom of the page,\r\n      and returned it to her; she smiled, at first incredulously, then as if\r\n      reassured, but did not lift her eyes; she could look at me, it seemed,\r\n      when perplexed and bewildered, but not when gratified; I thought that\r\n      scarcely fair.\r\n    \n"}
{"15": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XV.\r\n    \n\r\n      SOME time elapsed before I again gave a lesson in the first class; the\r\n      holiday of Whitsuntide occupied three days, and on the fourth it was the\r\n      turn of the second division to receive my instructions. As I made the\r\n      transit of the carr\u00e9, I observed, as usual, the band of\r\n      sewers surrounding\r\n      Mdlle. Henri; there were only about a dozen of them, but they made as much\r\n      noise as might have sufficed for fifty; they seemed very little under her\r\n      control; three or four at once assailed her with importunate requirements;\r\n      she looked harassed, she demanded silence, but in vain. She saw me, and I\r\n      read in her eye pain that a stranger should witness the insubordination of\r\n      her pupils; she seemed to entreat order\u2014her prayers were useless;\r\n      then I remarked that she compressed her lips and contracted her brow; and\r\n      her countenance, if I read it correctly, said\u2014\u201cI have done my best;\r\n      I seem to merit blame notwithstanding; blame me then who will.\u201d I passed\r\n      on; as I closed the school-room door, I heard her say, suddenly and\r\n      sharply, addressing one of the eldest and most turbulent of the lot\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAm\u00e9lie Mullenberg, ask me no question, and request of me no assistance,\r\n      for a week to come; during that space of time I will neither speak to you\r\n      nor help you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The words were uttered with emphasis\u2014nay, with vehemence\u2014and a\r\n      comparative silence followed; whether the calm was permanent, I know not;\r\n      two doors now closed between me and the carr\u00e9.\r\n    \n\r\n      Next day was appropriated to the first class; on my arrival, I found the\r\n      directress seated, as usual, in a chair between the two estrades, and\r\n      before her was standing Mdlle. Henri, in an attitude (as it seemed to me)\r\n      of somewhat reluctant attention. The directress was knitting and talking\r\n      at the same time. Amidst the hum of a large school-room, it was easy so to\r\n      speak in the ear of one person, as to be heard by that person alone, and\r\n      it was thus Mdlle. Reuter parleyed with her teacher. The face of the\r\n      latter was a little flushed, not a little troubled; there was vexation in\r\n      it, whence resulting I know not, for the directress looked very placid\r\n      indeed; she could not be scolding in such gentle whispers, and with so\r\n      equable a mien; no, it was presently proved that her discourse had been of\r\n      the most friendly tendency, for I heard the closing words\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est assez, ma bonne amie; \u00e0 present je ne veux pas vous retenir\r\n      davantage.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Without reply, Mdlle. Henri turned away; dissatisfaction was plainly\r\n      evinced in her face, and a smile, slight and brief, but bitter,\r\n      distrustful, and, I thought, scornful, curled her lip as she took her\r\n      place in the class; it was a secret, involuntary smile, which lasted but a\r\n      second; an air of depression succeeded, chased away presently by one of\r\n      attention and interest, when I gave the word for all the pupils to take\r\n      their reading-books. In general I hated the reading-lesson, it was such a\r\n      torture to the ear to listen to their uncouth mouthing of my native\r\n      tongue, and no effort of example or precept on my part ever seemed to\r\n      effect the slightest improvement in their accent. To-day, each in her\r\n      appropriate key, lisped, stuttered, mumbled, and jabbered as usual; about\r\n      fifteen had racked me in turn, and my auricular nerve was expecting with\r\n      resignation the discords of the sixteenth, when a full, though low voice,\r\n      read out, in clear correct English.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOn his way to Perth, the king was met by a Highland woman, calling\r\n      herself a prophetess; she stood at the side of the ferry by which he was\r\n      about to travel to the north, and cried with a loud voice, \u2018My lord the\r\n      king, if you pass this water you will never return again alive!\u2019\u201d\r\n      (Vide the history of Scotland.)\r\n    \n\r\n      I looked up in amazement; the voice was a voice of Albion; the accent was\r\n      pure and silvery; it only wanted firmness, and assurance, to be the\r\n      counterpart of what any well-educated lady in Essex or Middlesex might\r\n      have enounced, yet the speaker or reader was no other than Mdlle. Henri,\r\n      in whose grave, joyless face I saw no mark of consciousness that she had\r\n      performed any extraordinary feat. No one else evinced surprise either.\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter knitted away assiduously; I was aware, however, that at the\r\n      conclusion of the paragraph, she had lifted her eyelid and honoured me\r\n      with a glance sideways; she did not know the full excellency of the\r\n      teacher\u2019s style of reading, but she perceived that her accent was not that\r\n      of the others, and wanted to discover what I thought; I masked my visage\r\n      with indifference, and ordered the next girl to proceed.\r\n    \n\r\n      When the lesson was over, I took advantage of the confusion caused by\r\n      breaking up, to approach Mdlle. Henri; she was standing near the window\r\n      and retired as I advanced; she thought I wanted to look out, and did not\r\n      imagine that I could have anything to say to her. I took her\r\n      exercise-book out of her hand; as I turned over the leaves I addressed\r\n      her:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have had lessons in English before?\u201d I asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo! you read it well; you have been in England?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, no!\u201d with some animation.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have been in English families?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Still the answer was \u201cNo.\u201d Here my eye, resting on the flyleaf of the\r\n      book, saw written, \u201cFrances Evan Henri.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour name?\u201d I asked\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      My interrogations were cut short; I heard a little rustling behind me, and\r\n      close at my back was the directress, professing to be examining the\r\n      interior of a desk.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said she, looking up and addressing the teacher, \u201cWill you\r\n      have the goodness to go and stand in the corridor, while the young ladies\r\n      are putting on their things, and try to keep some order?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mdlle. Henri obeyed.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat splendid weather!\u201d observed the directress cheerfully, glancing at\r\n      the same time from the window. I assented and was withdrawing. \u201cWhat of\r\n      your new pupil, monsieur?\u201d continued she, following my retreating steps.\r\n      \u201cIs she likely to make progress in English?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndeed I can hardly judge. She possesses a pretty good accent; of her\r\n      real knowledge of the language I have as yet had no opportunity of forming\r\n      an opinion.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd her natural capacity, monsieur? I have had my fears about that: can\r\n      you relieve me by an assurance at least of its average power?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI see no reason to doubt its average power, mademoiselle, but really I\r\n      scarcely know her, and have not had time to study the calibre of her\r\n      capacity. I wish you a very good afternoon.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She still pursued me. \u201cYou will observe, monsieur, and tell me what you\r\n      think; I could so much better rely on your opinion than on my own; women\r\n      cannot judge of these things as men can, and, excuse my pertinacity,\r\n      monsieur, but it is natural I should feel interested about this poor\r\n      little girl (pauvre petite); she has scarcely any relations, her own\r\n      efforts are all she has to look to, her acquirements must be her sole\r\n      fortune; her present position has once been mine, or nearly so; it is then\r\n      but natural I should sympathize with her; and sometimes when I see the\r\n      difficulty she has in managing pupils, I feel quite chagrined. I doubt not\r\n      she does her best, her intentions are excellent; but, monsieur, she wants\r\n      tact and firmness. I have talked to her on the subject, but I am not\r\n      fluent, and probably did not express myself with clearness; she never\r\n      appears to comprehend me. Now, would you occasionally, when you see an\r\n      opportunity, slip in a word of advice to her on the subject; men have so\r\n      much more influence than women have\u2014they argue so much more\r\n      logically than we do; and you, monsieur, in particular, have so paramount\r\n      a power of making yourself obeyed; a word of advice from you could not but\r\n      do her good; even if she were sullen and headstrong (which I hope she is\r\n      not), she would scarcely refuse to listen to you; for my own part, I can\r\n      truly say that I never attend one of your lessons without deriving benefit\r\n      from witnessing your management of the pupils. The other masters are a\r\n      constant source of anxiety to me; they cannot impress the young ladies\r\n      with sentiments of respect, nor restrain the levity natural to youth: in\r\n      you, monsieur, I feel the most absolute confidence; try then to put this\r\n      poor child into the way of controlling our giddy, high-spirited\r\n      Brabantoises. But, monsieur, I would add one word more; don\u2019t alarm her\r\n      amour propre; beware of inflicting a wound there. I\r\n      reluctantly admit that in that particular she is blameably\u2014some would say\r\n      ridiculously\u2014susceptible. I fear I have touched this sore point\r\n      inadvertently, and she cannot get over it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      During the greater part of this harangue my hand was on the lock of the\r\n      outer door; I now turned it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAu revoir, mademoiselle,\u201d said I, and I escaped. I saw the directress\u2019s\r\n      stock of words was yet far from exhausted. She looked after me, she would\r\n      fain have detained me longer. Her manner towards me had been altered ever\r\n      since I had begun to treat her with hardness and indifference: she almost\r\n      cringed to me on every occasion; she consulted my countenance incessantly,\r\n      and beset me with innumerable little officious attentions. Servility\r\n      creates despotism. This slavish homage, instead of softening my heart,\r\n      only pampered whatever was stern and exacting in its mood. The very\r\n      circumstance of her hovering round me like a fascinated bird, seemed to\r\n      transform me into a rigid pillar of stone; her flatteries irritated my\r\n      scorn, her blandishments confirmed my reserve. At times I wondered what\r\n      she meant by giving herself such trouble to win me, when the more\r\n      profitable Pelet was already in her nets, and when, too, she was aware\r\n      that I possessed her secret, for I had not scrupled to tell her as much:\r\n      but the fact is that as it was her nature to doubt the reality and\r\n      under-value the worth of modesty, affection, disinterestedness\u2014to\r\n      regard these qualities as foibles of character\u2014so it was equally her\r\n      tendency to consider pride, hardness, selfishness, as proofs of strength.\r\n      She would trample on the neck of humility, she would kneel at the feet of\r\n      disdain; she would meet tenderness with secret contempt, indifference she\r\n      would woo with ceaseless assiduities. Benevolence, devotedness,\r\n      enthusiasm, were her antipathies; for dissimulation and self-interest she\r\n      had a preference\u2014they were real wisdom in her eyes; moral and\r\n      physical degradation, mental and bodily inferiority, she regarded with\r\n      indulgence; they were foils capable of being turned to good account as\r\n      set-offs for her own endowments. To violence, injustice, tyranny, she\r\n      succumbed\u2014they were her natural masters; she had no propensity to\r\n      hate, no impulse to resist them; the indignation their behests awake in\r\n      some hearts was unknown in hers. From all this it resulted that the false\r\n      and selfish called her wise, the vulgar and debased termed her charitable,\r\n      the insolent and unjust dubbed her amiable, the conscientious and\r\n      benevolent generally at first accepted as valid her claim to be considered\r\n      one of themselves; but ere long the plating of pretension wore off, the\r\n      real material appeared below, and they laid her aside as a deception.\r\n    \n"}
{"16": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVI.\r\n    \n\r\n      In the course of another fortnight I had seen sufficient of Frances Evans\r\n      Henri, to enable me to form a more definite opinion of her character. I\r\n      found her possessed in a somewhat remarkable degree of at least two good\r\n      points, viz., perseverance and a sense of duty; I found she was really\r\n      capable of applying to study, of contending with difficulties. At first I\r\n      offered her the same help which I had always found it necessary to confer\r\n      on the others; I began with unloosing for her each knotty point, but I\r\n      soon discovered that such help was regarded by my new pupil as degrading;\r\n      she recoiled from it with a certain proud impatience. Hereupon I appointed\r\n      her long lessons, and left her to solve alone any perplexities they might\r\n      present. She set to the task with serious ardour, and having quickly\r\n      accomplished one labour, eagerly demanded more. So much for her\r\n      perseverance; as to her sense of duty, it evinced itself thus: she liked\r\n      to learn, but hated to teach; her progress as a pupil depended upon\r\n      herself, and I saw that on herself she could calculate with certainty; her\r\n      success as a teacher rested partly, perhaps chiefly, upon the will of\r\n      others; it cost her a most painful effort to enter into conflict with this\r\n      foreign will, to endeavour to bend it into subjection to her own; for in\r\n      what regarded people in general the action of her will was impeded by many\r\n      scruples; it was as unembarrassed as strong where her own affairs were\r\n      concerned, and to it she could at any time subject her inclination, if\r\n      that inclination went counter to her convictions of right; yet when called\r\n      upon to wrestle with the propensities, the habits, the faults of others,\r\n      of children especially, who are deaf to reason, and, for the most part,\r\n      insensate to persuasion, her will sometimes almost refused to act; then\r\n      came in the sense of duty, and forced the reluctant will into operation. A\r\n      wasteful expense of energy and labour was frequently the consequence;\r\n      Frances toiled for and with her pupils like a drudge, but it was long ere\r\n      her conscientious exertions were rewarded by anything like docility on\r\n      their part, because they saw that they had power over her, inasmuch as by\r\n      resisting her painful attempts to convince, persuade, control\u2014by\r\n      forcing her to the employment of coercive measures\u2014they could\r\n      inflict upon her exquisite suffering. Human beings\u2014human children\r\n      especially\u2014seldom deny themselves the pleasure of exercising a power\r\n      which they are conscious of possessing, even though that power consist\r\n      only in a capacity to make others wretched; a pupil whose sensations are\r\n      duller than those of his instructor, while his nerves are tougher and his\r\n      bodily strength perhaps greater, has an immense advantage over that\r\n      instructor, and he will generally use it relentlessly, because the very\r\n      young, very healthy, very thoughtless, know neither how to sympathize nor\r\n      how to spare. Frances, I fear, suffered much; a continual weight seemed to\r\n      oppress her spirits; I have said she did not live in the house, and\r\n      whether in her own abode, wherever that might be, she wore the same\r\n      preoccupied, unsmiling, sorrowfully resolved air that always shaded her\r\n      features under the roof of Mdlle. Reuter, I could not tell.\r\n    \n\r\n      One day I gave, as a devoir, the trite little anecdote of Alfred tending\r\n      cakes in the herdsman\u2019s hut, to be related with amplifications. A singular\r\n      affair most of the pupils made of it; brevity was what they had chiefly\r\n      studied; the majority of the narratives were perfectly unintelligible;\r\n      those of Sylvie and L\u00e9onie Ledru alone pretended to anything like sense\r\n      and connection. Eulalie, indeed, had hit, upon a clever expedient for at\r\n      once ensuring accuracy and saving trouble; she had obtained access somehow\r\n      to an abridged history of England, and had copied the anecdote out fair. I\r\n      wrote on the margin of her production \u201cStupid and deceitful,\u201d and then\r\n      tore it down the middle.\r\n    \n\r\n      Last in the pile of single-leaved devoirs, I found one of several sheets,\r\n      neatly written out and stitched together; I knew the hand, and scarcely\r\n      needed the evidence of the signature \u201cFrances Evans Henri\u201d to confirm my\r\n      conjecture as to the writer\u2019s identity.\r\n    \n\r\n      Night was my usual time for correcting devoirs, and my own room the usual\r\n      scene of such task\u2014task most onerous hitherto; and it seemed strange\r\n      to me to feel rising within me an incipient sense of interest, as I\r\n      snuffed the candle and addressed myself to the perusal of the poor\r\n      teacher\u2019s manuscript.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNow,\u201d thought I, \u201cI shall see a glimpse of what she really is; I shall\r\n      get an idea of the nature and extent of her powers; not that she can be\r\n      expected to express herself well in a foreign tongue, but still, if she\r\n      has any mind, here will be a reflection of it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The narrative commenced by a description of a Saxon peasant\u2019s hut,\r\n      situated within the confines of a great, leafless, winter forest; it\r\n      represented an evening in December; flakes of snow were falling, and the\r\n      herdsman foretold a heavy storm; he summoned his wife to aid him in\r\n      collecting their flock, roaming far away on the pastoral banks of the\r\n      Thone; he warns her that it will be late ere they return. The good woman\r\n      is reluctant to quit her occupation of baking cakes for the evening meal;\r\n      but acknowledging the primary importance of securing the herds and flocks,\r\n      she puts on her sheep-skin mantle; and, addressing a stranger who rests\r\n      half reclined on a bed of rushes near the hearth, bids him mind the bread\r\n      till her return.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cTake care, young man,\u201d she continues, \u201cthat you fasten the door well\r\n      after us; and, above all, open to none in our absence; whatever sound you\r\n      hear, stir not, and look not out. The night will soon fall; this forest is\r\n      most wild and lonely; strange noises are often heard therein after sunset;\r\n      wolves haunt these glades, and Danish warriors infest the country; worse\r\n      things are talked of; you might chance to hear, as it were, a child cry,\r\n      and on opening the door to afford it succour, a great black bull, or a\r\n      shadowy goblin dog, might rush over the threshold; or, more awful still,\r\n      if something flapped, as with wings, against the lattice, and then a raven\r\n      or a white dove flew in and settled on the hearth, such a visitor would be\r\n      a sure sign of misfortune to the house; therefore, heed my advice, and\r\n      lift the latchet for nothing.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Her husband calls her away, both depart. The stranger, left alone, listens\r\n      awhile to the muffled snow-wind, the remote, swollen sound of the river,\r\n      and then he speaks.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is Christmas Eve,\u201d says he, \u201cI mark the date; here I sit alone on a\r\n      rude couch of rushes, sheltered by the thatch of a herdsman\u2019s hut; I,\r\n      whose inheritance was a kingdom, owe my night\u2019s harbourage to a poor serf;\r\n      my throne is usurped, my crown presses the brow of an invader; I have no\r\n      friends; my troops wander broken in the hills of Wales; reckless robbers\r\n      spoil my country; my subjects lie prostrate, their breasts crushed by the\r\n      heel of the brutal Dane. Fate! thou hast done thy worst, and now thou\r\n      standest before me resting thy hand on thy blunted blade. Ay; I see thine\r\n      eye confront mine and demand why I still live, why I still hope. Pagan\r\n      demon, I credit not thine omnipotence, and so cannot succumb to thy power.\r\n      My God, whose Son, as on this night, took on Him the form of man, and for\r\n      man vouchsafed to suffer and bleed, controls thy hand, and without His\r\n      behest thou canst not strike a stroke. My God is sinless, eternal,\r\n      all-wise\u2014in Him is my trust; and though stripped and crushed by\r\n      thee\u2014though naked, desolate, void of resource\u2014I do not despair, I cannot\r\n      despair: were the lance of Guthrum now wet with my blood, I should not\r\n      despair. I watch, I toil, I hope, I pray; Jehovah, in his own time, will\r\n      aid.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I need not continue the quotation; the whole devoir was in the same\r\n      strain. There were errors of orthography, there were foreign idioms, there\r\n      were some faults of construction, there were verbs irregular transformed\r\n      into verbs regular; it was mostly made up, as the above example shows, of\r\n      short and somewhat rude sentences, and the style stood in great need of\r\n      polish and sustained dignity; yet such as it was, I had hitherto seen\r\n      nothing like it in the course of my professorial experience. The girl\u2019s\r\n      mind had conceived a picture of the hut, of the two peasants, of the\r\n      crownless king; she had imagined the wintry forest, she had recalled the\r\n      old Saxon ghost-legends, she had appreciated Alfred\u2019s courage under\r\n      calamity, she had remembered his Christian education, and had shown him,\r\n      with the rooted confidence of those primitive days, relying on the\r\n      scriptural Jehovah for aid against the mythological Destiny. This she had\r\n      done without a hint from me: I had given the subject, but not said a word\r\n      about the manner of treating it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI will find, or make, an opportunity of speaking to her,\u201d I said to\r\n      myself as I rolled the devoir up; \u201cI will learn what she has of English in\r\n      her besides the name of Frances Evans; she is no novice in the language,\r\n      that is evident, yet she told me she had neither been in England, nor\r\n      taken lessons in English, nor lived in English families.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      In the course of my next lesson, I made a report of the other devoirs,\r\n      dealing out praise and blame in very small retail parcels, according to my\r\n      custom, for there was no use in blaming severely, and high encomiums were\r\n      rarely merited. I said nothing of Mdlle. Henri\u2019s exercise, and, spectacles\r\n      on nose, I endeavoured to decipher in her countenance her sentiments at\r\n      the omission. I wanted to find out whether in her existed a consciousness\r\n      of her own talents. \u201cIf she thinks she did a clever thing in composing\r\n      that devoir, she will now look mortified,\u201d thought I. Grave as usual,\r\n      almost sombre, was her face; as usual, her eyes were fastened on the\r\n      cahier open before her; there was something, I thought, of expectation in\r\n      her attitude, as I concluded a brief review of the last devoir, and when,\r\n      casting it from me and rubbing my hands, I bade them take their grammars,\r\n      some slight change did pass over her air and mien, as though she now\r\n      relinquished a faint prospect of pleasant excitement; she had been waiting\r\n      for something to be discussed in which she had a degree of interest; the\r\n      discussion was not to come on, so expectation sank back, shrunk and sad,\r\n      but attention, promptly filling up the void, repaired in a moment the\r\n      transient collapse of feature; still, I felt, rather than saw, during the\r\n      whole course of the lesson, that a hope had been wrenched from her, and\r\n      that if she did not show distress, it was because she would not.\r\n    \n\r\n      At four o\u2019clock, when the bell rang and the room was in immediate tumult,\r\n      instead of taking my hat and starting from the estrade, I sat still a\r\n      moment. I looked at Frances, she was putting her books into her cabas;\r\n      having fastened the button, she raised her head; encountering my eye, she\r\n      made a quiet, respectful obeisance, as bidding good afternoon, and was\r\n      turning to depart:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCome here,\u201d said I, lifting my finger at the same time. She hesitated;\r\n      she could not hear the words amidst the uproar now pervading both\r\n      school-rooms; I repeated the sign; she approached; again she paused within\r\n      half a yard of the estrade, and looked shy, and still doubtful whether she\r\n      had mistaken my meaning.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cStep up,\u201d I said, speaking with decision. It is the only way of dealing\r\n      with diffident, easily embarrassed characters, and with some slight manual\r\n      aid I presently got her placed just where I wanted her to be, that is,\r\n      between my desk and the window, where she was screened from the rush of\r\n      the second division, and where no one could sneak behind her to listen.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cTake a seat,\u201d I said, placing a tabouret; and I made her sit down. I knew\r\n      what I was doing would be considered a very strange thing, and, what was\r\n      more, I did not care. Frances knew it also, and, I fear, by an appearance\r\n      of agitation and trembling, that she cared much. I drew from my pocket the\r\n      rolled-up devoir.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThis is yours, I suppose?\u201d said I, addressing her in English, for I now\r\n      felt sure she could speak English.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d she answered distinctly; and as I unrolled it and laid it out flat\r\n      on the desk before her with my hand upon it, and a pencil in that hand, I\r\n      saw her moved, and, as it were, kindled; her depression beamed as a cloud\r\n      might behind which the sun is burning.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThis devoir has numerous faults,\u201d said I. \u201cIt will take you some years of\r\n      careful study before you are in a condition to write English with absolute\r\n      correctness. Attend: I will point out some principal defects.\u201d And I went\r\n      through it carefully, noting every error, and demonstrating why they were\r\n      errors, and how the words or phrases ought to have been written. In the\r\n      course of this sobering process she became calm. I now went on:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAs to the substance of your devoir, Mdlle. Henri, it has surprised me; I\r\n      perused it with pleasure, because I saw in it some proofs of taste and\r\n      fancy. Taste and fancy are not the highest gifts of the human mind, but\r\n      such as they are you possess them\u2014not probably in a paramount\r\n      degree, but in a degree beyond what the majority can boast. You may then\r\n      take courage; cultivate the faculties that God and nature have bestowed on\r\n      you, and do not fear in any crisis of suffering, under any pressure of\r\n      injustice, to derive free and full consolation from the consciousness of\r\n      their strength and rarity.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStrength and rarity!\u201d I repeated to myself; \u201cay, the words are probably\r\n      true,\u201d for on looking up, I saw the sun had dissevered its screening\r\n      cloud, her countenance was transfigured, a smile shone in her eyes\u2014a\r\n      smile almost triumphant; it seemed to say\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI am glad you have been forced to discover so much of my nature; you need\r\n      not so carefully moderate your language. Do you think I am myself a\r\n      stranger to myself? What you tell me in terms so qualified, I have known\r\n      fully from a child.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She did say this as plainly as a frank and flashing glance could, but in a\r\n      moment the glow of her complexion, the radiance of her aspect, had\r\n      subsided; if strongly conscious of her talents, she was equally conscious\r\n      of her harassing defects, and the remembrance of these obliterated for a\r\n      single second, now reviving with sudden force, at once subdued the too\r\n      vivid characters in which her sense of her powers had been expressed. So\r\n      quick was the revulsion of feeling, I had not time to check her triumph by\r\n      reproof; ere I could contract my brows to a frown she had become serious\r\n      and almost mournful-looking.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said she, rising. There was gratitude both in her voice\r\n      and in the look with which she accompanied it. It was time, indeed, for\r\n      our conference to terminate; for, when I glanced around, behold all the\r\n      boarders (the day-scholars had departed) were congregated within a yard or\r\n      two of my desk, and stood staring with eyes and mouths wide open; the\r\n      three ma\u00eetresses formed a whispering knot in one corner, and, close at my\r\n      elbow, was the directress, sitting on a low chair, calmly clipping the\r\n      tassels of her finished purse.\r\n    \n"}
{"17": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVII.\r\n    \n\r\n      AFTER all I had profited but imperfectly by the opportunity I had so\r\n      boldly achieved of speaking to Mdlle. Henri; it was my intention to ask\r\n      her how she came to be possessed of two English baptismal names, Frances\r\n      and Evans, in addition to her French surname, also whence she derived her\r\n      good accent. I had forgotten both points, or, rather, our colloquy had\r\n      been so brief that I had not had time to bring them forward; moreover, I\r\n      had not half tested her powers of speaking English; all I had drawn from\r\n      her in that language were the words \u201cYes,\u201d and \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d \u201cNo\r\n      matter,\u201d I reflected. \u201cWhat has been left incomplete now, shall be\r\n      finished another day.\u201d Nor did I fail to keep the promise thus made to\r\n      myself. It was difficult to get even a few words of particular\r\n      conversation with one pupil among so many; but, according to the old\r\n      proverb, \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way;\u201d and again and again I\r\n      managed to find an opportunity for exchanging a few words with Mdlle.\r\n      Henri, regardless that envy stared and detraction whispered whenever I\r\n      approached her.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYour book an instant.\u201d Such was the mode in which I often began these\r\n      brief dialogues; the time was always just at the conclusion of the lesson;\r\n      and motioning to her to rise, I installed myself in her place, allowing\r\n      her to stand deferentially at my side; for I esteemed it wise and right in\r\n      her case to enforce strictly all forms ordinarily in use between master\r\n      and pupil; the rather because I perceived that in proportion as my manner\r\n      grew austere and magisterial, hers became easy and self-possessed\u2014an\r\n      odd contradiction, doubtless, to the ordinary effect in such cases; but so\r\n      it was.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA pencil,\u201d said I, holding out my hand without looking at her. (I am now\r\n      about to sketch a brief report of the first of these conferences.) She\r\n      gave me one, and while I underlined some errors in a grammatical exercise\r\n      she had written, I observed\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou are not a native of Belgium?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNor of France?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhere, then, is your birthplace?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI was born at Geneva.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t call Frances and Evans Swiss names, I presume?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir; they are English names.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJust so; and is it the custom of the Genevese to give their children\r\n      English appellatives?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNon, Monsieur; mais\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSpeak English, if you please.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cEnglish\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut\u201d (slowly and with embarrassment) \u201cmy parents were not all the two\r\n      Genevese.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSay both, instead of \u2018all the two,\u2019 mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot both Swiss: my mother was English.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh! and of English extraction?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014her ancestors were all English.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd your father?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHe was Swiss.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat besides?

I learn my lessons well\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, a child can do that! and what more do you do?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat more can I do?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, certainly, not much; but you are a teacher, are you not, as well as a\r\n      pupil?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou teach lace-mending?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA dull, stupid occupation; do you like it?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014it is tedious.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you pursue it?

What then were your friends\u2014what was your aunt about? She\r\n      is very much to blame.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo monsieur, no\u2014my aunt is good\u2014she is not to blame\u2014she\r\n      does what she can; she lodges and nourishes me\u201d (I report Mdlle. Henri\u2019s\r\n      phrases literally, and it was thus she translated from the French). \u201cShe\r\n      is not rich; she has only an annuity of twelve hundred francs, and it\r\n      would be impossible for her to send me to school.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cRather,\u201d thought I to myself on hearing this, but I continued, in the\r\n      dogmatical tone I had adopted:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is sad, however, that you should be brought up in ignorance of the\r\n      most ordinary branches of education; had you known something of history\r\n      and grammar you might, by degrees, have relinquished your lace-mending\r\n      drudgery, and risen in the world.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt is what I mean to do.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHow? By a knowledge of English alone? That will not suffice; no\r\n      respectable family will receive a governess whose whole stock of knowledge\r\n      consists in a familiarity with one foreign language.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I know other things.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, you can work with Berlin wools, and embroider handkerchiefs and\r\n      collars\u2014that will do little for you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Mdlle. Henri\u2019s lips were unclosed to answer, but she checked herself, as\r\n      thinking the discussion had been sufficiently pursued, and remained\r\n      silent.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSpeak,\u201d I continued, impatiently; \u201cI never like the appearance of\r\n      acquiescence when the reality is not there; and you had a contradiction at\r\n      your tongue\u2019s end.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I have had many lessons both in grammar, history, geography,\r\n      and arithmetic. I have gone through a course of each study.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBravo! but how did you manage it, since your aunt could not afford to\r\n      send you to school?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBy lace-mending; by the thing monsieur despises so much.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTruly! And now, mademoiselle, it will be a good exercise for you to\r\n      explain to me in English how such a result was produced by such means.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I begged my aunt to have me taught lace-mending soon after we\r\n      came to Brussels, because I knew it was a m\u00e9tier, a trade which was easily\r\n      learnt, and by which I could earn some money very soon. I learnt it in a\r\n      few days, and I quickly got work, for all the Brussels ladies have old\r\n      lace\u2014very precious\u2014which must be mended all the times it is\r\n      washed. I earned money a little, and this money I gave for lessons in the\r\n      studies I have mentioned; some of it I spent in buying books, English\r\n      books especially; soon I shall try to find a place of governess, or\r\n      school-teacher, when I can write and speak English well; but it will be\r\n      difficult, because those who know I have been a lace-mender will despise\r\n      me, as the pupils here despise me. Pourtant j\u2019ai mon projet,\u201d she added in\r\n      a lower tone.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI will go and live in England; I will teach French there.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The words were pronounced emphatically. She said \u201cEngland\u201d as you might\r\n      suppose an Israelite of Moses\u2019 days would have said Canaan.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHave you a wish to see England?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, and an intention.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And here a voice, the voice of the directress, interposed:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Henri, je crois qu\u2019il va pleuvoir; vous feriez bien, ma\r\n      bonne amie, de retourner chez vous tout de suite.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      In silence, without a word of thanks for this officious warning, Mdlle.\r\n      Henri collected her books; she moved to me respectfully, endeavoured to\r\n      move to her superior, though the endeavour was almost a failure, for her\r\n      head seemed as if it would not bend, and thus departed.\r\n    \n\r\n      Where there is one grain of perseverance or wilfulness in the composition,\r\n      trifling obstacles are ever known rather to stimulate than discourage.\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter might as well have spared herself the trouble of giving that\r\n      intimation about the weather (by-the-by her prediction was falsified by\r\n      the event\u2014it did not rain that evening). At the close of the next\r\n      lesson I was again at Mdlle. Henri\u2019s desk. Thus did I accost her:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat is your idea of England, mademoiselle? Why do you wish to go there?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Accustomed by this time to the calculated abruptness of my manner, it no\r\n      longer discomposed or surprised her, and she answered with only so much of\r\n      hesitation as was rendered inevitable by the difficulty she experienced in\r\n      improvising the translation of her thoughts from French to English.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEngland is something unique, as I have heard and read; my idea of it is\r\n      vague, and I want to go there to render my idea clear, definite.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHum! How much of England do you suppose you could see if you went there\r\n      in the capacity of a teacher? A strange notion you must have of getting a\r\n      clear and definite idea of a country! All you could see of Great Britain\r\n      would be the interior of a school, or at most of one or two private\r\n      dwellings.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt would be an English school; they would be English dwellings.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndisputably; but what then? What would be the value of observations made\r\n      on a scale so narrow?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, might not one learn something by analogy? An\u2014\u00e9chantillon\u2014a\u2014a\r\n      sample often serves to give an idea of the whole; besides, narrow and wide\r\n      are words comparative, are they not? All my life would perhaps seem narrow\r\n      in your eyes\u2014all the life of a\u2014that little animal subterranean\u2014une\r\n      taupe\u2014comment dit-on?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMole.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014a mole, which lives underground would seem narrow even to me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, mademoiselle\u2014what then? Proceed.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais, monsieur, vous me comprenez.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot in the least; have the goodness to explain.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy, monsieur, it is just so. In Switzerland I have done but little,\r\n      learnt but little, and seen but little; my life there was in a circle; I\r\n      walked the same round every day; I could not get out of it; had I\r\n      rested\u2014remained there even till my death, I should never have enlarged it,\r\n      because I am poor and not skilful, I have not great acquirements; when I\r\n      was quite tired of this round, I begged my aunt to go to Brussels; my\r\n      existence is no larger here, because I am no richer or higher; I walk in\r\n      as narrow a limit, but the scene is changed; it would change again if I\r\n      went to England. I knew something of the bourgeois of Geneva, now I know\r\n      something of the bourgeois of Brussels; if I went to London, I would know\r\n      something of the bourgeois of London. Can you make any sense out of what I\r\n      say, monsieur, or is it all obscure?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI see, I see\u2014now let us advert to another subject; you propose to\r\n      devote your life to teaching, and you are a most unsuccessful teacher; you\r\n      cannot keep your pupils in order.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      A flush of painful confusion was the result of this harsh remark; she bent\r\n      her head to the desk, but soon raising it replied\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I am not a skilful teacher, it is true, but practice improves;\r\n      besides, I work under difficulties; here I only teach sewing, I can show\r\n      no power in sewing, no superiority\u2014it is a subordinate art; then I\r\n      have no associates in this house, I am isolated; I am too a heretic, which\r\n      deprives me of influence.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd in England you would be a foreigner; that too would deprive you of\r\n      influence, and would effectually separate you from all round you; in\r\n      England you would have as few connections, as little importance as you\r\n      have here.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut I should be learning something; for the rest, there are probably\r\n      difficulties for such as I everywhere, and if I must contend, and perhaps\r\n      be conquered, I would rather submit to English pride than to Flemish\r\n      coarseness; besides, monsieur\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She stopped\u2014not evidently from any difficulty in finding words to\r\n      express herself, but because discretion seemed to say, \u201cYou have said\r\n      enough.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cFinish your phrase,\u201d I urged.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBesides, monsieur, I long to live once more among Protestants; they are\r\n      more honest than Catholics; a Romish school is a building with porous\r\n      walls, a hollow floor, a false ceiling; every room in this house,\r\n      monsieur, has eyeholes and ear-holes, and what the house is, the\r\n      inhabitants are, very treacherous; they all think it lawful to tell lies;\r\n      they all call it politeness to profess friendship where they feel hatred.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAll?\u201d said I; \u201cyou mean the pupils\u2014the mere children\u2014inexperienced,\r\n      giddy things, who have not learnt to distinguish the difference between\r\n      right and wrong?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, monsieur\u2014the children are the most sincere; they\r\n      have not yet had time to become accomplished in duplicity; they will tell\r\n      lies, but they do it inartificially, and you know they are lying; but the\r\n      grown-up people are very false; they deceive strangers, they deceive each\r\n      other\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      A servant here entered:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMdlle. Henri\u2014Mdlle. Reuter vous prie de vouloir bien conduire la\r\n      petite de Dorlodot chez elle, elle vous attend dans le cabinet de Rosalie\r\n      la porti\u00e8re\u2014c\u2019est que sa bonne n\u2019est pas venue la chercher\u2014voyez-vous.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cEh bien! est-ce que je suis sa bonne\u2014moi?\u201d demanded Mdlle. Henri;\r\n      then smiling, with that same bitter, derisive smile I had seen on her lips\r\n      once before, she hastily rose and made her exit.\r\n    \n"}
{"18": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n    \n\r\n      THE young Anglo-Swiss evidently derived both pleasure and profit from the\r\n      study of her mother-tongue. In teaching her I did not, of course, confine\r\n      myself to the ordinary school routine; I made instruction in English a\r\n      channel for instruction in literature. I prescribed to her a course of\r\n      reading; she had a little selection of English classics, a few of which\r\n      had been left her by her mother, and the others she had purchased with her\r\n      own penny-fee. I lent her some more modern works; all these she read with\r\n      avidity, giving me, in writing, a clear summary of each work when she had\r\n      perused it. Composition, too, she delighted in. Such occupation seemed the\r\n      very breath of her nostrils, and soon her improved productions wrung from\r\n      me the avowal that those qualities in her I had termed taste and fancy\r\n      ought rather to have been denominated judgment and imagination. When I\r\n      intimated so much, which I did as usual in dry and stinted phrase, I\r\n      looked for the radiant and exulting smile my one word of eulogy had\r\n      elicited before; but Frances coloured. If she did smile, it was very\r\n      softly and shyly; and instead of looking up to me with a conquering\r\n      glance, her eyes rested on my hand, which, stretched over her shoulder,\r\n      was writing some directions with a pencil on the margin of her book.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, are you pleased that I am satisfied with your progress?\u201d I asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said she slowly, gently, the blush that had half subsided\r\n      returning.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBut I do not say enough, I suppose?\u201d I continued. \u201cMy praises are too\r\n      cool?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She made no answer, and, I thought, looked a little sad. I divined her\r\n      thoughts, and should much have liked to have responded to them, had it\r\n      been expedient so to do. She was not now very ambitious of my\r\n      admiration\u2014not eagerly desirous of dazzling me; a little affection\u2014ever so\r\n      little\u2014pleased her better than all the panegyrics in the world. Feeling\r\n      this, I stood a good while behind her, writing on the margin of her book.\r\n      I could hardly quit my station or relinquish my occupation; something\r\n      retained me bending there, my head very near hers, and my hand near hers\r\n      too; but the margin of a copy-book is not an illimitable space\u2014so,\r\n      doubtless, the directress thought; and she took occasion to walk past in\r\n      order to ascertain by what art I prolonged so disproportionately the\r\n      period necessary for filling it. I was obliged to go. Distasteful\r\n      effort\u2014to leave what we most prefer!\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances did not become pale or feeble in consequence of her sedentary\r\n      employment; perhaps the stimulus it communicated to her mind\r\n      counterbalanced the inaction it imposed on her body. She changed, indeed,\r\n      changed obviously and rapidly; but it was for the better. When I first saw\r\n      her, her countenance was sunless, her complexion colourless; she looked\r\n      like one who had no source of enjoyment, no store of bliss anywhere in the\r\n      world; now the cloud had passed from her mien, leaving space for the dawn\r\n      of hope and interest, and those feelings rose like a clear morning,\r\n      animating what had been depressed, tinting what had been pale. Her eyes,\r\n      whose colour I had not at first known, so dim were they with repressed\r\n      tears, so shadowed with ceaseless dejection, now, lit by a ray of the\r\n      sunshine that cheered her heart, revealed irids of bright hazel\u2014irids\r\n      large and full, screened with long lashes; and pupils instinct with fire.\r\n      That look of wan emaciation which anxiety or low spirits often\r\n      communicates to a thoughtful, thin face, rather long than round, having\r\n      vanished from hers, a clearness of skin almost bloom, and a plumpness\r\n      almost embonpoint, softened the decided lines of her features. Her figure\r\n      shared in this beneficial change; it became rounder, and as the harmony of\r\n      her form was complete and her stature of the graceful middle height, one\r\n      did not regret (or at least I did not regret) the absence of\r\n      confirmed fulness, in contours, still slight, though compact, elegant,\r\n      flexible\u2014the exquisite turning of waist, wrist, hand, foot, and ankle\r\n      satisfied completely my notions of symmetry, and allowed a lightness and\r\n      freedom of movement which corresponded with my ideas of grace.\r\n    \n\r\n      Thus improved, thus wakened to life, Mdlle. Henri began to take a new\r\n      footing in the school; her mental power, manifested gradually but\r\n      steadily, ere long extorted recognition even from the envious; and when\r\n      the young and healthy saw that she could smile brightly, converse gaily,\r\n      move with vivacity and alertness, they acknowledged in her a sisterhood of\r\n      youth and health, and tolerated her as of their kind accordingly.\r\n    \n\r\n      To speak truth, I watched this change much as a gardener watches the\r\n      growth of a precious plant, and I contributed to it too, even as the said\r\n      gardener contributes to the development of his favourite. To me it was not\r\n      difficult to discover how I could best foster my pupil, cherish her\r\n      starved feelings, and induce the outward manifestation of that inward\r\n      vigour which sunless drought and blighting blast had hitherto forbidden to\r\n      expand. Constancy of attention\u2014a kindness as mute as watchful,\r\n      always standing by her, cloaked in the rough garb of austerity, and making\r\n      its real nature known only by a rare glance of interest, or a cordial and\r\n      gentle word; real respect masked with seeming imperiousness, directing,\r\n      urging her actions, yet helping her too, and that with devoted care: these\r\n      were the means I used, for these means best suited Frances\u2019 feelings, as\r\n      susceptible as deep vibrating\u2014her nature at once proud and shy.\r\n    \n\r\n      The benefits of my system became apparent also in her altered demeanour as\r\n      a teacher; she now took her place amongst her pupils with an air of spirit\r\n      and firmness which assured them at once that she meant to be obeyed\u2014and\r\n      obeyed she was. They felt they had lost their power over her. If any girl\r\n      had rebelled, she would no longer have taken her rebellion to heart; she\r\n      possessed a source of comfort they could not drain, a pillar of support\r\n      they could not overthrow: formerly, when insulted, she wept; now, she\r\n      smiled.\r\n    \n\r\n      The public reading of one of her devoirs achieved the revelation of her\r\n      talents to all and sundry; I remember the subject\u2014it was an\r\n      emigrant\u2019s letter to his friends at home. It opened with simplicity; some\r\n      natural and graphic touches disclosed to the reader the scene of virgin\r\n      forest and great, New-World river\u2014barren of sail and flag\u2014amidst\r\n      which the epistle was supposed to be indited. The difficulties and dangers\r\n      that attend a settler\u2019s life, were hinted at; and in the few words said on\r\n      that subject, Mdlle. Henri failed not to render audible the voice of\r\n      resolve, patience, endeavour. The disasters which had driven him from his\r\n      native country were alluded to; stainless honour, inflexible independence,\r\n      indestructible self-respect there took the word. Past days were spoken of;\r\n      the grief of parting, the regrets of absence, were touched upon; feeling,\r\n      forcible and fine, breathed eloquent in every period. At the close,\r\n      consolation was suggested; religious faith became there the speaker, and\r\n      she spoke well.\r\n    \n\r\n      The devoir was powerfully written in language at once chaste and choice,\r\n      in a style nerved with vigour and graced with harmony.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter was quite sufficiently acquainted with English to understand\r\n      it when read or spoken in her presence, though she could neither speak nor\r\n      write it herself. During the perusal of this devoir, she sat placidly\r\n      busy, her eyes and fingers occupied with the formation of a \u201crivi\u00e8re\u201d or\r\n      open-work hem round a cambric handkerchief; she said nothing, and her face\r\n      and forehead, clothed with a mask of purely negative expression, were as\r\n      blank of comment as her lips. As neither surprise, pleasure, approbation,\r\n      nor interest were evinced in her countenance, so no more were disdain,\r\n      envy, annoyance, weariness; if that inscrutable mien said anything, it was\r\n      simply this\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThe matter is too trite to excite an emotion, or call forth an opinion.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      As soon as I had done, a hum rose; several of the pupils, pressing round\r\n      Mdlle. Henri, began to beset her with compliments; the composed voice of\r\n      the directress was now heard:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYoung ladies, such of you as have cloaks and umbrellas will hasten to\r\n      return home before the shower becomes heavier\u201d (it was raining a little),\r\n      \u201cthe remainder will wait till their respective servants arrive to fetch\r\n      them.\u201d And the school dispersed, for it was four o\u2019clock.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, a word,\u201d said Mdlle. Reuter, stepping on to the estrade, and\r\n      signifying, by a movement of the hand, that she wished me to relinquish,\r\n      for an instant, the castor I had clutched.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, I am at your service.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, it is of course an excellent plan to encourage effort in young\r\n      people by making conspicuous the progress of any particularly industrious\r\n      pupil; but do you not think that in the present instance, Mdlle. Henri can\r\n      hardly be considered as a concurrent with the other pupils? She is older\r\n      than most of them, and has had advantages of an exclusive nature for\r\n      acquiring a knowledge of English; on the other hand, her sphere of life is\r\n      somewhat beneath theirs; under these circumstances, a public distinction,\r\n      conferred upon Mdlle. Henri, may be the means of suggesting comparisons,\r\n      and exciting feelings such as would be far from advantageous to the\r\n      individual forming their object. The interest I take in Mdlle. Henri\u2019s\r\n      real welfare makes me desirous of screening her from annoyances of this\r\n      sort; besides, monsieur, as I have before hinted to you, the sentiment of\r\n      amour-propre has a somewhat marked preponderance in her\r\n      character; celebrity has a tendency to foster this sentiment, and in her\r\n      it should be rather repressed\u2014she rather needs keeping down than bringing\r\n      forward; and then I think, monsieur\u2014it appears to me that ambition,\r\n      literary ambition especially, is not a feeling to be cherished in\r\n      the mind of a woman: would not Mdlle. Henri be much safer and happier if\r\n      taught to believe that in the quiet discharge of social duties consists\r\n      her real vocation, than if stimulated to aspire after applause and\r\n      publicity? She may never marry; scanty as are her resources, obscure as\r\n      are her connections, uncertain as is her health (for I think her\r\n      consumptive, her mother died of that complaint), it is more than probable\r\n      she never will. I do not see how she can rise to a position, whence such a\r\n      step would be possible; but even in celibacy it would be better for her to\r\n      retain the character and habits of a respectable decorous female.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndisputably, mademoiselle,\u201d was my answer. \u201cYour opinion admits of no\r\n      doubt;\u201d and, fearful of the harangue being renewed, I retreated under\r\n      cover of that cordial sentence of assent.\r\n    \n\r\n      At the date of a fortnight after the little incident noted above, I find\r\n      it recorded in my diary that a hiatus occurred in Mdlle. Henri\u2019s usually\r\n      regular attendance in class. The first day or two I wondered at her\r\n      absence, but did not like to ask an explanation of it; I thought indeed\r\n      some chance word might be dropped which would afford me the information I\r\n      wished to obtain, without my running the risk of exciting silly smiles and\r\n      gossiping whispers by demanding it. But when a week passed and the seat at\r\n      the desk near the door still remained vacant, and when no allusion was\r\n      made to the circumstance by any individual of the class\u2014when, on the\r\n      contrary, I found that all observed a marked silence on the point\u2014I\r\n      determined, co\u00fbte qui co\u00fbte, to break the ice of this\r\n      silly reserve. I selected Sylvie as my informant, because from her I knew\r\n      that I should at least get a sensible answer, unaccompanied by wriggle,\r\n      titter, or other flourish of folly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cO\u00f9 donc est Mdlle. Henri?\u201d I said one day as I returned an exercise-book\r\n      I had been examining.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cElle est partie, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPartie? et pour combien de temps? Quand reviendra-t-elle?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cElle est partie pour toujours, monsieur; elle ne reviendra plus.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d was my involuntary exclamation; then after a pause:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEn \u00eates-vous bien s\u00fbre, Sylvie?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOui, oui, monsieur, mademoiselle la directrice nous l\u2019a dit elle-m\u00eame il\r\n      y a deux ou trois jours.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And I could pursue my inquiries no further; time, place, and circumstances\r\n      forbade my adding another word. I could neither comment on what had been\r\n      said, nor demand further particulars. A question as to the reason of the\r\n      teacher\u2019s departure, as to whether it had been voluntary or otherwise, was\r\n      indeed on my lips, but I suppressed it\u2014there were listeners all\r\n      round. An hour after, in passing Sylvie in the corridor as she was putting\r\n      on her bonnet, I stopped short and asked:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSylvie, do you know Mdlle. Henri\u2019s address? I have some books of hers,\u201d I\r\n      added carelessly, \u201cand I should wish to send them to her.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur,\u201d replied Sylvie; \u201cbut perhaps Rosalie, the portress, will\r\n      be able to give it you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Rosalie\u2019s cabinet was just at hand; I stepped in and repeated the inquiry.\r\n      Rosalie\u2014a smart French grisette\u2014looked up from her work with a\r\n      knowing smile, precisely the sort of smile I had been so desirous to avoid\r\n      exciting. Her answer was prepared; she knew nothing whatever of Mdlle.\r\n      Henri\u2019s address\u2014had never known it. Turning from her with impatience\u2014for\r\n      I believed she lied and was hired to lie\u2014I almost knocked down some\r\n      one who had been standing at my back; it was the directress. My abrupt\r\n      movement made her recoil two or three steps. I was obliged to apologize,\r\n      which I did more concisely than politely. No man likes to be dogged, and\r\n      in the very irritable mood in which I then was the sight of Mdlle. Reuter\r\n      thoroughly incensed me. At the moment I turned her countenance looked\r\n      hard, dark, and inquisitive; her eyes were bent upon me with an expression\r\n      of almost hungry curiosity. I had scarcely caught this phase of\r\n      physiognomy ere it had vanished; a bland smile played on her features; my\r\n      harsh apology was received with good-humoured facility.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOh, don\u2019t mention it, monsieur; you only touched my hair with your elbow;\r\n      it is no worse, only a little dishevelled.\u201d She shook it back, and passing\r\n      her fingers through her curls, loosened them into more numerous and\r\n      flowing ringlets. Then she went on with vivacity:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cRosalie, I was coming to tell you to go instantly and close the windows\r\n      of the salon; the wind is rising, and the muslin curtains will be covered\r\n      with dust.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Rosalie departed. \u201cNow,\u201d thought I, \u201cthis will not do; Mdlle. Reuter\r\n      thinks her meanness in eaves-dropping is screened by her art in devising a\r\n      pretext, whereas the muslin curtains she speaks of are not more\r\n      transparent than this same pretext.\u201d An impulse came over me to thrust the\r\n      flimsy screen aside, and confront her craft boldly with a word or two of\r\n      plain truth. \u201cThe rough-shod foot treads most firmly on slippery ground,\u201d\r\n       thought I; so I began:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Henri has left your establishment\u2014been dismissed, I\r\n      presume?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh, I wished to have a little conversation with you, monsieur,\u201d replied\r\n      the directress with the most natural and affable air in the world; \u201cbut we\r\n      cannot talk quietly here; will Monsieur step into the garden a minute?\u201d\r\n       And she preceded me, stepping out through the glass-door I have before\r\n      mentioned.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere,\u201d said she, when we had reached the centre of the middle alley, and\r\n      when the foliage of shrubs and trees, now in their summer pride, closing\r\n      behind and around us, shut out the view of the house, and thus imparted a\r\n      sense of seclusion even to this little plot of ground in the very core of\r\n      a capital.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere, one feels quiet and free when there are only pear-trees and\r\n      rose-bushes about one; I dare say you, like me, monsieur, are sometimes\r\n      tired of being eternally in the midst of life; of having human faces\r\n      always round you, human eyes always upon you, human voices always in your\r\n      ear. I am sure I often wish intensely for liberty to spend a whole month\r\n      in the country at some little farm-house, bien gentille, bien propre, tout\r\n      entour\u00e9e de champs et de bois; quelle vie charmante que la vie champ\u00eatre!\r\n      N\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCela d\u00e9pend, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cQue le vent est bon et frais!\u201d continued the directress; and she was\r\n      right there, for it was a south wind, soft and sweet. I carried my hat in\r\n      my hand, and this gentle breeze, passing through my hair, soothed my\r\n      temples like balm. Its refreshing effect, however, penetrated no deeper\r\n      than the mere surface of the frame; for as I walked by the side of Mdlle.\r\n      Reuter, my heart was still hot within me, and while I was musing the fire\r\n      burned; then spake I with my tongue:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI understand Mdlle. Henri is gone from hence, and will not return?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh, true! I meant to have named the subject to you some days ago, but my\r\n      time is so completely taken up, I cannot do half the things I wish: have\r\n      you never experienced what it is, monsieur, to find the day too short by\r\n      twelve hours for your numerous duties?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot often. Mdlle. Henri\u2019s departure was not voluntary, I presume? If it\r\n      had been, she would certainly have given me some intimation of it, being\r\n      my pupil.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, did she not tell you? that was strange; for my part, I never thought\r\n      of adverting to the subject; when one has so many things to attend to, one\r\n      is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary importance.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou consider Mdlle. Henri\u2019s dismission, then, as a very insignificant\r\n      event?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDismission? Ah! she was not dismissed; I can say with truth, monsieur,\r\n      that since I became the head of this establishment no master or teacher\r\n      has ever been dismissed from it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYet some have left it, mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMany; I have found it necessary to change frequently\u2014a change of\r\n      instructors is often beneficial to the interests of a school; it gives\r\n      life and variety to the proceedings; it amuses the pupils, and suggests to\r\n      the parents the idea of exertion and progress.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYet when you are tired of a professor or ma\u00eetresse, you scruple to\r\n      dismiss them?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo need to have recourse to such extreme measures, I assure you. Allons,\r\n      monsieur le professeur\u2014asseyons-nous; je vais vous donner une petite\r\n      le\u00e7on dans votre \u00e9tat d\u2019instituteur.\u201d (I wish I might write all she said\r\n      to me in French\u2014it loses sadly by being translated into English.) We\r\n      had now reached the garden-chair; the directress sat down, and\r\n      signed to me to sit by her, but I only rested my knee on the seat, and\r\n      stood leaning my head and arm against the embowering branch of a huge\r\n      laburnum, whose golden flowers, blent with the dusky green leaves of a\r\n      lilac-bush, formed a mixed arch of shade and sunshine over the retreat.\r\n      Mdlle. Reuter sat silent a moment; some novel movements were evidently\r\n      working in her mind, and they showed their nature on her astute brow; she\r\n      was meditating some chef d\u2019oeuvre of policy. Convinced by\r\n      several months\u2019 experience that the affectation of virtues she did not\r\n      possess was unavailing to ensnare me\u2014aware that I had read her real\r\n      nature, and would believe nothing of the character she gave out as being\r\n      hers\u2014she had determined, at last, to try a new key, and see if the lock of\r\n      my heart would yield to that; a little audacity, a word of truth, a\r\n      glimpse of the real. \u201cYes, I will try,\u201d was her inward resolve; and then\r\n      her blue eye glittered upon me\u2014it did not flash\u2014nothing of flame ever\r\n      kindled in its temperate gleam.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur fears to sit by me?\u201d she inquired playfully.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI have no wish to usurp Pelet\u2019s place,\u201d I answered, for I had got the\r\n      habit of speaking to her bluntly\u2014a habit begun in anger, but\r\n      continued because I saw that, instead of offending, it fascinated her. She\r\n      cast down her eyes, and drooped her eyelids; she sighed uneasily; she\r\n      turned with an anxious gesture, as if she would give me the idea of a bird\r\n      that flutters in its cage, and would fain fly from its jail and jailer,\r\n      and seek its natural mate and pleasant nest.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell\u2014and your lesson?\u201d I demanded briefly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d she exclaimed, recovering herself, \u201cyou are so young, so frank and\r\n      fearless, so talented, so impatient of imbecility, so disdainful of\r\n      vulgarity, you need a lesson; here it is then: far more is to be done in\r\n      this world by dexterity than by strength; but, perhaps, you knew that\r\n      before, for there is delicacy as well as power in your character\u2014policy,\r\n      as well as pride?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGo on,\u201d said I; and I could hardly help smiling, the flattery was so\r\n      piquant, so finely seasoned. She caught the prohibited smile, though I\r\n      passed my hand over my mouth to conceal it; and again she made room for me\r\n      to sit beside her. I shook my head, though temptation penetrated to my\r\n      senses at the moment, and once more I told her to go on.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, if ever you are at the head of a large establishment, dismiss\r\n      nobody. To speak truth, monsieur (and to you I will speak truth), I\r\n      despise people who are always making rows, blustering, sending off one to\r\n      the right, and another to the left, urging and hurrying circumstances.\r\n      I\u2019ll tell you what I like best to do, monsieur, shall I?\u201d She looked up\r\n      again; she had compounded her glance well this time\u2014much archness,\r\n      more deference, a spicy dash of coquetry, an unveiled consciousness of\r\n      capacity. I nodded; she treated me like the great Mogul; so I became the\r\n      great Mogul as far as she was concerned.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI like, monsieur, to take my knitting in my hands, and to sit quietly\r\n      down in my chair; circumstances defile past me; I watch their march; so\r\n      long as they follow the course I wish, I say nothing, and do nothing; I\r\n      don\u2019t clap my hands, and cry out \u2018Bravo! How lucky I am!\u2019 to attract the\r\n      attention and envy of my neighbours\u2014I am merely passive; but when\r\n      events fall out ill\u2014when circumstances become adverse\u2014I watch\r\n      very vigilantly; I knit on still, and still I hold my tongue; but every\r\n      now and then, monsieur, I just put my toe out\u2014so\u2014and give the\r\n      rebellious circumstance a little secret push, without noise, which sends\r\n      it the way I wish, and I am successful after all, and nobody has seen my\r\n      expedient. So, when teachers or masters become troublesome and\r\n      inefficient\u2014when, in short, the interests of the school would suffer from\r\n      their retaining their places\u2014I mind my knitting, events progress,\r\n      circumstances glide past; I see one which, if pushed ever so little awry,\r\n      will render untenable the post I wish to have vacated\u2014the deed is done\u2014the\r\n      stumbling-block removed\u2014and no one saw me: I have not made an enemy,\r\n      I am rid of an incumbrance.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      A moment since, and I thought her alluring; this speech concluded, I\r\n      looked on her with distaste. \u201cJust like you,\u201d was my cold answer. \u201cAnd in\r\n      this way you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? You wanted her office, therefore\r\n      you rendered it intolerable to her?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot at all, monsieur, I was merely anxious about Mdlle. Henri\u2019s health;\r\n      no, your moral sight is clear and piercing, but there you have failed to\r\n      discover the truth. I took\u2014I have always taken a real interest in\r\n      Mdlle. Henri\u2019s welfare; I did not like her going out in all weathers; I\r\n      thought it would be more advantageous for her to obtain a permanent\r\n      situation; besides, I considered her now qualified to do something more\r\n      than teach sewing. I reasoned with her; left the decision to herself; she\r\n      saw the correctness of my views, and adopted them.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cExcellent! and now, mademoiselle, you will have the goodness to give me\r\n      her address.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHer address!\u201d and a sombre and stony change came over the mien of the\r\n      directress. \u201cHer address? Ah?\u2014well\u2014I wish I could oblige you,\r\n      monsieur, but I cannot, and I will tell you why; whenever I myself asked\r\n      her for her address, she always evaded the inquiry. I thought\u2014I may\r\n      be wrong\u2014but I thought her motive for doing so, was a natural,\r\n      though mistaken reluctance to introduce me to some, probably, very poor\r\n      abode; her means were narrow, her origin obscure; she lives somewhere,\r\n      doubtless, in the \u2018basse ville.\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll not lose sight of my best pupil yet,\u201d said I, \u201cthough she were born\r\n      of beggars and lodged in a cellar; for the rest, it is absurd to make a\r\n      bugbear of her origin to me\u2014I happen to know that she was a Swiss\r\n      pastor\u2019s daughter, neither more nor less; and, as to her narrow means, I\r\n      care nothing for the poverty of her purse so long as her heart overflows\r\n      with affluence.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour sentiments are perfectly noble, monsieur,\u201d said the directress,\r\n      affecting to suppress a yawn; her sprightliness was now extinct, her\r\n      temporary candour shut up; the little, red-coloured, piratical-looking\r\n      pennon of audacity she had allowed to float a minute in the air, was\r\n      furled, and the broad, sober-hued flag of dissimulation again hung low\r\n      over the citadel. I did not like her thus, so I cut short the\r\n      t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and departed.\r\n    \n"}
{"19": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIX.\r\n    \n\r\n      NOVELISTS should never allow themselves to weary of the study of real\r\n      life. If they observed this duty conscientiously, they would give us fewer\r\n      pictures chequered with vivid contrasts of light and shade; they would\r\n      seldom elevate their heroes and heroines to the heights of rapture\u2014still\r\n      seldomer sink them to the depths of despair; for if we rarely taste the\r\n      fulness of joy in this life, we yet more rarely savour the acrid\r\n      bitterness of hopeless anguish; unless, indeed, we have plunged like\r\n      beasts into sensual indulgence, abused, strained, stimulated, again\r\n      overstrained, and, at last, destroyed our faculties for enjoyment; then,\r\n      truly, we may find ourselves without support, robbed of hope. Our agony is\r\n      great, and how can it end? We have broken the spring of our powers; life\r\n      must be all suffering\u2014too feeble to conceive faith\u2014death must\r\n      be darkness\u2014God, spirits, religion can have no place in our\r\n      collapsed minds, where linger only hideous and polluting recollections of\r\n      vice; and time brings us on to the brink of the grave, and dissolution\r\n      flings us in\u2014a rag eaten through and through with disease, wrung\r\n      together with pain, stamped into the churchyard sod by the inexorable heel\r\n      of despair.\r\n    \n\r\n      But the man of regular life and rational mind never despairs. He loses his\r\n      property\u2014it is a blow\u2014he staggers a moment; then, his\r\n      energies, roused by the smart, are at work to seek a remedy; activity soon\r\n      mitigates regret. Sickness affects him; he takes patience\u2014endures\r\n      what he cannot cure. Acute pain racks him; his writhing limbs know not\r\n      where to find rest; he leans on Hope\u2019s anchors. Death takes from him what\r\n      he loves; roots up, and tears violently away the stem round which his\r\n      affections were twined\u2014a dark, dismal time, a frightful wrench\u2014but\r\n      some morning Religion looks into his desolate house with sunrise, and\r\n      says, that in another world, another life, he shall meet his kindred\r\n      again. She speaks of that world as a place unsullied by sin\u2014of that\r\n      life, as an era unembittered by suffering; she mightily strengthens her\r\n      consolation by connecting with it two ideas\u2014which mortals cannot\r\n      comprehend, but on which they love to repose\u2014Eternity, Immortality;\r\n      and the mind of the mourner, being filled with an image, faint yet\r\n      glorious, of heavenly hills all light and peace\u2014of a spirit resting\r\n      there in bliss\u2014of a day when his spirit shall also alight there,\r\n      free and disembodied\u2014of a reunion perfected by love, purified from\r\n      fear\u2014he takes courage\u2014goes out to encounter the necessities\r\n      and discharge the duties of life; and, though sadness may never lift her\r\n      burden from his mind, Hope will enable him to support it.\r\n    \n\r\n      Well\u2014and what suggested all this? and what is the inference to be\r\n      drawn therefrom? What suggested it, is the circumstance of my best\r\n      pupil\u2014my treasure\u2014being snatched from my hands, and put away out of my\r\n      reach; the inference to be drawn from it is\u2014that, being a steady,\r\n      reasonable man, I did not allow the resentment, disappointment, and grief,\r\n      engendered in my mind by this evil chance, to grow there to any monstrous\r\n      size; nor did I allow them to monopolize the whole space of my heart; I\r\n      pent them, on the contrary, in one strait and secret nook. In the daytime,\r\n      too, when I was about my duties, I put them on the silent system; and it\r\n      was only after I had closed the door of my chamber at night that I\r\n      somewhat relaxed my severity towards these morose nurslings, and allowed\r\n      vent to their language of murmurs; then, in revenge, they sat on my\r\n      pillow, haunted my bed, and kept me awake with their long, midnight cry.\r\n    \n\r\n      A week passed. I had said nothing more to Mdlle. Reuter. I had been calm\r\n      in my demeanour to her, though stony cold and hard. When I looked at her,\r\n      it was with the glance fitting to be bestowed on one who I knew had\r\n      consulted jealousy as an adviser, and employed treachery as an\r\n      instrument\u2014the glance of quiet disdain and rooted distrust. On Saturday\r\n      evening, ere I left the house, I stept into the\r\n      salle-\u00e0-manger, where she was sitting alone, and, placing\r\n      myself before her, I asked, with the same tranquil tone and manner that I\r\n      should have used had I put the question for the first time\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, will you have the goodness to give me the address of\r\n      Frances Evans Henri?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      A little surprised, but not disconcerted, she smilingly disclaimed any\r\n      knowledge of that address, adding, \u201cMonsieur has perhaps forgotten that I\r\n      explained all about that circumstance before\u2014a week ago?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d I continued, \u201cyou would greatly oblige me by directing me\r\n      to that young person\u2019s abode.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She seemed somewhat puzzled; and, at last, looking up with an admirably\r\n      counterfeited air of naivete, she demanded, \u201cDoes Monsieur think I am\r\n      telling an untruth?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Still avoiding to give her a direct answer, I said, \u201cIt is not then your\r\n      intention, mademoiselle, to oblige me in this particular?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut, monsieur, how can I tell you what I do not know?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery well; I understand you perfectly, mademoiselle, and now I have only\r\n      two or three words to say. This is the last week in July; in another month\r\n      the vacation will commence, have the goodness to avail yourself of the\r\n      leisure it will afford you to look out for another English master\u2014at\r\n      the close of August, I shall be under the necessity of resigning my post\r\n      in your establishment.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I did not wait for her comments on this announcement, but bowed and\r\n      immediately withdrew.\r\n    \n\r\n      That same evening, soon after dinner, a servant brought me a small packet;\r\n      it was directed in a hand I knew, but had not hoped so soon to see again;\r\n      being in my own apartment and alone, there was nothing to prevent my\r\n      immediately opening it; it contained four five-franc pieces, and a note in\r\n      English.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMONSIEUR,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI came to Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s house yesterday, at the time when I knew you\r\n      would be just about finishing your lesson, and I asked if I might go into\r\n      the schoolroom and speak to you. Mdlle. Reuter came out and said you were\r\n      already gone; it had not yet struck four, so I thought she must be\r\n      mistaken, but concluded it would be vain to call another day on the same\r\n      errand. In one sense a note will do as well\u2014it will wrap up the 20\r\n      francs, the price of the lessons I have received from you; and if it will\r\n      not fully express the thanks I owe you in addition\u2014if it will not\r\n      bid you good-bye as I could wish to have done\u2014if it will not tell\r\n      you, as I long to do, how sorry I am that I shall probably never see you\r\n      more\u2014why, spoken words would hardly be more adequate to the task.\r\n      Had I seen you, I should probably have stammered out something feeble and\r\n      unsatisfactory\u2014something belying my feelings rather than explaining\r\n      them; so it is perhaps as well that I was denied admission to your\r\n      presence. You often remarked, monsieur, that my devoirs dwelt a great deal\r\n      on fortitude in bearing grief\u2014you said I introduced that theme too\r\n      often: I find indeed that it is much easier to write about a severe duty\r\n      than to perform it, for I am oppressed when I see and feel to what a\r\n      reverse fate has condemned me; you were kind to me, monsieur\u2014very\r\n      kind; I am afflicted\u2014I am heart-broken to be quite separated from\r\n      you; soon I shall have no friend on earth. But it is useless troubling you\r\n      with my distresses. What claim have I on your sympathy? None; I will then\r\n      say no more.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFarewell, Monsieur.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cF. E. HENRI.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I put up the note in my pocket-book. I slipped the five-franc pieces into\r\n      my purse\u2014then I took a turn through my narrow chamber.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMdlle. Reuter talked about her poverty,\u201d said I, \u201cand she is poor; yet\r\n      she pays her debts and more. I have not yet given her a quarter\u2019s lessons,\r\n      and she has sent me a quarter\u2019s due. I wonder of what she deprived herself\r\n      to scrape together the twenty francs\u2014I wonder what sort of a place\r\n      she has to live in, and what sort of a woman her aunt is, and whether she\r\n      is likely to get employment to supply the place she has lost. No doubt she\r\n      will have to trudge about long enough from school to school, to inquire\r\n      here, and apply there\u2014be rejected in this place, disappointed in\r\n      that. Many an evening she\u2019ll go to her bed tired and unsuccessful. And the\r\n      directress would not let her in to bid me good-bye? I might not have the\r\n      chance of standing with her for a few minutes at a window in the\r\n      schoolroom and exchanging some half-dozen of sentences\u2014getting to\r\n      know where she lived\u2014putting matters in train for having all things\r\n      arranged to my mind? No address on the note\u201d\u2014I continued, drawing it\r\n      again from the pocket-book and examining it on each side of the two\r\n      leaves: \u201cwomen are women, that is certain, and always do business like\r\n      women; men mechanically put a date and address to their communications.\r\n      And these five-franc pieces?\u201d\u2014(I hauled them forth from my purse)\u2014\u201cif\r\n      she had offered me them herself instead of tying them up with a thread of\r\n      green silk in a kind of Lilliputian packet, I could have thrust them back\r\n      into her little hand, and shut up the small, taper fingers over\r\n      them\u2014so\u2014and compelled her shame, her pride, her shyness, all to yield to a\r\n      little bit of determined Will\u2014now where is she? How can I get at her?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Opening my chamber door I walked down into the kitchen.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWho brought the packet?\u201d I asked of the servant who had delivered it to\r\n      me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cUn petit commissionaire, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDid he say anything?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cRien.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And I wended my way up the back-stairs, wondrously the wiser for my\r\n      inquiries.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo matter,\u201d said I to myself, as I again closed the door. \u201cNo matter\u2014I\u2019ll\r\n      seek her through Brussels.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And I did. I sought her day by day whenever I had a moment\u2019s leisure, for\r\n      four weeks; I sought her on Sundays all day long; I sought her on the\r\n      Boulevards, in the All\u00e9e Verte, in the Park; I sought her in Ste. Gudule\r\n      and St. Jacques; I sought her in the two Protestant chapels; I attended\r\n      these latter at the German, French, and English services, not doubting\r\n      that I should meet her at one of them. All my researches were absolutely\r\n      fruitless; my security on the last point was proved by the event to be\r\n      equally groundless with my other calculations. I stood at the door of each\r\n      chapel after the service, and waited till every individual had come out,\r\n      scrutinizing every gown draping a slender form, peering under every bonnet\r\n      covering a young head. In vain; I saw girlish figures pass me, drawing\r\n      their black scarfs over their sloping shoulders, but none of them had the\r\n      exact turn and air of Mdlle. Henri\u2019s; I saw pale and thoughtful faces\r\n      \u201cencadrees\u201d in bands of brown hair, but I never found her forehead, her\r\n      eyes, her eyebrows. All the features of all the faces I met seemed\r\n      frittered away, because my eye failed to recognize the peculiarities it\r\n      was bent upon; an ample space of brow and a large, dark, and serious eye,\r\n      with a fine but decided line of eyebrow traced above.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cShe has probably left Brussels\u2014perhaps is gone to England, as she\r\n      said she would,\u201d muttered I inwardly, as on the afternoon of the fourth\r\n      Sunday, I turned from the door of the chapel-royal which the door-keeper\r\n      had just closed and locked, and followed in the wake of the last of the\r\n      congregation, now dispersed and dispersing over the square. I had soon\r\n      outwalked the couples of English gentlemen and ladies. (Gracious goodness!\r\n      why don\u2019t they dress better? My eye is yet filled with visions of the\r\n      high-flounced, slovenly, and tumbled dresses in costly silk and satin, of\r\n      the large unbecoming collars in expensive lace; of the ill-cut coats and\r\n      strangely fashioned pantaloons which every Sunday, at the English service,\r\n      filled the choirs of the chapel-royal, and after it, issuing forth into\r\n      the square, came into disadvantageous contrast with freshly and trimly\r\n      attired foreign figures, hastening to attend salut at the church of\r\n      Coburg.) I had passed these pairs of Britons, and the groups of pretty\r\n      British children, and the British footmen and waiting-maids; I had crossed\r\n      the Place Royale, and got into the Rue Royale, thence I had diverged into\r\n      the Rue de Louvain\u2014an old and quiet street. I remember that, feeling\r\n      a little hungry, and not desiring to go back and take my share of the\r\n      \u201cgo\u00fbter,\u201d now on the refectory-table at Pelet\u2019s\u2014to wit, pistolets\r\n      and water\u2014I stepped into a baker\u2019s and refreshed myself on a\r\n      couc (?)\u2014it is a Flemish word, I don\u2019t know how to spell\r\n      it\u2014\u00e0 Corinthe\u2014Anglice,\r\n      a currant bun\u2014and a cup of coffee; and then I strolled on towards\r\n      the Porte de Louvain. Very soon I was out of the city, and slowly mounting\r\n      the hill, which ascends from the gate, I took my time; for the afternoon,\r\n      though cloudy, was very sultry, and not a breeze stirred to refresh the\r\n      atmosphere. No inhabitant of Brussels need wander far to search for\r\n      solitude; let him but move half a league from his own city and he will\r\n      find her brooding still and blank over the wide fields, so drear though so\r\n      fertile, spread out treeless and trackless round the capital of Brabant.\r\n      Having gained the summit of the hill, and having stood and looked long\r\n      over the cultured but lifeless campaign, I felt a wish to quit the high\r\n      road, which I had hitherto followed, and get in among those tilled\r\n      grounds\u2014fertile as the beds of a Brobdignagian kitchen-garden\u2014spreading\r\n      far and wide even to the boundaries of the horizon, where, from a dusk\r\n      green, distance changed them to a sullen blue, and confused their tints\r\n      with those of the livid and thunderous-looking sky.\r\n      Accordingly I turned up a by-path to the\r\n      right; I had not followed it far ere it brought me, as I expected, into\r\n      the fields, amidst which, just before me, stretched a long and lofty white\r\n      wall enclosing, as it seemed from the foliage showing above, some thickly\r\n      planted nursery of yew and cypress, for of that species were the branches\r\n      resting on the pale parapets, and crowding gloomily about a massive cross,\r\n      planted doubtless on a central eminence and extending its arms, which\r\n      seemed of black marble, over the summits of those sinister trees. I\r\n      approached, wondering to what house this well-protected garden\r\n      appertained; I turned the angle of the wall, thinking to see some stately\r\n      residence; I was close upon great iron gates; there was a hut serving for\r\n      a lodge near, but I had no occasion to apply for the key\u2014the gates\r\n      were open; I pushed one leaf back\u2014rain had rusted its hinges, for it\r\n      groaned dolefully as they revolved. Thick planting embowered the entrance.\r\n      Passing up the avenue, I saw objects on each hand which, in their own mute\r\n      language of inscription and sign, explained clearly to what abode I had\r\n      made my way. This was the house appointed for all living; crosses,\r\n      monuments, and garlands of everlastings announced, \u201cThe Protestant\r\n      Cemetery, outside the gate of Louvain.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The place was large enough to afford half an hour\u2019s strolling without the\r\n      monotony of treading continually the same path; and, for those who love to\r\n      peruse the annals of graveyards, here was variety of inscription enough to\r\n      occupy the attention for double or treble that space of time. Hither\r\n      people of many kindreds, tongues, and nations, had brought their dead for\r\n      interment; and here, on pages of stone, of marble, and of brass, were\r\n      written names, dates, last tributes of pomp or love, in English, in\r\n      French, in German, and Latin. Here the Englishman had erected a marble\r\n      monument over the remains of his Mary Smith or Jane Brown, and inscribed\r\n      it only with her name. There the French widower had shaded the grave of\r\n      his Elmire or Celestine with a brilliant thicket of roses, amidst which a\r\n      little tablet rising, bore an equally bright testimony to her countless\r\n      virtues. Every nation, tribe, and kindred, mourned after its own fashion;\r\n      and how soundless was the mourning of all! My own tread, though slow and\r\n      upon smooth-rolled paths, seemed to startle, because it formed the sole\r\n      break to a silence otherwise total. Not only the winds, but the very\r\n      fitful, wandering airs, were that afternoon, as by common consent, all\r\n      fallen asleep in their various quarters; the north was hushed, the south\r\n      silent, the east sobbed not, nor did the west whisper. The clouds in\r\n      heaven were condensed and dull, but apparently quite motionless. Under the\r\n      trees of this cemetery nestled a warm breathless gloom, out of which the\r\n      cypresses stood up straight and mute, above which the willows hung low and\r\n      still; where the flowers, as languid as fair, waited listless for night\r\n      dew or thunder-shower; where the tombs, and those they hid, lay impassible\r\n      to sun or shadow, to rain or drought.\r\n    \n\r\n      Importuned by the sound of my own footsteps, I turned off upon the turf,\r\n      and slowly advanced to a grove of yews; I saw something stir among the\r\n      stems; I thought it might be a broken branch swinging, my short-sighted\r\n      vision had caught no form, only a sense of motion; but the dusky shade\r\n      passed on, appearing and disappearing at the openings in the avenue. I\r\n      soon discerned it was a living thing, and a human thing; and, drawing\r\n      nearer, I perceived it was a woman, pacing slowly to and fro, and\r\n      evidently deeming herself alone as I had deemed myself alone, and\r\n      meditating as I had been meditating. Ere long she returned to a seat which\r\n      I fancy she had but just quitted, or I should have caught sight of her\r\n      before. It was in a nook, screened by a clump of trees; there was the\r\n      white wall before her, and a little stone set up against the wall, and, at\r\n      the foot of the stone, was an allotment of turf freshly turned up, a\r\n      new-made grave. I put on my spectacles, and passed softly close behind\r\n      her; glancing at the inscription on the stone, I read, \u201cJulienne Henri,\r\n      died at Brussels, aged sixty. August 10th, 18\u2014.\u201d Having perused the\r\n      inscription, I looked down at the form sitting bent and thoughtful just\r\n      under my eyes, unconscious of the vicinity of any living thing; it was a\r\n      slim, youthful figure in mourning apparel of the plainest black stuff,\r\n      with a little simple, black crape bonnet; I felt, as well as saw, who it\r\n      was; and, moving neither hand nor foot, I stood some moments enjoying the\r\n      security of conviction. I had sought her for a month, and had never\r\n      discovered one of her traces\u2014never met a hope, or seized a chance of\r\n      encountering her anywhere. I had been forced to loosen my grasp on\r\n      expectation; and, but an hour ago, had sunk slackly under the discouraging\r\n      thought that the current of life, and the impulse of destiny, had swept\r\n      her for ever from my reach; and, behold, while bending suddenly earthward\r\n      beneath the pressure of despondency\u2014while following with my eyes the\r\n      track of sorrow on the turf of a graveyard\u2014here was my lost jewel\r\n      dropped on the tear-fed herbage, nestling in the messy and mouldy roots of\r\n      yew-trees.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances sat very quiet, her elbow on her knee, and her head on her hand. I\r\n      knew she could retain a thinking attitude a long time without change; at\r\n      last, a tear fell; she had been looking at the name on the stone before\r\n      her, and her heart had no doubt endured one of those constrictions with\r\n      which the desolate living, regretting the dead, are, at times, so sorely\r\n      oppressed. Many tears rolled down, which she wiped away, again and again,\r\n      with her handkerchief; some distressed sobs escaped her, and then, the\r\n      paroxysm over, she sat quiet as before. I put my hand gently on her\r\n      shoulder; no need further to prepare her, for she was neither hysterical\r\n      nor liable to fainting-fits; a sudden push, indeed, might have startled\r\n      her, but the contact of my quiet touch merely woke attention as I wished;\r\n      and, though she turned quickly, yet so lightning-swift is thought\u2014in\r\n      some minds especially\u2014I believe the wonder of what\u2014the\r\n      consciousness of who it was that thus stole unawares on her solitude, had\r\n      passed through her brain, and flashed into her heart, even before she had\r\n      effected that hasty movement; at least, Amazement had hardly opened her\r\n      eyes and raised them to mine, ere Recognition informed their irids with\r\n      most speaking brightness. Nervous surprise had hardly discomposed her\r\n      features ere a sentiment of most vivid joy shone clear and warm on her\r\n      whole countenance. I had hardly time to observe that she was wasted and\r\n      pale, ere called to feel a responsive inward pleasure by the sense of most\r\n      full and exquisite pleasure glowing in the animated flush, and shining in\r\n      the expansive light, now diffused over my pupil\u2019s face. It was the summer\r\n      sun flashing out after the heavy summer shower; and what fertilizes more\r\n      rapidly than that beam, burning almost like fire in its ardour?\r\n    \n\r\n      I hate boldness\u2014that boldness which is of the brassy brow and\r\n      insensate nerves; but I love the courage of the strong heart, the fervour\r\n      of the generous blood; I loved with passion the light of Frances Evans\u2019\r\n      clear hazel eye when it did not fear to look straight into mine; I loved\r\n      the tones with which she uttered the words\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMon ma\u00eetre! mon ma\u00eetre!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I loved the movement with which she confided her hand to my hand; I loved\r\n      her as she stood there, penniless and parentless; for a sensualist\r\n      charmless, for me a treasure\u2014my best object of sympathy on earth,\r\n      thinking such thoughts as I thought, feeling such feelings as I felt; my\r\n      ideal of the shrine in which to seal my stores of love; personification of\r\n      discretion and forethought, of diligence and perseverance, of self-denial\r\n      and self-control\u2014those guardians, those trusty keepers of the gift I\r\n      longed to confer on her\u2014the gift of all my affections; model of\r\n      truth and honour, of independence and conscientiousness\u2014those\r\n      refiners and sustainers of an honest life; silent possessor of a well of\r\n      tenderness, of a flame, as genial as still, as pure as quenchless, of\r\n      natural feeling, natural passion\u2014those sources of refreshment and\r\n      comfort to the sanctuary of home. I knew how quietly and how deeply the\r\n      well bubbled in her heart; I knew how the more dangerous flame burned\r\n      safely under the eye of reason; I had seen when the fire shot up a moment\r\n      high and vivid, when the accelerated heat troubled life\u2019s current in its\r\n      channels; I had seen reason reduce the rebel, and humble its blaze to\r\n      embers. I had confidence in Frances Evans; I had respect for her, and as I\r\n      drew her arm through mine, and led her out of the cemetery, I felt I had\r\n      another sentiment, as strong as confidence, as firm as respect, more\r\n      fervid than either\u2014that of love.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, my pupil,\u201d said I, as the ominous sounding gate swung to behind\r\n      us\u2014\u201cWell, I have found you again: a month\u2019s search has seemed long, and I\r\n      little thought to have discovered my lost sheep straying amongst graves.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Never had I addressed her but as \u201cMademoiselle\u201d before, and to speak thus\r\n      was to take up a tone new to both her and me. Her answer suprised me that\r\n      this language ruffled none of her feelings, woke no discord in her heart:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMon ma\u00eetre,\u201d she said, \u201chave you troubled yourself to seek me? I little\r\n      imagined you would think much of my absence, but I grieved bitterly to be\r\n      taken away from you. I was sorry for that circumstance when heavier\r\n      troubles ought to have made me forget it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour aunt is dead?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, a fortnight since, and she died full of regret, which I could not\r\n      chase from her mind; she kept repeating, even during the last night of her\r\n      existence, \u2018Frances, you will be so lonely when I am gone, so friendless:\u2019\r\n      she wished too that she could have been buried in Switzerland, and it was\r\n      I who persuaded her in her old age to leave the banks of Lake Leman, and\r\n      to come, only as it seems to die, in this flat region of Flanders.\r\n      Willingly would I have observed her last wish, and taken her remains back\r\n      to our own country, but that was impossible; I was forced to lay her\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cShe was ill but a short time, I presume?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut three weeks. When she began to sink I asked Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s leave to\r\n      stay with her and wait on her; I readily got leave.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDo you return to the pensionnat!\u201d I demanded hastily.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, when I had been at home a week Mdlle. Reuter called one\r\n      evening, just after I had got my aunt to bed; she went into her room to\r\n      speak to her, and was extremely civil and affable, as she always is;\r\n      afterwards she came and sat with me a long time, and just as she rose to\r\n      go away, she said: \u201cMademoiselle, I shall not soon cease to regret your\r\n      departure from my establishment, though indeed it is true that you have\r\n      taught your class of pupils so well that they are all quite accomplished\r\n      in the little works you manage so skilfully, and have not the slightest\r\n      need of further instruction; my second teacher must in future supply your\r\n      place, with regard to the younger pupils, as well as she can, though she\r\n      is indeed an inferior artiste to you, and doubtless it will be your part\r\n      now to assume a higher position in your calling; I am sure you will\r\n      everywhere find schools and families willing to profit by your talents.\u2019\r\n      And then she paid me my last quarter\u2019s salary. I asked, as mademoiselle\r\n      would no doubt think, very bluntly, if she designed to discharge me from\r\n      the establishment. She smiled at my inelegance of speech, and answered\r\n      that \u2018our connection as employer and employed was certainly dissolved, but\r\n      that she hoped still to retain the pleasure of my acquaintance; she should\r\n      always be happy to see me as a friend;\u2019 and then she said something about\r\n      the excellent condition of the streets, and the long continuance of fine\r\n      weather, and went away quite cheerful.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I laughed inwardly; all this was so like the directress\u2014so like what\r\n      I had expected and guessed of her conduct; and then the exposure and proof\r\n      of her lie, unconsciously afforded by Frances:\u2014\u201cShe had frequently\r\n      applied for Mdlle. Henri\u2019s address,\u201d forsooth; \u201cMdlle. Henri had always\r\n      evaded giving it,\u201d &c., &c., and here I found her a visitor at the\r\n      very house of whose locality she had professed absolute ignorance!\r\n    \n\r\n      Any comments I might have intended to make on my pupil\u2019s communication,\r\n      were checked by the plashing of large rain-drops on our faces and on the\r\n      path, and by the muttering of a distant but coming storm. The warning\r\n      obvious in stagnant air and leaden sky had already induced me to take the\r\n      road leading back to Brussels, and now I hastened my own steps and those\r\n      of my companion, and, as our way lay downhill, we got on rapidly. There\r\n      was an interval after the fall of the first broad drops before heavy rain\r\n      came on; in the meantime we had passed through the Porte de Louvain, and\r\n      were again in the city.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d I asked; \u201cI will see you safe home.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cRue Notre Dame aux Neiges,\u201d answered Frances.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was not far from the Rue de Louvain, and we stood on the doorsteps of\r\n      the house we sought ere the clouds, severing with loud peal and shattered\r\n      cataract of lightning, emptied their livid folds in a torrent, heavy,\r\n      prone, and broad.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCome in! come in!\u201d said Frances, as, after putting her into the house, I\r\n      paused ere I followed: the word decided me; I stepped across the\r\n      threshold, shut the door on the rushing, flashing, whitening storm, and\r\n      followed her upstairs to her apartments. Neither she nor I were wet; a\r\n      projection over the door had warded off the straight-descending flood;\r\n      none but the first, large drops had touched our garments; one minute more\r\n      and we should not have had a dry thread on us.\r\n    \n\r\n      Stepping over a little mat of green wool, I found myself in a small room\r\n      with a painted floor and a square of green carpet in the middle; the\r\n      articles of furniture were few, but all bright and exquisitely clean;\r\n      order reigned through its narrow limits\u2014such order as it soothed my\r\n      punctilious soul to behold. And I had hesitated to enter the abode,\r\n      because I apprehended after all that Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s hint about its\r\n      extreme poverty might be too well-founded, and I feared to embarrass the\r\n      lace-mender by entering her lodgings unawares! Poor the place might be;\r\n      poor truly it was; but its neatness was better than elegance, and had but\r\n      a bright little fire shone on that clean hearth, I should have deemed it\r\n      more attractive than a palace. No fire was there, however, and no fuel\r\n      laid ready to light; the lace-mender was unable to allow herself that\r\n      indulgence, especially now when, deprived by death of her sole relative,\r\n      she had only her own unaided exertions to rely on. Frances went into an\r\n      inner room to take off her bonnet, and she came out a model of frugal\r\n      neatness, with her well-fitting black stuff dress, so accurately defining\r\n      her elegant bust and taper waist, with her spotless white collar turned\r\n      back from a fair and shapely neck, with her plenteous brown hair arranged\r\n      in smooth bands on her temples, and in a large Grecian plait behind:\r\n      ornaments she had none\u2014neither brooch, ring, nor ribbon; she did\r\n      well enough without them\u2014perfection of fit, proportion of form,\r\n      grace of carriage, agreeably supplied their place. Her eye, as she\r\n      re-entered the small sitting-room, instantly sought mine, which was just\r\n      then lingering on the hearth; I knew she read at once the sort of inward\r\n      ruth and pitying pain which the chill vacancy of that hearth stirred in my\r\n      soul: quick to penetrate, quick to determine, and quicker to put in\r\n      practice, she had in a moment tied a holland apron round her waist; then\r\n      she disappeared, and reappeared with a basket; it had a cover; she opened\r\n      it, and produced wood and coal; deftly and compactly she arranged them in\r\n      the grate.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIt is her whole stock, and she will exhaust it out of hospitality,\u201d\r\n       thought I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked: \u201cnot surely to light a fire this hot\r\n      evening? I shall be smothered.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIndeed, monsieur, I feel it very chilly since the rain began; besides, I\r\n      must boil the water for my tea, for I take tea on Sundays; you will be\r\n      obliged to try and bear the heat.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She had struck a light; the wood was already in a blaze; and truly, when\r\n      contrasted with the darkness, the wild tumult of the tempest without, that\r\n      peaceful glow which began to beam on the now animated hearth, seemed very\r\n      cheering. A low, purring sound, from some quarter, announced that another\r\n      being, besides myself, was pleased with the change; a black cat, roused by\r\n      the light from its sleep on a little cushioned foot-stool, came and rubbed\r\n      its head against Frances\u2019 gown as she knelt; she caressed it, saying it\r\n      had been a favourite with her \u201cpauvre tante Julienne.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The fire being lit, the hearth swept, and a small kettle of a very antique\r\n      pattern, such as I thought I remembered to have seen in old farmhouses in\r\n      England, placed over the now ruddy flame, Frances\u2019 hands were washed, and\r\n      her apron removed in an instant; then she opened a cupboard, and took out\r\n      a tea-tray, on which she had soon arranged a china tea-equipage, whose\r\n      pattern, shape, and size, denoted a remote antiquity; a little,\r\n      old-fashioned silver spoon was deposited in each saucer; and a pair of\r\n      silver tongs, equally old-fashioned, were laid on the sugar-basin; from\r\n      the cupboard, too, was produced a tidy silver cream-ewer, not larger then\r\n      an egg-shell. While making these preparations, she chanced to look up,\r\n      and, reading curiosity in my eyes, she smiled and asked\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIs this like England, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cLike the England of a hundred years ago,\u201d I replied.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIs it truly? Well, everything on this tray is at least a hundred years\r\n      old: these cups, these spoons, this ewer, are all heirlooms; my\r\n      great-grandmother left them to my grandmother, she to my mother, and my\r\n      mother brought them with her from England to Switzerland, and left them to\r\n      me; and, ever since I was a little girl, I have thought I should like to\r\n      carry them back to England, whence they came.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She put some pistolets on the table; she made the tea, as foreigners do\r\n      make tea\u2014i.e., at the rate of a teaspoonful to half-a-dozen cups;\r\n      she placed me a chair, and, as I took it, she asked, with a sort of\r\n      exaltation\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWill it make you think yourself at home for a moment?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIf I had a home in England, I believe it would recall it,\u201d I answered;\r\n      and, in truth, there was a sort of illusion in seeing the\r\n      fair-complexioned English-looking girl presiding at the English meal, and\r\n      speaking in the English language.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have then no home?\u201d was her remark.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNone, nor ever have had. If ever I possess a home, it must be of my own\r\n      making, and the task is yet to begin.\u201d And, as I spoke, a pang, new to me,\r\n      shot across my heart: it was a pang of mortification at the humility of my\r\n      position, and the inadequacy of my means; while with that pang was born a\r\n      strong desire to do more, earn more, be more, possess more; and in the\r\n      increased possessions, my roused and eager spirit panted to include the\r\n      home I had never had, the wife I inwardly vowed to win.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances\u2019 tea was little better than hot water, sugar, and milk; and her\r\n      pistolets, with which she could not offer me butter, were sweet to my\r\n      palate as manna.\r\n    \n\r\n      The repast over, and the treasured plate and porcelain being washed and\r\n      put by, the bright table rubbed still brighter, \u201cle chat de ma tante\r\n      Julienne\u201d also being fed with provisions brought forth on a plate for its\r\n      special use, a few stray cinders, and a scattering of ashes too, being\r\n      swept from the hearth, Frances at last sat down; and then, as she took a\r\n      chair opposite to me, she betrayed, for the first time, a little\r\n      embarrassment; and no wonder, for indeed I had unconsciously watched her\r\n      rather too closely, followed all her steps and all her movements a little\r\n      too perseveringly with my eyes, for she mesmerized me by the grace and\r\n      alertness of her action\u2014by the deft, cleanly, and even decorative\r\n      effect resulting from each touch of her slight and fine fingers; and when,\r\n      at last, she subsided to stillness, the intelligence of her face seemed\r\n      beauty to me, and I dwelt on it accordingly. Her colour, however, rising,\r\n      rather than settling with repose, and her eyes remaining downcast, though\r\n      I kept waiting for the lids to be raised that I might drink a ray of the\r\n      light I loved\u2014a light where fire dissolved in softness, where\r\n      affection tempered penetration, where, just now at least, pleasure played\r\n      with thought\u2014this expectation not being gratified, I began at last\r\n      to suspect that I had probably myself to blame for the disappointment; I\r\n      must cease gazing, and begin talking, if I wished to break the spell under\r\n      which she now sat motionless; so recollecting the composing effect which\r\n      an authoritative tone and manner had ever been wont to produce on her, I\r\n      said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGet one of your English books, mademoiselle, for the rain yet falls\r\n      heavily, and will probably detain me half an hour longer.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Released, and set at ease, up she rose, got her book, and accepted at once\r\n      the chair I placed for her at my side. She had selected \u201cParadise Lost\u201d\r\n       from her shelf of classics, thinking, I suppose, the religious character\r\n      of the book best adapted it to Sunday; I told her to begin at the\r\n      beginning, and while she read Milton\u2019s invocation to that heavenly muse,\r\n      who on the \u201csecret top of Oreb or Sinai\u201d had taught the Hebrew shepherd\r\n      how in the womb of chaos, the conception of a world had originated and\r\n      ripened, I enjoyed, undisturbed, the treble pleasure of having her near\r\n      me, hearing the sound of her voice\u2014a sound sweet and satisfying in\r\n      my ear\u2014and looking, by intervals, at her face: of this last\r\n      privilege, I chiefly availed myself when I found fault with an intonation,\r\n      a pause, or an emphasis; as long as I dogmatized, I might also gaze,\r\n      without exciting too warm a flush.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEnough,\u201d said I, when she had gone through some half dozen pages (a work\r\n      of time with her, for she read slowly and paused often to ask and receive\r\n      information)\u2014\u201cenough; and now the rain is ceasing, and I must soon\r\n      go.\u201d For indeed, at that moment, looking towards the window, I saw it all\r\n      blue; the thunder-clouds were broken and scattered, and the setting August\r\n      sun sent a gleam like the reflection of rubies through the lattice. I got\r\n      up; I drew on my gloves.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have not yet found another situation to supply the place of that from\r\n      which you were dismissed by Mdlle. Reuter?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur; I have made inquiries everywhere, but they all ask me for\r\n      references; and to speak truth, I do not like to apply to the directress,\r\n      because I consider she acted neither justly nor honourably towards me; she\r\n      used underhand means to set my pupils against me, and thereby render me\r\n      unhappy while I held my place in her establishment, and she eventually\r\n      deprived me of it by a masked and hypocritical manoeuvre, pretending that\r\n      she was acting for my good, but really snatching from me my chief means of\r\n      subsistence, at a crisis when not only my own life, but that of another,\r\n      depended on my exertions: of her I will never more ask a favour.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHow, then, do you propose to get on? How do you live now?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI have still my lace-mending trade; with care it will keep me from\r\n      starvation, and I doubt not by dint of exertion to get better employment\r\n      yet; it is only a fortnight since I began to try; my courage or hopes are\r\n      by no means worn out yet.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd if you get what you wish, what then? what are your ultimate views?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTo save enough to cross the Channel: I always look to England as my\r\n      Canaan.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, well\u2014ere long I shall pay you another visit; good evening\r\n      now,\u201d and I left her rather abruptly; I had much ado to resist a strong\r\n      inward impulse, urging me to take a warmer, more expressive leave: what so\r\n      natural as to fold her for a moment in a close embrace, to imprint one\r\n      kiss on her cheek or forehead? I was not unreasonable\u2014that was all I\r\n      wanted; satisfied in that point, I could go away content; and Reason\r\n      denied me even this; she ordered me to turn my eyes from her face, and my\r\n      steps from her apartment\u2014to quit her as dryly and coldly as I would\r\n      have quitted old Madame Pelet. I obeyed, but I swore rancorously to be\r\n      avenged one day. \u201cI\u2019ll earn a right to do as I please in this matter, or\r\n      I\u2019ll die in the contest. I have one object before me now\u2014to get that\r\n      Genevese girl for my wife; and my wife she shall be\u2014that is,\r\n      provided she has as much, or half as much regard for her master as he has\r\n      for her. And would she be so docile, so smiling, so happy under my\r\n      instructions if she had not? would she sit at my side when I dictate or\r\n      correct, with such a still, contented, halcyon mien?\u201d for I had ever\r\n      remarked, that however sad or harassed her countenance might be when I\r\n      entered a room, yet after I had been near her, spoken to her a few words,\r\n      given her some directions, uttered perhaps some reproofs, she would, all\r\n      at once, nestle into a nook of happiness, and look up serene and revived.\r\n      The reproofs suited her best of all: while I scolded she would chip away\r\n      with her pen-knife at a pencil or a pen; fidgetting a little, pouting a\r\n      little, defending herself by monosyllables, and when I deprived her of the\r\n      pen or pencil, fearing it would be all cut away, and when I interdicted\r\n      even the monosyllabic defence, for the purpose of working up the subdued\r\n      excitement a little higher, she would at last raise her eyes and give me a\r\n      certain glance, sweetened with gaiety, and pointed with defiance, which,\r\n      to speak truth, thrilled me as nothing had ever done, and made me, in a\r\n      fashion (though happily she did not know it), her subject, if not her\r\n      slave. After such little scenes her spirits would maintain their flow,\r\n      often for some hours, and, as I remarked before, her health therefrom took\r\n      a sustenance and vigour which, previously to the event of her aunt\u2019s death\r\n      and her dismissal, had almost recreated her whole frame.\r\n    \n\r\n      It has taken me several minutes to write these last sentences; but I had\r\n      thought all their purport during the brief interval of descending the\r\n      stairs from Frances\u2019 room. Just as I was opening the outer door, I\r\n      remembered the twenty francs which I had not restored; I paused:\r\n      impossible to carry them away with me; difficult to force them back on\r\n      their original owner; I had now seen her in her own humble abode,\r\n      witnessed the dignity of her poverty, the pride of order, the fastidious\r\n      care of conservatism, obvious in the arrangement and economy of her little\r\n      home; I was sure she would not suffer herself to be excused paying her\r\n      debts; I was certain the favour of indemnity would be accepted from no\r\n      hand, perhaps least of all from mine: yet these four five-franc pieces\r\n      were a burden to my self-respect, and I must get rid of them. An\r\n      expedient\u2014a clumsy one no doubt, but the best I could devise\u2014suggested\r\n      itself to me. I darted up the stairs, knocked, re-entered the room as if\r\n      in haste:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, I have forgotten one of my gloves; I must have left it\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She instantly rose to seek it; as she turned her back, I\u2014being now\r\n      at the hearth\u2014noiselessly lifted a little vase, one of a set of\r\n      china ornaments, as old-fashioned as the tea-cups\u2014slipped the money\r\n      under it, then saying\u2014\u201cOh here is my glove! I had dropped it within\r\n      the fender; good evening, mademoiselle,\u201d I made my second exit.\r\n    \n\r\n      Brief as my impromptu return had been, it had afforded me time to pick up\r\n      a heart-ache; I remarked that Frances had already removed the red embers\r\n      of her cheerful little fire from the grate: forced to calculate every\r\n      item, to save in every detail, she had instantly on my departure\r\n      retrenched a luxury too expensive to be enjoyed alone.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI am glad it is not yet winter,\u201d thought I; \u201cbut in two months more come\r\n      the winds and rains of November; would to God that before then I could\r\n      earn the right, and the power, to shovel coals into that grate\r\n      ad libitum!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Already the pavement was drying; a balmy and fresh breeze stirred the air,\r\n      purified by lightning; I felt the West behind me, where spread a sky like\r\n      opal; azure immingled with crimson: the enlarged sun, glorious in Tyrian\r\n      tints, dipped his brim already; stepping, as I was, eastward, I faced a\r\n      vast bank of clouds, but also I had before me the arch of an evening\r\n      rainbow; a perfect rainbow\u2014high, wide, vivid. I looked long; my eye\r\n      drank in the scene, and I suppose my brain must have absorbed it; for that\r\n      night, after lying awake in pleasant fever a long time, watching the\r\n      silent sheet-lightning, which still played among the retreating clouds,\r\n      and flashed silvery over the stars, I at last fell asleep; and then in a\r\n      dream were reproduced the setting sun, the bank of clouds, the mighty\r\n      rainbow. I stood, methought, on a terrace; I leaned over a parapeted wall;\r\n      there was space below me, depth I could not fathom, but hearing an endless\r\n      dash of waves, I believed it to be the sea; sea spread to the horizon; sea\r\n      of changeful green and intense blue: all was soft in the distance; all\r\n      vapour-veiled. A spark of gold glistened on the line between water and\r\n      air, floated up, approached, enlarged, changed; the object hung midway\r\n      between heaven and earth, under the arch of the rainbow; the soft but dusk\r\n      clouds diffused behind. It hovered as on wings; pearly, fleecy, gleaming\r\n      air streamed like raiment round it; light, tinted with carnation, coloured\r\n      what seemed face and limbs; a large star shone with still lustre on an\r\n      angel\u2019s forehead; an upraised arm and hand, glancing like a ray, pointed\r\n      to the bow overhead, and a voice in my heart whispered\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHope smiles on Effort!\u201d\r\n     \n"}
{"20": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XX.\r\n    \n\r\n      A COMPETENCY was what I wanted; a competency it was now my aim and resolve\r\n      to secure; but never had I been farther from the mark. With August the\r\n      school-year (l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire) closed, the examinations concluded, the\r\n      prizes were adjudged, the schools dispersed, the gates of all colleges,\r\n      the doors of all pensionnats shut, not to be reopened till the beginning\r\n      or middle of October. The last day of August was at hand, and what was my\r\n      position? Had I advanced a step since the commencement of the past\r\n      quarter? On the contrary, I had receded one. By renouncing my engagement\r\n      as English master in Mdlle. Reuter\u2019s establishment, I had voluntarily cut\r\n      off \u00a320 from my yearly income; I had diminished my \u00a360 per annum to\r\n      \u00a340, and even that sum I now held by a very precarious tenure.\r\n    \n\r\n      It is some time since I made any reference to M. Pelet. The moonlight walk\r\n      is, I think, the last incident recorded in this narrative where that\r\n      gentleman cuts any conspicuous figure: the fact is, since that event, a\r\n      change had come over the spirit of our intercourse. He, indeed, ignorant\r\n      that the still hour, a cloudless moon, and an open lattice, had revealed\r\n      to me the secret of his selfish love and false friendship, would have\r\n      continued smooth and complaisant as ever; but I grew spiny as a porcupine,\r\n      and inflexible as a blackthorn cudgel; I never had a smile for his\r\n      raillery, never a moment for his society; his invitations to take coffee\r\n      with him in his parlour were invariably rejected, and very stiffly and\r\n      sternly rejected too; his jesting allusions to the directress (which he\r\n      still continued) were heard with a grim calm very different from the\r\n      petulant pleasure they were formerly wont to excite. For a long time Pelet\r\n      bore with my frigid demeanour very patiently; he even increased his\r\n      attentions; but finding that even a cringing politeness failed to thaw or\r\n      move me, he at last altered too; in his turn he cooled; his invitations\r\n      ceased; his countenance became suspicious and overcast, and I read in the\r\n      perplexed yet brooding aspect of his brow, a constant examination and\r\n      comparison of premises, and an anxious endeavour to draw thence some\r\n      explanatory inference. Ere long, I fancy, he succeeded, for he was not\r\n      without penetration; perhaps, too, Mdlle. Zora\u00efde might have aided him in\r\n      the solution of the enigma; at any rate I soon found that the uncertainty\r\n      of doubt had vanished from his manner; renouncing all pretence of\r\n      friendship and cordiality, he adopted a reserved, formal, but still\r\n      scrupulously polite deportment. This was the point to which I had wished\r\n      to bring him, and I was now again comparatively at my ease. I did not, it\r\n      is true, like my position in his house; but being freed from the annoyance\r\n      of false professions and double-dealing I could endure it, especially as\r\n      no heroic sentiment of hatred or jealousy of the director distracted my\r\n      philosophical soul; he had not, I found, wounded me in a very tender\r\n      point, the wound was so soon and so radically healed, leaving only a sense\r\n      of contempt for the treacherous fashion in which it had been inflicted,\r\n      and a lasting mistrust of the hand which I had detected attempting to stab\r\n      in the dark.\r\n    \n\r\n      This state of things continued till about the middle of July, and then\r\n      there was a little change; Pelet came home one night, an hour after his\r\n      usual time, in a state of unequivocal intoxication, a thing anomalous with\r\n      him; for if he had some of the worst faults of his countrymen, he had also\r\n      one at least of their virtues, i.e. sobriety. So drunk, however, was he\r\n      upon this occasion, that after having roused the whole establishment\r\n      (except the pupils, whose dormitory being over the classes in a building\r\n      apart from the dwelling-house, was consequently out of the reach of\r\n      disturbance) by violently ringing the hall-bell and ordering lunch to be\r\n      brought in immediately, for he imagined it was noon, whereas the city\r\n      bells had just tolled midnight; after having furiously rated the servants\r\n      for their want of punctuality, and gone near to chastise his poor old\r\n      mother, who advised him to go to bed, he began raving dreadfully about \u201cle\r\n      maudit Anglais, Creemsvort.\u201d I had not yet retired; some German books I\r\n      had got hold of had kept me up late; I heard the uproar below, and could\r\n      distinguish the director\u2019s voice exalted in a manner as appalling as it\r\n      was unusual. Opening my door a little, I became aware of a demand on his\r\n      part for \u201cCreemsvort\u201d to be brought down to him that he might cut his\r\n      throat on the hall-table and wash his honour, which he affirmed to be in a\r\n      dirty condition, in infernal British blood. \u201cHe is either mad or drunk,\u201d\r\n       thought I, \u201cand in either case the old woman and the servants will be the\r\n      better of a man\u2019s assistance,\u201d so I descended straight to the hall. I\r\n      found him staggering about, his eyes in a fine frenzy rolling\u2014a\r\n      pretty sight he was, a just medium between the fool and the lunatic.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCome, M. Pelet,\u201d said I, \u201cyou had better go to bed,\u201d and I took hold of\r\n      his arm. His excitement, of course, increased greatly at sight and touch\r\n      of the individual for whose blood he had been making application: he\r\n      struggled and struck with fury\u2014but a drunken man is no match for a\r\n      sober one; and, even in his normal state, Pelet\u2019s worn out frame could not\r\n      have stood against my sound one. I got him up-stairs, and, in process of\r\n      time, to bed. During the operation he did not fail to utter comminations\r\n      which, though broken, had a sense in them; while stigmatizing me as the\r\n      treacherous spawn of a perfidious country, he, in the same breath,\r\n      anathematized Zora\u00efde Reuter; he termed her \u201cfemme sotte et vicieuse,\u201d\r\n       who, in a fit of lewd caprice, had thrown herself away on an unprincipled\r\n      adventurer; directing the point of the last appellation by a furious blow,\r\n      obliquely aimed at me. I left him in the act of bounding elastically out\r\n      of the bed into which I had tucked him; but, as I took the precaution of\r\n      turning the key in the door behind me, I retired to my own room, assured\r\n      of his safe custody till the morning, and free to draw undisturbed\r\n      conclusions from the scene I had just witnessed.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now, it was precisely about this time that the directress, stung by my\r\n      coldness, bewitched by my scorn, and excited by the preference she\r\n      suspected me of cherishing for another, had fallen into a snare of her own\r\n      laying\u2014was herself caught in the meshes of the very passion with\r\n      which she wished to entangle me. Conscious of the state of things in that\r\n      quarter, I gathered, from the condition in which I saw my employer, that\r\n      his lady-love had betrayed the alienation of her affections\u2014inclinations,\r\n      rather, I would say; affection is a word at once too warm and too pure for\r\n      the subject\u2014had let him see that the cavity of her hollow heart,\r\n      emptied of his image, was now occupied by that of his usher. It was not\r\n      without some surprise that I found myself obliged to entertain this view\r\n      of the case; Pelet, with his old-established school, was so convenient, so\r\n      profitable a match\u2014Zora\u00efde was so calculating, so interested a woman\u2014I\r\n      wondered mere personal preference could, in her mind, have prevailed for a\r\n      moment over worldly advantage: yet, it was evident, from what Pelet said,\r\n      that, not only had she repulsed him, but had even let slip expressions of\r\n      partiality for me. One of his drunken exclamations was, \u201cAnd the jade\r\n      doats on your youth, you raw blockhead! and talks of your noble\r\n      deportment, as she calls your accursed English formality\u2014and your\r\n      pure morals, forsooth! des moeurs de Caton a-t-elle dit\u2014sotte!\u201d\r\n       Hers, I thought, must be a curious soul, where in spite of a strong,\r\n      natural tendency to estimate unduly advantages of wealth and station, the\r\n      sardonic disdain of a fortuneless subordinate had wrought a deeper\r\n      impression than could be imprinted by the most flattering assiduities of a\r\n      prosperous chef d\u2019institution. I smiled inwardly; and\r\n      strange to say, though my amour propre was excited not\r\n      disagreeably by the conquest, my\r\n      better feelings remained untouched. Next day, when I saw the directress,\r\n      and when she made an excuse to meet me in the corridor, and besought my\r\n      notice by a demeanour and look subdued to Helot humility, I could not\r\n      love, I could scarcely pity her. To answer briefly and dryly some\r\n      interesting inquiry about my health\u2014to pass her by with a stern bow\u2014was\r\n      all I could; her presence and manner had then, and for some time\r\n      previously and consequently, a singular effect upon me: they sealed up all\r\n      that was good, elicited all that was noxious in my nature; sometimes they\r\n      enervated my senses, but they always hardened my heart. I was aware of the\r\n      detriment done, and quarrelled with myself for the change. I had ever\r\n      hated a tyrant; and, behold, the possession of a slave, self-given, went\r\n      near to transform me into what I abhorred! There was at once a sort of low\r\n      gratification in receiving this luscious incense from an attractive and\r\n      still young worshipper; and an irritating sense of degradation in the very\r\n      experience of the pleasure. When she stole about me with the soft step of\r\n      a slave, I felt at once barbarous and sensual as a pasha. I endured her\r\n      homage sometimes; sometimes I rebuked it. My indifference or harshness\r\n      served equally to increase the evil I desired to check.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cQue le d\u00e9dain lui sied bien!\u201d I once overheard her say to her mother: \u201cil\r\n      est beau comme Apollon quand il sourit de son air hautain.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      And the jolly old dame laughed, and said she thought her daughter was\r\n      bewitched, for I had no point of a handsome man about me, except being\r\n      straight and without deformity. \u201cPour moi,\u201d she continued, \u201cil me fait\r\n      tout l\u2019effet d\u2019un chat-huant, avec ses b\u00e9sicles.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Worthy old girl! I could have gone and kissed her had she not been a\r\n      little too old, too fat, and too red-faced; her sensible, truthful words\r\n      seemed so wholesome, contrasted with the morbid illusions of her daughter.\r\n    \n\r\n      When Pelet awoke on the morning after his frenzy fit, he retained no\r\n      recollection of what had happened the previous night, and his mother\r\n      fortunately had the discretion to refrain from informing him that I had\r\n      been a witness of his degradation. He did not again have recourse to wine\r\n      for curing his griefs, but even in his sober mood he soon showed that the\r\n      iron of jealousy had entered into his soul. A thorough Frenchman, the\r\n      national characteristic of ferocity had not been omitted by nature in\r\n      compounding the ingredients of his character; it had appeared first in his\r\n      access of drunken wrath, when some of his demonstrations of hatred to my\r\n      person were of a truly fiendish character, and now it was more covertly\r\n      betrayed by momentary contractions of the features, and flashes of\r\n      fierceness in his light blue eyes, when their glance chanced to encounter\r\n      mine. He absolutely avoided speaking to me; I was now spared even the\r\n      falsehood of his politeness. In this state of our mutual relations, my\r\n      soul rebelled sometimes almost ungovernably, against living in the house\r\n      and discharging the service of such a man; but who is free from the\r\n      constraint of circumstances? At that time, I was not: I used to rise each\r\n      morning eager to shake off his yoke, and go out with my portmanteau under\r\n      my arm, if a beggar, at least a freeman; and in the evening, when I came\r\n      back from the pensionnat de demoiselles, a certain pleasant voice in my\r\n      ear; a certain face, so intelligent, yet so docile, so reflective, yet so\r\n      soft, in my eyes; a certain cast of character, at once proud and pliant,\r\n      sensitive and sagacious, serious and ardent, in my head; a certain tone of\r\n      feeling, fervid and modest, refined and practical, pure and powerful,\r\n      delighting and troubling my memory\u2014visions of new ties I longed to\r\n      contract, of new duties I longed to undertake, had taken the rover and the\r\n      rebel out of me, and had shown endurance of my hated lot in the light of a\r\n      Spartan virtue.\r\n    \n\r\n      But Pelet\u2019s fury subsided; a fortnight sufficed for its rise, progress,\r\n      and extinction: in that space of time the dismissal of the obnoxious\r\n      teacher had been effected in the neighbouring house, and in the same\r\n      interval I had declared my resolution to follow and find out my pupil, and\r\n      upon my application for her address being refused, I had summarily\r\n      resigned my own post. This last act seemed at once to restore Mdlle.\r\n      Reuter to her senses; her sagacity, her judgment, so long misled by a\r\n      fascinating delusion, struck again into the right track the moment that\r\n      delusion vanished. By the right track, I do not mean the steep and\r\n      difficult path of principle\u2014in that path she never trod; but the\r\n      plain highway of common sense, from which she had of late widely diverged.\r\n      When there she carefully sought, and having found, industriously pursued\r\n      the trail of her old suitor, M. Pelet. She soon overtook him. What arts\r\n      she employed to soothe and blind him I know not, but she succeeded both in\r\n      allaying his wrath, and hoodwinking his discernment, as was soon proved by\r\n      the alteration in his mien and manner; she must have managed to convince\r\n      him that I neither was, nor ever had been, a rival of his, for the\r\n      fortnight of fury against me terminated in a fit of exceeding graciousness\r\n      and amenity, not unmixed with a dash of exulting self-complacency, more\r\n      ludicrous than irritating. Pelet\u2019s bachelor\u2019s life had been passed in\r\n      proper French style with due disregard to moral restraint, and I thought\r\n      his married life promised to be very French also. He often boasted to me\r\n      what a terror he had been to certain husbands of his acquaintance; I\r\n      perceived it would not now be difficult to pay him back in his own coin.\r\n    \n\r\n      The crisis drew on. No sooner had the holidays commenced than note of\r\n      preparation for some momentous event sounded all through the premises of\r\n      Pelet: painters, polishers, and upholsterers were immediately set to work,\r\n      and there was talk of \u201cla chambre de Madame,\u201d \u201cle salon de Madame.\u201d Not\r\n      deeming it probable that the old duenna at present graced with that title\r\n      in our house, had inspired her son with such enthusiasm of filial piety,\r\n      as to induce him to fit up apartments expressly for her use, I concluded,\r\n      in common with the cook, the two housemaids, and the kitchen-scullion,\r\n      that a new and more juvenile Madame was destined to be the tenant of these\r\n      gay chambers.\r\n    \n\r\n      Presently official announcement of the coming event was put forth. In\r\n      another week\u2019s time M. Fran\u00e7ois Pelet, directeur, and Mdlle. Zora\u00efde\r\n      Reuter, directrice, were to be joined together in the bands of matrimony.\r\n      Monsieur, in person, heralded the fact to me; terminating his\r\n      communication by an obliging expression of his desire that I should\r\n      continue, as heretofore, his ablest assistant and most trusted friend; and\r\n      a proposition to raise my salary by an additional two hundred francs per\r\n      annum. I thanked him, gave no conclusive answer at the time, and, when he\r\n      had left me, threw off my blouse, put on my coat, and set out on a long\r\n      walk outside the Porte de Flandre, in order, as I thought, to cool my\r\n      blood, calm my nerves, and shake my disarranged ideas into some order. In\r\n      fact, I had just received what was virtually my dismissal. I could not\r\n      conceal, I did not desire to conceal from myself the conviction that,\r\n      being now certain that Mdlle. Reuter was destined to become Madame Pelet\r\n      it would not do for me to remain a dependent dweller in the house which\r\n      was soon to be hers. Her present demeanour towards me was deficient\r\n      neither in dignity nor propriety; but I knew her former feeling was\r\n      unchanged. Decorum now repressed, and Policy masked it, but Opportunity\r\n      would be too strong for either of these\u2014Temptation would shiver\r\n      their restraints.\r\n    \n\r\n      I was no pope\u2014I could not boast infallibility: in short, if I\r\n      stayed, the probability was that, in three months\u2019 time, a practical\r\n      modern French novel would be in full process of concoction under the roof\r\n      of the unsuspecting Pelet. Now, modern French novels are not to my taste,\r\n      either practically or theoretically. Limited as had yet been my experience\r\n      of life, I had once had the opportunity of contemplating, near at hand, an\r\n      example of the results produced by a course of interesting and romantic\r\n      domestic treachery. No golden halo of fiction was about this example, I\r\n      saw it bare and real, and it was very loathsome. I saw a mind degraded by\r\n      the practice of mean subterfuge, by the habit of perfidious deception, and\r\n      a body depraved by the infectious influence of the vice-polluted soul. I\r\n      had suffered much from the forced and prolonged view of this spectacle;\r\n      those sufferings I did not now regret, for their simple recollection acted\r\n      as a most wholesome antidote to temptation. They had inscribed on my\r\n      reason the conviction that unlawful pleasure, trenching on another\u2019s\r\n      rights, is delusive and envenomed pleasure\u2014its hollowness\r\n      disappoints at the time, its poison cruelly tortures afterwards, its\r\n      effects deprave for ever.\r\n    \n\r\n      From all this resulted the conclusion that I must leave Pelet\u2019s, and that\r\n      instantly; \u201cbut,\u201d said Prudence, \u201cyou know not where to go, nor how to\r\n      live;\u201d and then the dream of true love came over me: Frances Henri seemed\r\n      to stand at my side; her slender waist to invite my arm; her hand to court\r\n      my hand; I felt it was made to nestle in mine; I could not relinquish my\r\n      right to it, nor could I withdraw my eyes for ever from hers, where I saw\r\n      so much happiness, such a correspondence of heart with heart; over whose\r\n      expression I had such influence; where I could kindle bliss, infuse awe,\r\n      stir deep delight, rouse sparkling spirit, and sometimes waken pleasurable\r\n      dread. My hopes to will and possess, my resolutions to merit and rise,\r\n      rose in array against me; and here I was about to plunge into the gulf of\r\n      absolute destitution; \u201cand all this,\u201d suggested an inward voice, \u201cbecause\r\n      you fear an evil which may never happen!\u201d \u201cIt will happen; you\r\n      know it will,\u201d answered that stubborn monitor, Conscience. \u201cDo\r\n      what you feel is right; obey me, and even in the sloughs of want I will\r\n      plant for you firm footing.\u201d And then, as I walked fast along the road,\r\n      there rose upon me a strange, inly-felt idea of some Great Being, unseen,\r\n      but all present, who in His beneficence desired only my welfare, and now\r\n      watched the struggle of good and evil in my heart, and waited to see\r\n      whether I should obey His voice, heard in the whispers of my conscience,\r\n      or lend an ear to the sophisms by which His enemy and mine\u2014the Spirit of\r\n      Evil\u2014sought to lead me astray.\r\n      Rough and steep was the path indicated by divine\r\n      suggestion; mossy and declining the green way along which Temptation\r\n      strewed flowers; but whereas, methought, the Deity of Love, the Friend of\r\n      all that exists, would smile well-pleased were I to gird up my loins and\r\n      address myself to the rude ascent; so, on the other hand, each inclination\r\n      to the velvet declivity seemed to kindle a gleam of triumph on the brow of\r\n      the man-hating, God-defying demon. Sharp and short I turned round; fast I\r\n      retraced my steps; in half an hour I was again at M. Pelet\u2019s: I sought him\r\n      in his study; brief parley, concise explanation sufficed; my manner proved\r\n      that I was resolved; he, perhaps, at heart approved my decision. After\r\n      twenty minutes\u2019 conversation, I re-entered my own room, self-deprived of\r\n      the means of living, self-sentenced to leave my present home, with the\r\n      short notice of a week in which to provide another.\r\n    \n"}
{"21": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXI.\r\n    \n\r\n      DIRECTLY as I closed the door, I saw laid on the table two letters; my\r\n      thought was, that they were notes of invitation from the friends of some\r\n      of my pupils; I had received such marks of attention occasionally, and\r\n      with me, who had no friends, correspondence of more interest was out of\r\n      the question; the postman\u2019s arrival had never yet been an event of\r\n      interest to me since I came to Brussels. I laid my hand carelessly on the\r\n      documents, and coldly and slowly glancing at them, I prepared to break the\r\n      seals; my eye was arrested and my hand too; I saw what excited me, as if I\r\n      had found a vivid picture where I expected only to discover a blank page:\r\n      on one cover was an English postmark; on the other, a lady\u2019s clear, fine\r\n      autograph; the last I opened first:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMONSIEUR,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI found out what you had done the very morning after your visit to me;\r\n      you might be sure I should dust the china, every day; and, as no one but\r\n      you had been in my room for a week, and as fairy-money is not current in\r\n      Brussels, I could not doubt who left the twenty francs on the\r\n      chimney-piece. I thought I heard you stir the vase when I was stooping to\r\n      look for your glove under the table, and I wondered you should imagine it\r\n      had got into such a little cup. Now, monsieur, the money is not mine, and\r\n      I shall not keep it; I will not send it in this note because it might be\r\n      lost\u2014besides, it is heavy; but I will restore it to you the first\r\n      time I see you, and you must make no difficulties about taking it;\r\n      because, in the first place, I am sure, monsieur, you can understand that\r\n      one likes to pay one\u2019s debts; that it is satisfactory to owe no man\r\n      anything; and, in the second place, I can now very well afford to be\r\n      honest, as I am provided with a situation. This last circumstance is,\r\n      indeed, the reason of my writing to you, for it is pleasant to communicate\r\n      good news; and, in these days, I have only my master to whom I can tell\r\n      anything.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA week ago, monsieur, I was sent for by a Mrs. Wharton, an English lady;\r\n      her eldest daughter was going to be married, and some rich relation having\r\n      made her a present of a veil and dress in costly old lace, as precious,\r\n      they said, almost as jewels, but a little damaged by time, I was\r\n      commissioned to put them in repair. I had to do it at the house; they gave\r\n      me, besides, some embroidery to complete, and nearly a week elapsed before\r\n      I had finished everything. While I worked, Miss Wharton often came into\r\n      the room and sat with me, and so did Mrs. Wharton; they made me talk\r\n      English; asked how I had learned to speak it so well; then they inquired\r\n      what I knew besides\u2014what books I had read; soon they seemed to make\r\n      a sort of wonder of me, considering me no doubt as a learned grisette. One\r\n      afternoon, Mrs. Wharton brought in a Parisian lady to test the accuracy of\r\n      my knowledge of French; the result of it was that, owing probably in a\r\n      great degree to the mother\u2019s and daughter\u2019s good humour about the\r\n      marriage, which inclined them to do beneficent deeds, and partly, I think,\r\n      because they are naturally benevolent people, they decided that the wish I\r\n      had expressed to do something more than mend lace was a very legitimate\r\n      one; and the same day they took me in their carriage to Mrs. D.\u2018s, who is\r\n      the directress of the first English school at Brussels. It seems she\r\n      happened to be in want of a French lady to give lessons in geography,\r\n      history, grammar, and composition, in the French language. Mrs. Wharton\r\n      recommended me very warmly; and, as two of her younger daughters are\r\n      pupils in the house, her patronage availed to get me the place. It was\r\n      settled that I am to attend six hours daily (for, happily, it was not\r\n      required that I should live in the house; I should have been sorry to\r\n      leave my lodgings), and, for this, Mrs. D. will give me twelve hundred\r\n      francs per annum.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou see, therefore, monsieur, that I am now rich; richer almost than I\r\n      ever hoped to be: I feel thankful for it, especially as my sight was\r\n      beginning to be injured by constant working at fine lace; and I was\r\n      getting, too, very weary of sitting up late at nights, and yet not being\r\n      able to find time for reading or study. I began to fear that I should fall\r\n      ill, and be unable to pay my way; this fear is now, in a great measure,\r\n      removed; and, in truth, monsieur, I am very grateful to God for the\r\n      relief; and I feel it necessary, almost, to speak of my happiness to some\r\n      one who is kind-hearted enough to derive joy from seeing others joyful. I\r\n      could not, therefore, resist the temptation of writing to you; I argued\r\n      with myself it is very pleasant for me to write, and it will not be\r\n      exactly painful, though it may be tiresome to monsieur to read. Do not be\r\n      too angry with my circumlocution and inelegancies of expression, and,\r\n      believe me\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYour attached pupil,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cF. E. HENRI.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Having read this letter, I mused on its contents for a few moments\u2014whether\r\n      with sentiments pleasurable or otherwise I will hereafter note\u2014and\r\n      then took up the other. It was directed in a hand to me unknown\u2014small,\r\n      and rather neat; neither masculine nor exactly feminine; the seal bore a\r\n      coat of arms, concerning which I could only decipher that it was not that\r\n      of the Seacombe family, consequently the epistle could be from none of my\r\n      almost forgotten, and certainly quite forgetting patrician relations. From\r\n      whom, then, was it? I removed the envelope; the note folded within ran as\r\n      follows:\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt in the world that you are doing well in that greasy\r\n      Flanders; living probably on the fat of the unctuous land; sitting like a\r\n      black-haired, tawny-skinned, long-nosed Israelite by the flesh-pots of\r\n      Egypt; or like a rascally son of Levi near the brass cauldrons of the\r\n      sanctuary, and every now and then plunging in a consecrated hook, and\r\n      drawing out of the sea of broth the fattest of heave-shoulders and the\r\n      fleshiest of wave-breasts. I know this, because you never write to any one\r\n      in England. Thankless dog that you are! I, by the sovereign efficacy of my\r\n      recommendation, got you the place where you are now living in clover, and\r\n      yet not a word of gratitude, or even acknowledgment, have you ever offered\r\n      in return; but I am coming to see you, and small conception can you, with\r\n      your addled aristocratic brains, form of the sort of moral kicking I have,\r\n      ready packed in my carpet-bag, destined to be presented to you immediately\r\n      on my arrival.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMeantime I know all about your affairs, and have just got information, by\r\n      Brown\u2019s last letter, that you are said to be on the point of forming an\r\n      advantageous match with a pursy, little Belgian schoolmistress\u2014a\r\n      Mdlle. Z\u00e9nobie, or some such name. Won\u2019t I have a look at her when I come\r\n      over! And this you may rely on: if she pleases my taste, or if I think it\r\n      worth while in a pecuniary point of view, I\u2019ll pounce on your prize and\r\n      bear her away triumphant in spite of your teeth. Yet I don\u2019t like dumpies\r\n      either, and Brown says she is little and stout\u2014the better fitted for\r\n      a wiry, starved-looking chap like you. \u201cBe on the look-out, for you know\r\n      neither the day nor hour when your \u2014\u2014\u201d (I don\u2019t wish to\r\n      blaspheme, so I\u2019ll leave a blank)\u2014cometh.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYours truly,\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHUNSDEN YORKE HUNSDEN.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHumph!\u201d said I; and ere I laid the letter down, I again glanced at the\r\n      small, neat handwriting, not a bit like that of a mercantile man, nor,\r\n      indeed, of any man except Hunsden himself. They talk of affinities between\r\n      the autograph and the character: what affinity was there here? I recalled\r\n      the writer\u2019s peculiar face and certain traits I suspected, rather than\r\n      knew, to appertain to his nature, and I answered, \u201cA great deal.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden, then, was coming to Brussels, and coming I knew not when; coming\r\n      charged with the expectation of finding me on the summit of prosperity,\r\n      about to be married, to step into a warm nest, to lie comfortably down by\r\n      the side of a snug, well-fed little mate.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI wish him joy of the fidelity of the picture he has painted,\u201d thought I.\r\n      \u201cWhat will he say when, instead of a pair of plump turtle doves, billing\r\n      and cooing in a bower of roses, he finds a single lean cormorant, standing\r\n      mateless and shelterless on poverty\u2019s bleak cliff? Oh, confound him! Let\r\n      him come, and let him laugh at the contrast between rumour and fact. Were\r\n      he the devil himself, instead of being merely very like him, I\u2019d not\r\n      condescend to get out of his way, or to forge a smile or a cheerful word\r\n      wherewith to avert his sarcasm.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Then I recurred to the other letter: that struck a chord whose sound I\r\n      could not deaden by thrusting my fingers into my ears, for it vibrated\r\n      within; and though its swell might be exquisite music, its cadence was a\r\n      groan.\r\n    \n\r\n      That Frances was relieved from the pressure of want, that the curse of\r\n      excessive labour was taken off her, filled me with happiness; that her\r\n      first thought in prosperity should be to augment her joy by sharing it\r\n      with me, met and satisfied the wish of my heart. Two results of her letter\r\n      were then pleasant, sweet as two draughts of nectar; but applying my lips\r\n      for the third time to the cup, and they were excoriated as with vinegar\r\n      and gall.\r\n    \n\r\n      Two persons whose desires are moderate may live well enough in Brussels on\r\n      an income which would scarcely afford a respectable maintenance for one in\r\n      London: and that, not because the necessaries of life are so much dearer\r\n      in the latter capital, or taxes so much higher than in the former, but\r\n      because the English surpass in folly all the nations on God\u2019s earth, and\r\n      are more abject slaves to custom, to opinion, to the desire to keep up a\r\n      certain appearance, than the Italians are to priestcraft, the French to\r\n      vain-glory, the Russians to their Czar, or the Germans to black beer. I\r\n      have seen a degree of sense in the modest arrangement of one homely\r\n      Belgian household, that might put to shame the elegance, the\r\n      superfluities, the luxuries, the strained refinements of a hundred genteel\r\n      English mansions. In Belgium, provided you can make money, you may save\r\n      it; this is scarcely possible in England; ostentation there lavishes in a\r\n      month what industry has earned in a year. More shame to all classes in\r\n      that most bountiful and beggarly country for their servile following of\r\n      Fashion; I could write a chapter or two on this subject, but must forbear,\r\n      at least for the present. Had I retained my \u00a360 per annum I could, now\r\n      that Frances was in possession of \u00a350, have gone straight to her this\r\n      very evening, and spoken out the words which, repressed, kept fretting my\r\n      heart with fever; our united income would, as we should have managed it,\r\n      have sufficed well for our mutual support; since we lived in a country\r\n      where economy was not confounded with meanness, where frugality in dress,\r\n      food, and furniture, was not synonymous with vulgarity in these various\r\n      points. But the placeless usher, bare of resource, and unsupported by\r\n      connections, must not think of this; such a sentiment as love, such a word\r\n      as marriage, were misplaced in his heart, and on his lips. Now for the\r\n      first time did I truly feel what it was to be poor; now did the sacrifice\r\n      I had made in casting from me the means of living put on a new aspect;\r\n      instead of a correct, just, honourable act, it seemed a deed at once light\r\n      and fanatical; I took several turns in my room, under the goading\r\n      influence of most poignant remorse; I walked a quarter of an hour from the\r\n      wall to the window; and at the window, self-reproach seemed to face me; at\r\n      the wall, self-disdain: all at once out spoke Conscience:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDown, stupid tormenters!\u201d cried she; \u201cthe man has done his duty; you\r\n      shall not bait him thus by thoughts of what might have been; he\r\n      relinquished a temporary and contingent good to avoid a permanent and\r\n      certain evil; he did well. Let him reflect now, and when your blinding\r\n      dust and deafening hum subside, he will discover a path.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I sat down; I propped my forehead on both my hands; I thought and thought\r\n      an hour\u2014two hours; vainly. I seemed like one sealed in a subterranean\r\n      vault, who gazes at utter blackness; at blackness ensured by yard-thick\r\n      stone walls around, and by piles of building above, expecting light to\r\n      penetrate through granite, and through cement firm as granite. But there\r\n      are chinks, or there may be chinks, in the best adjusted masonry; there\r\n      was a chink in my cavernous cell; for, eventually, I saw, or seemed to\r\n      see, a ray\u2014pallid, indeed, and cold, and doubtful, but still a ray,\r\n      for it showed that narrow path which conscience had promised after two,\r\n      three hours\u2019 torturing research in brain and memory, I disinterred certain\r\n      remains of circumstances, and conceived a hope that by putting them\r\n      together an expedient might be framed, and a resource discovered. The\r\n      circumstances were briefly these:\r\n    \n\r\n      Some three months ago M. Pelet had, on the occasion of his\r\n      f\u00eate, given the\r\n      boys a treat, which treat consisted in a party of pleasure to a certain\r\n      place of public resort in the outskirts of Brussels, of which I do not at\r\n      this moment remember the name, but near it were several of those lakelets\r\n      called \u00e9tangs; and there was one \u00e9tang, larger than the rest, where on\r\n      holidays people were accustomed to amuse themselves by rowing round it in\r\n      little boats. The boys having eaten an unlimited quantity of \u201cgaufres,\u201d\r\n      and drank several bottles of Louvain beer, amid the shades of a garden\r\n      made and provided for such crams, petitioned the director for leave to\r\n      take a row on the \u00e9tang. Half a dozen of the eldest succeeded in obtaining\r\n      leave, and I was commissioned to accompany them as surveillant. Among the\r\n      half dozen happened to be a certain Jean Baptiste Vandenhuten, a most\r\n      ponderous young Flamand, not tall, but even now, at the early age of\r\n      sixteen, possessing a breadth and depth of personal development truly\r\n      national. It chanced that Jean was the first lad to step into the boat; he\r\n      stumbled, rolled to one side, the boat revolted at his weight and\r\n      capsized. Vandenhuten sank like lead, rose, sank again. My coat and\r\n      waistcoat were off in an instant; I had not been brought up at Eton and\r\n      boated and bathed and swam there ten long years for nothing; it was a\r\n      natural and easy act for me to leap to the rescue. The lads and the\r\n      boatmen yelled; they thought there would be two deaths by drowning instead\r\n      of one; but as Jean rose the third time, I clutched him by one leg and the\r\n      collar, and in three minutes more both he and I were safe landed. To speak\r\n      heaven\u2019s truth, my merit in the action was small indeed, for I had run no\r\n      risk, and subsequently did not even catch cold from the wetting; but when\r\n      M. and Madame Vandenhuten, of whom Jean Baptiste was the sole hope, came\r\n      to hear of the exploit, they seemed to think I had evinced a bravery and\r\n      devotion which no thanks could sufficiently repay. Madame, in particular,\r\n      was \u201ccertain I must have dearly loved their sweet son, or I would not thus\r\n      have hazarded my own life to save his.\u201d Monsieur, an honest-looking,\r\n      though phlegmatic man, said very little, but he would not suffer me to\r\n      leave the room, till I had promised that in case I ever stood in need of\r\n      help I would, by applying to him, give him a chance of discharging the\r\n      obligation under which he affirmed I had laid him. These words, then, were\r\n      my glimmer of light; it was here I found my sole outlet; and in truth,\r\n      though the cold light roused, it did not cheer me; nor did the outlet seem\r\n      such as I should like to pass through. Right I had none to M.\r\n      Vandenhuten\u2019s good offices; it was not on the ground of merit I could\r\n      apply to him; no, I must stand on that of necessity: I had no work; I\r\n      wanted work; my best chance of obtaining it lay in securing his\r\n      recommendation. This I knew could be had by asking for it; not to ask,\r\n      because the request revolted my pride and contradicted my habits, would, I\r\n      felt, be an indulgence of false and indolent fastidiousness. I might\r\n      repent the omission all my life; I would not then be guilty of it.\r\n    \n\r\n      That evening I went to M. Vandenhuten\u2019s; but I had bent the bow and\r\n      adjusted the shaft in vain; the string broke. I rang the bell at the great\r\n      door (it was a large, handsome house in an expensive part of the town); a\r\n      manservant opened; I asked for M. Vandenhuten; M. Vandenhuten and family\r\n      were all out of town\u2014gone to Ostend\u2014did not know when they\r\n      would be back. I left my card, and retraced my steps.\r\n    \n"}
{"22": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXII\r\n    \n\r\n      A WEEK is gone; le jour des noces arrived; the marriage\r\n      was solemnized at St. Jacques; Mdlle. Zora\u00efde became Madame Pelet,\r\n      n\u00e9e Reuter; and, in about\r\n      an hour after this transformation, \u201cthe happy pair,\u201d as newspapers phrase\r\n      it, were on their way to Paris; where, according to previous arrangement,\r\n      the honeymoon was to be spent. The next day I quitted the pensionnat.\r\n      Myself and my chattels (some books and clothes) were soon transferred to a\r\n      modest lodging I had hired in a street not far off. In half an hour my\r\n      clothes were arranged in a commode, my books on a shelf, and the\r\n      \u201cflitting\u201d was effected. I should not have been unhappy that day had not\r\n      one pang tortured me\u2014a longing to go to the Rue Notre Dame aux\r\n      Neiges, resisted, yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid that street\r\n      till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my prospects.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was a sweet September evening\u2014very mild, very still; I had\r\n      nothing to do; at that hour I knew Frances would be equally released from\r\n      occupation; I thought she might possibly be wishing for her master, I knew\r\n      I wished for my pupil. Imagination began with her low whispers, infusing\r\n      into my soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou will find her reading or writing,\u201d said she; \u201cyou can take your seat\r\n      at her side; you need not startle her peace by undue excitement; you need\r\n      not embarrass her manner by unusual action or language. Be as you always\r\n      are; look over what she has written; listen while she reads; chide her, or\r\n      quietly approve; you know the effect of either system; you know her smile\r\n      when pleased, you know the play of her looks when roused; you have the\r\n      secret of awakening what expression you will, and you can choose amongst\r\n      that pleasant variety. With you she will sit silent as long as it suits\r\n      you to talk alone; you can hold her under a potent spell: intelligent as\r\n      she is, eloquent as she can be, you can seal her lips, and veil her bright\r\n      countenance with diffidence; yet, you know, she is not all monotonous\r\n      mildness; you have seen, with a sort of strange pleasure, revolt, scorn,\r\n      austerity, bitterness, lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and\r\n      physiognomy; you know that few could rule her as you do; you know she\r\n      might break, but never bend under the hand of Tyranny and Injustice, but\r\n      Reason and Affection can guide her by a sign. Try their influence now.\r\n      Go\u2014they are not passions; you may handle them safely.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI will not go,\u201d was my answer to the sweet temptress. A man is\r\n      master of himself to a certain point, but not beyond it. Could I seek\r\n      Frances to-night, could I sit with her alone in a quiet room, and address\r\n      her only in the language of Reason and Affection?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d was the brief, fervent reply of that Love which had conquered and\r\n      now controlled me.\r\n    \n\r\n      Time seemed to stagnate; the sun would not go down; my watch ticked, but I\r\n      thought the hands were paralyzed.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat a hot evening!\u201d I cried, throwing open the lattice; for, indeed, I\r\n      had seldom felt so feverish. Hearing a step ascending the common stair, I\r\n      wondered whether the \u201clocataire,\u201d now mounting to his apartments, were as\r\n      unsettled in mind and condition as I was, or whether he lived in the calm\r\n      of certain resources, and in the freedom of unfettered feelings. What! was\r\n      he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible\r\n      thought? He had actually knocked at the door\u2014at my door; a smart,\r\n      prompt rap; and, almost before I could invite him in, he was over the\r\n      threshold, and had closed the door behind him.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnd how are you?\u201d asked an indifferent, quiet voice, in the English\r\n      language; while my visitor, without any sort of bustle or introduction,\r\n      put his hat on the table, and his gloves into his hat, and drawing the\r\n      only armchair the room afforded a little forward, seated himself\r\n      tranquilly therein.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCan\u2019t you speak?\u201d he inquired in a few moments, in a tone whose\r\n      nonchalance seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether I\r\n      answered or not. The fact is, I found it desirable to have recourse to my\r\n      good friends \u201cles b\u00e9sicles;\u201d not exactly to ascertain the identity of my\r\n      visitor\u2014for I already knew him, confound his impudence! but to see\r\n      how he looked\u2014to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance. I\r\n      wiped the glasses very deliberately, and put them on quite as\r\n      deliberately; adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or\r\n      get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair. I was sitting in the\r\n      window-seat, with my back to the light, and I had him\r\n      vis-\u00e0-vis; a position he would much rather have had\r\n      reversed; for, at any time, he preferred scrutinizing to being\r\n      scrutinized. Yes, it was he, and no mistake, with his six feet\r\n      of length arranged in a sitting attitude; with his dark travelling surtout\r\n      with its velvet collar, his gray pantaloons, his black stock, and\r\n      his face, the most original one Nature ever modelled,\r\n      yet the least obtrusively so; not one feature that could be termed marked\r\n      or odd, yet the effect of the whole unique. There is no use in attempting\r\n      to describe what is indescribable. Being in no hurry to address him, I sat\r\n      and stared at my ease.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOh, that\u2019s your game\u2014is it?\u201d said he at last. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see\r\n      which is soonest tired.\u201d And he slowly drew out a fine cigar-case, picked\r\n      one to his taste, lit it, took a book from the shelf convenient to his\r\n      hand, then leaning back, proceeded to smoke and read as tranquilly as if\r\n      he had been in his own room, in Grove-street, X\u2014-shire, England. I\r\n      knew he was capable of continuing in that attitude till midnight, if he\r\n      conceived the whim, so I rose, and taking the book from his hand, I said,\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou did not ask for it, and you shall not have it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIt is silly and dull,\u201d he observed, \u201cso I have not lost much;\u201d then the\r\n      spell being broken, he went on: \u201cI thought you lived at Pelet\u2019s; I went\r\n      there this afternoon expecting to be starved to death by sitting in a\r\n      boarding-school drawing-room, and they told me you were gone, had departed\r\n      this morning; you had left your address behind you though, which I\r\n      wondered at; it was a more practical and sensible precaution than I should\r\n      have imagined you capable of. Why did you leave?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBecause M. Pelet has just married the lady whom you and Mr. Brown\r\n      assigned to me as my wife.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d replied Hunsden with a short laugh; \u201cso you\u2019ve lost both\r\n      your wife and your place?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely so.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I saw him give a quick, covert glance all round my room; he marked its\r\n      narrow limits, its scanty furniture: in an instant he had comprehended the\r\n      state of matters\u2014had absolved me from the crime of prosperity. A\r\n      curious effect this discovery wrought in his strange mind; I am morally\r\n      certain that if he had found me installed in a handsome parlour, lounging\r\n      on a soft couch, with a pretty, wealthy wife at my side, he would have\r\n      hated me; a brief, cold, haughty visit, would in such a case have been the\r\n      extreme limit of his civilities, and never would he have come near me\r\n      more, so long as the tide of fortune bore me smoothly on its surface; but\r\n      the painted furniture, the bare walls, the cheerless solitude of my room\r\n      relaxed his rigid pride, and I know not what softening change had taken\r\n      place both in his voice and look ere he spoke again.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have got another place?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou are in the way of getting one?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat is bad; have you applied to Brown?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou had better; he often has it in his power to give useful information\r\n      in such matters.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHe served me once very well; I have no claim on him, and am not in the\r\n      humour to bother him again.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, if you\u2019re bashful, and dread being intrusive, you need only\r\n      commission me. I shall see him to-night; I can put in a word.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI beg you will not, Mr. Hunsden; I am in your debt already; you did me an\r\n      important service when I was at X\u2014\u2014; got me out of a den where\r\n      I was dying: that service I have never repaid, and at present I decline\r\n      positively adding another item to the account.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIf the wind sits that way, I\u2019m satisfied. I thought my unexampled\r\n      generosity in turning you out of that accursed counting-house would be\r\n      duly appreciated some day: \u2018Cast your bread on the waters, and it shall be\r\n      found after many days,\u2019 say the Scriptures. Yes, that\u2019s right, lad\u2014make\r\n      much of me\u2014I\u2019m a nonpareil: there\u2019s nothing like me in the common\r\n      herd. In the meantime, to put all humbug aside and talk sense for a few\r\n      moments, you would be greatly the better of a situation, and what is more,\r\n      you are a fool if you refuse to take one from any hand that offers it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery well, Mr. Hunsden; now you have settled that point, talk of\r\n      something else. What news from X\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI have not settled that point, or at least there is another to settle\r\n      before we get to X\u2014\u2014. Is this Miss Z\u00e9nobie\u201d (Zora\u00efde,\r\n      interposed I)\u2014\u201cwell, Zora\u00efde\u2014is she really married to Pelet?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI tell you yes\u2014and if you don\u2019t believe me, go and ask the cur\u00e9 of\r\n      St. Jacques.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd your heart is broken?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI am not aware that it is; it feels all right\u2014beats as usual.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThen your feelings are less superfine than I took them to be; you must be\r\n      a coarse, callous character, to bear such a thwack without staggering\r\n      under it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStaggering under it? What the deuce is there to stagger under in the\r\n      circumstance of a Belgian schoolmistress marrying a French schoolmaster?\r\n      The progeny will doubtless be a strange hybrid race; but that\u2019s their\r\n      look-out\u2014not mine.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHe indulges in scurrilous jests, and the bride was his affianced one!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWho said so?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBrown.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Hunsden\u2014Brown is an old gossip.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHe is; but in the meantime, if his gossip be founded on less than fact\u2014if\r\n      you took no particular interest in Miss Zora\u00efde\u2014why, O youthful\r\n      pedagogue! did you leave your place in consequence of her becoming Madame\r\n      Pelet?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBecause\u2014\u201d I felt my face grow a little hot; \u201cbecause\u2014in\r\n      short, Mr. Hunsden, I decline answering any more questions,\u201d and I plunged\r\n      my hands deep in my breeches pocket.\r\n    \n\r\n      Hunsden triumphed: his eyes\u2014his laugh announced victory.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat the deuce are you laughing at, Mr. Hunsden?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAt your exemplary composure. Well, lad, I\u2019ll not bore you; I see how it\r\n      is: Zora\u00efde has jilted you\u2014married some one richer, as any sensible\r\n      woman would have done if she had had the chance.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I made no reply\u2014I let him think so, not feeling inclined to enter\r\n      into an explanation of the real state of things, and as little to forge a\r\n      false account; but it was not easy to blind Hunsden; my very silence,\r\n      instead of convincing him that he had hit the truth, seemed to render him\r\n      doubtful about it; he went on:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI suppose the affair has been conducted as such affairs always are\r\n      amongst rational people: you offered her your youth and your talents\u2014such\r\n      as they are\u2014in exchange for her position and money: I don\u2019t suppose you\r\n      took appearance, or what is called love, into the account\u2014for I\r\n      understand she is older than you, and Brown says, rather sensible-looking\r\n      than beautiful. She, having then no chance of making a better bargain,\r\n      was at first inclined to come to terms with you, but Pelet\u2014the head of a\r\n      flourishing school\u2014stepped in with a higher bid; she accepted, and\r\n      he has got her: a correct transaction\u2014perfectly so\u2014business-like\r\n      and legitimate. And now we\u2019ll talk of something else.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDo,\u201d said I, very glad to dismiss the topic, and especially glad to have\r\n      baffled the sagacity of my cross-questioner\u2014if, indeed, I had\r\n      baffled it; for though his words now led away from the dangerous point,\r\n      his eyes, keen and watchful, seemed still preoccupied with the former\r\n      idea.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou want to hear news from X\u2014\u2014? And what interest can you\r\n      have in X\u2014\u2014? You left no friends there, for you made none.\r\n      Nobody ever asks after you\u2014neither man nor woman; and if I mention\r\n      your name in company, the men look as if I had spoken of Prester John; and\r\n      the women sneer covertly. Our X\u2014\u2014 belles must have disliked\r\n      you. How did you excite their displeasure?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know. I seldom spoke to them\u2014they were nothing to me. I\r\n      considered them only as something to be glanced at from a distance; their\r\n      dresses and faces were often pleasing enough to the eye: but I could not\r\n      understand their conversation, nor even read their countenances. When I\r\n      caught snatches of what they said, I could never make much of it; and the\r\n      play of their lips and eyes did not help me at all.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat was your fault, not theirs. There are sensible, as well as handsome\r\n      women in X\u2014\u2014; women it is worth any man\u2019s while to talk to,\r\n      and with whom I can talk with pleasure: but you had and have no pleasant\r\n      address; there is nothing in you to induce a woman to be affable. I have\r\n      remarked you sitting near the door in a room full of company, bent on\r\n      hearing, not on speaking; on observing, not on entertaining; looking\r\n      frigidly shy at the commencement of a party, confusingly vigilant about\r\n      the middle, and insultingly weary towards the end. Is that the way, do you\r\n      think, ever to communicate pleasure or excite interest? No; and if you are\r\n      generally unpopular, it is because you deserve to be so.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cContent!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo, you are not content; you see beauty always turning its back on you;\r\n      you are mortified and then you sneer. I verily believe all that is\r\n      desirable on earth\u2014wealth, reputation, love\u2014will for ever to\r\n      you be the ripe grapes on the high trellis: you\u2019ll look up at them; they\r\n      will tantalize in you the lust of the eye; but they are out of reach: you\r\n      have not the address to fetch a ladder, and you\u2019ll go away calling them\r\n      sour.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Cutting as these words might have been under some circumstances, they drew\r\n      no blood now. My life was changed; my experience had been varied since I\r\n      left X\u2014\u2014, but Hunsden could not know this; he had seen me only\r\n      in the character of Mr. Crimsworth\u2019s clerk\u2014a dependant amongst\r\n      wealthy strangers, meeting disdain with a hard front, conscious of an\r\n      unsocial and unattractive exterior, refusing to sue for notice which I was\r\n      sure would be withheld, declining to evince an admiration which I knew\r\n      would be scorned as worthless. He could not be aware that since then youth\r\n      and loveliness had been to me everyday objects; that I had studied them at\r\n      leisure and closely, and had seen the plain texture of truth under the\r\n      embroidery of appearance; nor could he, keen-sighted as he was, penetrate\r\n      into my heart, search my brain, and read my peculiar sympathies and\r\n      antipathies; he had not known me long enough, or well enough, to perceive\r\n      how low my feelings would ebb under some influences, powerful over most\r\n      minds; how high, how fast they would flow under other influences, that\r\n      perhaps acted with the more intense force on me, because they acted on me\r\n      alone. Neither could he suspect for an instant the history of my\r\n      communications with Mdlle. Reuter; secret to him and to all others was the\r\n      tale of her strange infatuation; her blandishments, her wiles had been\r\n      seen but by me, and to me only were they known; but they had changed me,\r\n      for they had proved that I could impress. A sweeter secret\r\n      nestled deeper\r\n      in my heart; one full of tenderness and as full of strength: it took the\r\n      sting out of Hunsden\u2019s sarcasm; it kept me unbent by shame, and unstirred\r\n      by wrath. But of all this I could say nothing\u2014nothing decisive at\r\n      least; uncertainty sealed my lips, and during the interval of silence by\r\n      which alone I replied to Mr. Hunsden, I made up my mind to be for the\r\n      present wholly misjudged by him, and misjudged I was; he thought he had\r\n      been rather too hard upon me, and that I was crushed by the weight of his\r\n      upbraidings; so to re-assure me he said, doubtless I should mend some day;\r\n      I was only at the beginning of life yet; and since happily I was not quite\r\n      without sense, every false step I made would be a good lesson.\r\n    \n\r\n      Just then I turned my face a little to the light; the approach of\r\n      twilight, and my position in the window-seat, had, for the last ten\r\n      minutes, prevented him from studying my countenance; as I moved, however,\r\n      he caught an expression which he thus interpreted:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cConfound it! How doggedly self-approving the lad looks! I thought he was\r\n      fit to die with shame, and there he sits grinning smiles, as good as to\r\n      say, \u2018Let the world wag as it will, I\u2019ve the philosopher\u2019s stone in my\r\n      waist-coat pocket, and the elixir of life in my cupboard; I\u2019m independent\r\n      of both Fate and Fortune.\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHunsden\u2014you spoke of grapes; I was thinking of a fruit I like\r\n      better than your X\u2014\u2014 hot-house grapes\u2014an unique fruit,\r\n      growing wild, which I have marked as my own, and hope one day to gather\r\n      and taste. It is of no use your offering me the draught of bitterness, or\r\n      threatening me with death by thirst: I have the anticipation of sweetness\r\n      on my palate; the hope of freshness on my lips; I can reject the\r\n      unsavoury, and endure the exhausting.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cFor how long?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTill the next opportunity for effort; and as the prize of success will be\r\n      a treasure after my own heart, I\u2019ll bring a bull\u2019s strength to the\r\n      struggle.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBad luck crushes bulls as easily as bullaces; and, I believe, the fury\r\n      dogs you: you were born with a wooden spoon in your mouth, depend on it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI believe you; and I mean to make my wooden spoon do the work of some\r\n      people\u2019s silver ladles: grasped firmly, and handled nimbly, even a wooden\r\n      spoon will shovel up broth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden rose: \u201cI see,\u201d said he; \u201cI suppose you\u2019re one of those who develop\r\n      best unwatched, and act best unaided\u2014work your own way. Now, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\r\n       And, without another word, he was going; at the door he turned:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCrimsworth Hall is sold,\u201d said he.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSold!\u201d was my echo.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes; you know, of course, that your brother failed three months ago?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Edward Crimsworth?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely; and his wife went home to her father\u2019s; when affairs went\r\n      awry, his temper sympathized with them; he used her ill; I told you he\r\n      would be a tyrant to her some day; as to him\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAy, as to him\u2014what is become of him?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNothing extraordinary\u2014don\u2019t be alarmed; he put himself under the\r\n      protection of the court, compounded with his creditors\u2014tenpence in\r\n      the pound; in six weeks set up again, coaxed back his wife, and is\r\n      flourishing like a green bay-tree.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd Crimsworth Hall\u2014was the furniture sold too?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cEverything\u2014from the grand piano down to the rolling-pin.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd the contents of the oak dining-room\u2014were they sold?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOf course; why should the sofas and chairs of that room be held more\r\n      sacred than those of any other?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd the pictures?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat pictures? Crimsworth had no special collection that I know of\u2014he\r\n      did not profess to be an amateur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere were two portraits, one on each side the mantelpiece; you cannot\r\n      have forgotten them, Mr. Hunsden; you once noticed that of the lady\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, I know\u2014the thin-faced gentlewoman with a shawl put on like\r\n      drapery. Why, as a matter of course, it would be sold among the other\r\n      things. If you had been rich, you might have bought it, for I remember you\r\n      said it represented your mother: you see what it is to be without a sou.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I did. \u201cBut surely,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cI shall not always be so\r\n      poverty-stricken; I may one day buy it back yet. Who purchased it?\r\n      do you know?\u201d I asked.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow is it likely? I never inquired who purchased anything; there spoke\r\n      the unpractical man\u2014to imagine all the world is interested in what\r\n      interests himself! Now, good night\u2014I\u2019m off for Germany to-morrow\r\n      morning; I shall be back here in six weeks, and possibly I may call and\r\n      see you again; I wonder whether you\u2019ll be still out of place!\u201d he laughed,\r\n      as mockingly, as heartlessly as Mephistopheles, and so laughing, vanished.\r\n    \n\r\n      Some people, however indifferent they may become after a considerable\r\n      space of absence, always contrive to leave a pleasant impression just at\r\n      parting; not so Hunsden, a conference with him affected one like a draught\r\n      of Peruvian bark; it seemed a concentration of the specially harsh,\r\n      stringent, bitter; whether, like bark, it invigorated, I scarcely knew.\r\n    \n\r\n      A ruffled mind makes a restless pillow; I slept little on the night after\r\n      this interview; towards morning I began to doze, but hardly had my slumber\r\n      become sleep, when I was roused from it by hearing a noise in my sitting\r\n      room, to which my bed-room adjoined\u2014a step, and a shoving of\r\n      furniture; the movement lasted barely two minutes; with the closing of the\r\n      door it ceased. I listened; not a mouse stirred; perhaps I had dreamt it;\r\n      perhaps a locataire had made a mistake, and entered my\r\n      apartment instead of his own. It was yet but five o\u2019clock; neither I nor\r\n      the day were wide awake; I turned, and was soon unconscious. When I did\r\n      rise, about two  hours later, I had forgotten the circumstance; the first\r\n      thing I saw, however, on quitting my chamber, recalled it; just pushed in\r\n      at the door of my sitting-room, and still standing on end, was a wooden\r\n      packing-case\u2014a rough deal affair, wide but shallow; a porter had doubtless\r\n      shoved it forward, but seeing no occupant of the room, had left it at the\r\n      entrance.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThat is none of mine,\u201d thought I, approaching; \u201cit must be meant for\r\n      somebody else.\u201d I stooped to examine the address:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWm. Crimsworth, Esq., No \u2014, \u2014 St., Brussels.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I was puzzled, but concluding that the best way to obtain information was\r\n      to ask within, I cut the cords and opened the case. Green baize enveloped\r\n      its contents, sewn carefully at the sides; I ripped the pack-thread with\r\n      my pen-knife, and still, as the seam gave way, glimpses of gilding\r\n      appeared through the widening interstices. Boards and baize being at\r\n      length removed, I lifted from the case a large picture, in a magnificent\r\n      frame; leaning it against a chair, in a position where the light from the\r\n      window fell favourably upon it, I stepped back\u2014already I had mounted\r\n      my spectacles. A portrait-painter\u2019s sky (the most sombre and threatening\r\n      of welkins), and distant trees of a conventional depth of hue, raised in\r\n      full relief a pale, pensive-looking female face, shadowed with soft dark\r\n      hair, almost blending with the equally dark clouds; large, solemn eyes\r\n      looked reflectively into mine; a thin cheek rested on a delicate little\r\n      hand; a shawl, artistically draped, half hid, half showed a slight figure.\r\n      A listener (had there been one) might have heard me, after ten minutes\u2019\r\n      silent gazing, utter the word \u201cMother!\u201d I might have said more\u2014but\r\n      with me, the first word uttered aloud in soliloquy rouses consciousness;\r\n      it reminds me that only crazy people talk to themselves, and then I think\r\n      out my monologue, instead of speaking it. I had thought a long while, and\r\n      a long while had contemplated the intelligence, the sweetness, and\u2014alas!\r\n      the sadness also of those fine, grey eyes, the mental power of that\r\n      forehead, and the rare sensibility of that serious mouth, when my glance,\r\n      travelling downwards, fell on a narrow billet, stuck in the corner of the\r\n      picture, between the frame and the canvas. Then I first asked, \u201cWho sent\r\n      this picture? Who thought of me, saved it out of the wreck of Crimsworth\r\n      Hall, and now commits it to the care of its natural keeper?\u201d I took the\r\n      note from its niche; thus it spoke:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere is a sort of stupid pleasure in giving a child sweets, a fool his\r\n      bells, a dog a bone. You are repaid by seeing the child besmear his face\r\n      with sugar; by witnessing how the fool\u2019s ecstasy makes a greater fool of\r\n      him than ever; by watching the dog\u2019s nature come out over his bone. In\r\n      giving William Crimsworth his mother\u2019s picture, I give him sweets, bells,\r\n      and bone all in one; what grieves me is, that I cannot behold the result;\r\n      I would have added five shillings more to my bid if the auctioneer could\r\n      only have promised me that pleasure.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cH. Y. H.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cP.S.\u2014You said last night you positively declined adding another\r\n      item to your account with me; don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve saved you that\r\n      trouble?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I muffled the picture in its green baize covering, restored it to the\r\n      case, and having transported the whole concern to my bed-room, put it out\r\n      of sight under my bed. My pleasure was now poisoned by pungent pain; I\r\n      determined to look no more till I could look at my ease. If Hunsden had\r\n      come in at that moment, I should have said to him, \u201cI owe you nothing,\r\n      Hunsden\u2014not a fraction of a farthing: you have paid yourself in\r\n      taunts!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Too anxious to remain any longer quiescent, I had no sooner breakfasted,\r\n      than I repaired once more to M. Vandenhuten\u2019s, scarcely hoping to find him\r\n      at home; for a week had barely elapsed since my first call: but fancying I\r\n      might be able to glean information as to the time when his return was\r\n      expected. A better result awaited me than I had anticipated, for though\r\n      the family were yet at Ostend, M. Vandenhuten had come over to Brussels on\r\n      business for the day. He received me with the quiet kindness of a sincere\r\n      though not excitable man. I had not sat five minutes alone with him in his\r\n      bureau, before I became aware of a sense of ease in his presence, such as\r\n      I rarely experienced with strangers. I was surprised at my own composure,\r\n      for, after all, I had come on business to me exceedingly painful\u2014that\r\n      of soliciting a favour. I asked on what basis the calm rested\u2014I\r\n      feared it might be deceptive. Ere long I caught a glimpse of the ground,\r\n      and at once I felt assured of its solidity; I knew where it was.\r\n    \n\r\n      M. Vandenhuten was rich, respected, and influential; I, poor, despised and\r\n      powerless; so we stood to the world at large as members of the world\u2019s\r\n      society; but to each other, as a pair of human beings, our positions were\r\n      reversed. The Dutchman (he was not Flamand, but pure Hollandais) was slow,\r\n      cool, of rather dense intelligence, though sound and accurate judgment;\r\n      the Englishman far more nervous, active, quicker both to plan and to\r\n      practise, to conceive and to realize. The Dutchman was benevolent, the\r\n      Englishman susceptible; in short our characters dovetailed, but my mind\r\n      having more fire and action than his, instinctively assumed and kept the\r\n      predominance.\r\n    \n\r\n      This point settled, and my position well ascertained, I addressed him on\r\n      the subject of my affairs with that genuine frankness which full\r\n      confidence can alone inspire. It was a pleasure to him to be so appealed\r\n      to; he thanked me for giving him this opportunity of using a little\r\n      exertion in my behalf. I went on to explain to him that my wish was not so\r\n      much to be helped, as to be put into the way of helping myself; of him I\r\n      did not want exertion\u2014that was to be my part\u2014but only\r\n      information and recommendation. Soon after I rose to go. He held out his\r\n      hand at parting\u2014an action of greater significance with foreigners\r\n      than with Englishmen. As I exchanged a smile with him, I thought the\r\n      benevolence of his truthful face was better than the intelligence of my\r\n      own. Characters of my order experience a balm-like solace in the contact\r\n      of such souls as animated the honest breast of Victor Vandenhuten.\r\n    \n\r\n      The next fortnight was a period of many alternations; my existence during\r\n      its lapse resembled a sky of one of those autumnal nights which are\r\n      specially haunted by meteors and falling stars. Hopes and fears,\r\n      expectations and disappointments, descended in glancing showers from\r\n      zenith to horizon; but all were transient, and darkness followed swift\r\n      each vanishing apparition. M. Vandenhuten aided me faithfully; he set me\r\n      on the track of several places, and himself made efforts to secure them\r\n      for me; but for a long time solicitation and recommendation were vain\u2014the\r\n      door either shut in my face when I was about to walk in, or another\r\n      candidate, entering before me, rendered my further advance useless.\r\n      Feverish and roused, no disappointment arrested me; defeat following fast\r\n      on defeat served as stimulants to will. I forgot fastidiousness, conquered\r\n      reserve, thrust pride from me: I asked, I persevered, I remonstrated, I\r\n      dunned. It is so that openings are forced into the guarded circle where\r\n      Fortune sits dealing favours round. My perseverance made me known; my\r\n      importunity made me remarked. I was inquired about; my former pupils\u2019\r\n      parents, gathering the reports of their children, heard me spoken of as\r\n      talented, and they echoed the word: the sound, bandied about at random,\r\n      came at last to ears which, but for its universality, it might never have\r\n      reached; and at the very crisis when I had tried my last effort and knew\r\n      not what to do, Fortune looked in at me one morning, as I sat in drear and\r\n      almost desperate deliberation on my bedstead, nodded with the familiarity\r\n      of an old acquaintance\u2014though God knows I had never met her before\u2014and\r\n      threw a prize into my lap.\r\n    \n\r\n      In the second week of October, 18\u2014, I got the appointment of English\r\n      professor to all the classes of \u2014\u2014 College, Brussels, with a\r\n      salary of three thousand francs per annum; and the certainty of being\r\n      able, by dint of the reputation and publicity accompanying the position,\r\n      to make as much more by private means. The official notice, which\r\n      communicated this information, mentioned also that it was the strong\r\n      recommendation of M. Vandenhuten, negociant, which had turned the scale of\r\n      choice in my favour.\r\n    \n\r\n      No sooner had I read the announcement than I hurried to M. Vandenhuten\u2019s\r\n      bureau, pushed the document under his nose, and when he had perused it,\r\n      took both his hands, and thanked him with unrestrained vivacity. My vivid\r\n      words and emphatic gesture moved his Dutch calm to unwonted sensation. He\r\n      said he was happy\u2014glad to have served me; but he had done nothing\r\n      meriting such thanks. He had not laid out a centime\u2014only scratched a\r\n      few words on a sheet of paper.\r\n    \n\r\n      Again I repeated to him\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have made me quite happy, and in a way that suits me; I do not feel\r\n      an obligation irksome, conferred by your kind hand; I do not feel disposed\r\n      to shun you because you have done me a favour; from this day you must\r\n      consent to admit me to your intimate acquaintance, for I shall hereafter\r\n      recur again and again to the pleasure of your society.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAinsi soit-il,\u201d was the reply, accompanied by a smile of benignant\r\n      content. I went away with its sunshine in my heart.\r\n    \n"}
{"23": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIII\r\n    \n\r\n      IT was two o\u2019clock when I returned to my lodgings; my dinner, just brought\r\n      in from a neighbouring hotel, smoked on the table; I sat down thinking to\r\n      eat\u2014had the plate been heaped with potsherds and broken glass,\r\n      instead of boiled beef and haricots, I could not have made a more signal\r\n      failure: appetite had forsaken me. Impatient of seeing food which I could\r\n      not taste, I put it all aside into a cupboard, and then demanded, \u201cWhat\r\n      shall I do till evening?\u201d for before six P.M. it would be vain to seek the\r\n      Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges; its inhabitant (for me it had but one) was\r\n      detained by her vocation elsewhere. I walked in the streets of Brussels,\r\n      and I walked in my own room from two o\u2019clock till six; never once in that\r\n      space of time did I sit down. I was in my chamber when the last-named hour\r\n      struck; I had just bathed my face and feverish hands, and was standing\r\n      near the glass; my cheek was crimson, my eye was flame, still all my\r\n      features looked quite settled and calm. Descending swiftly the stair and\r\n      stepping out, I was glad to see Twilight drawing on in clouds; such shade\r\n      was to me like a grateful screen, and the chill of latter Autumn,\r\n      breathing in a fitful wind from the north-west, met me as a refreshing\r\n      coolness. Still I saw it was cold to others, for the women I passed were\r\n      wrapped in shawls, and the men had their coats buttoned close.\r\n    \n\r\n      When are we quite happy? Was I so then? No; an urgent and growing dread\r\n      worried my nerves, and had worried them since the first moment good\r\n      tidings had reached me. How was Frances? It was ten weeks since I had seen\r\n      her, six since I had heard from her, or of her. I had answered her letter\r\n      by a brief note, friendly but calm, in which no mention of continued\r\n      correspondence or further visits was made. At that hour my bark hung on\r\n      the topmost curl of a wave of fate, and I knew not on what shoal the\r\n      onward rush of the billow might hurl it; I would not then attach her\r\n      destiny to mine by the slightest thread; if doomed to split on the rock,\r\n      or run aground on the sand-bank, I was resolved no other vessel should\r\n      share my disaster: but six weeks was a long time; and could it be that she\r\n      was still well and doing well? Were not all sages agreed in declaring that\r\n      happiness finds no climax on earth? Dared I think that but half a street\r\n      now divided me from the full cup of contentment\u2014the draught drawn\r\n      from waters said to flow only in heaven?\r\n    \n\r\n      I was at the door; I entered the quiet house; I mounted the stairs; the\r\n      lobby was void and still, all the doors closed; I looked for the neat\r\n      green mat; it lay duly in its place.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSignal of hope!\u201d I said, and advanced. \u201cBut I will be a little calmer; I\r\n      am not going to rush in, and get up a scene directly.\u201d Forcibly staying my\r\n      eager step, I paused on the mat.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat an absolute hush! Is she in? Is anybody in?\u201d I demanded to myself. A\r\n      little tinkle, as of cinders falling from a grate, replied; a movement\u2014a\r\n      fire was gently stirred; and the slight rustle of life continuing, a step\r\n      paced equably backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, in the\r\n      apartment. Fascinated, I stood, more fixedly fascinated when a voice\r\n      rewarded the attention of my strained ear\u2014so low, so self-addressed,\r\n      I never fancied the speaker otherwise than alone; solitude might speak\r\n      thus in a desert, or in the hall of a forsaken house.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And ne\u2019er but once, my son,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018Was yon dark cavern trod;\r\n      In persecution\u2019s iron days,\nWhen the land was left by God.\n\n\r\n      From Bewley\u2019s bog, with slaughter red,\nA wanderer hither drew;\r\n      And oft he stopp\u2019d and turn\u2019d his head,\nAs by fits the night-winds blew.\n\n\r\n      For trampling round by Cheviot-edge\nWere heard the troopers keen;\r\n      And frequent from the Whitelaw ridge\nThe death-shot flash\u2019d between.\u2019\u201d &c. &c.\r\n      \n\n\r\n      The old Scotch ballad was partly recited, then dropt; a pause ensued; then\r\n      another strain followed, in French, of which the purport, translated, ran\r\n      as follows:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n     I gave, at first, attention close;\nThen interest warm ensued;\r\n     From interest, as improvement rose,\nSucceeded gratitude.\n\n\r\n     Obedience was no effort soon,\n And labour was no pain;\r\n     If tired, a word, a glance alone\n Would give me strength again.\n\n\r\n     From others of the studious band,\n Ere long he singled me;\r\n     But only by more close demand,\n And sterner urgency.\n\n\r\n     The task he from another took,\n From me he did reject;\r\n     He would no slight omission brook,\n And suffer no defect.\n\n\r\n     If my companions went astray,\n He scarce their wanderings blam\u2019d;\r\n     If I but falter\u2019d in the way,\n His anger fiercely flam\u2019d.\n\n\r\n      Something stirred in an adjoining chamber; it would not do to be surprised\r\n      eaves-dropping; I tapped hastily, and as hastily entered. Frances was just\r\n      before me; she had been walking slowly in her room, and her step was\r\n      checked by my advent: Twilight only was with her, and tranquil, ruddy\r\n      Firelight; to these sisters, the Bright and the Dark, she had been\r\n      speaking, ere I entered, in poetry. Sir Walter Scott\u2019s voice, to her a\r\n      foreign, far-off sound, a mountain echo, had uttered itself in the first\r\n      stanzas; the second, I thought, from the style and the substance, was the\r\n      language of her own heart. Her face was grave, its expression\r\n      concentrated; she bent on me an unsmiling eye\u2014an eye just returning\r\n      from abstraction, just awaking from dreams: well-arranged was her simple\r\n      attire, smooth her dark hair, orderly her tranquil room; but what\u2014with\r\n      her thoughtful look, her serious self-reliance, her bent to meditation and\r\n      haply inspiration\u2014what had she to do with love? \u201cNothing,\u201d was the\r\n      answer of her own sad, though gentle countenance; it seemed to say, \u201cI\r\n      must cultivate fortitude and cling to poetry; one is to be my support and\r\n      the other my solace through life. Human affections do not bloom, nor do\r\n      human passions glow for me.\u201d Other women have such thoughts. Frances, had\r\n      she been as desolate as she deemed, would not have been worse off than\r\n      thousands of her sex. Look at the rigid and formal race of old maids\u2014the\r\n      race whom all despise; they have fed themselves, from youth upwards, on\r\n      maxims of resignation and endurance. Many of them get ossified with the\r\n      dry diet; self-control is so continually their thought, so perpetually\r\n      their object, that at last it absorbs the softer and more agreeable\r\n      qualities of their nature; and they die mere models of austerity,\r\n      fashioned out of a little parchment and much bone. Anatomists will tell\r\n      you that there is a heart in the withered old maid\u2019s carcass\u2014the\r\n      same as in that of any cherished wife or proud mother in the land. Can\r\n      this be so? I really don\u2019t know; but feel inclined to doubt it.\r\n    \n\r\n      I came forward, bade Frances \u201cgood evening,\u201d and took my seat. The chair I\r\n      had chosen was one she had probably just left; it stood by a little table\r\n      where were her open desk and papers. I know not whether she had fully\r\n      recognized me at first, but she did so now; and in a voice, soft but\r\n      quiet, she returned my greeting. I had shown no eagerness; she took her\r\n      cue from me, and evinced no surprise. We met as we had always met, as\r\n      master and pupil\u2014nothing more. I proceeded to handle the papers;\r\n      Frances, observant and serviceable, stepped into an inner room, brought a\r\n      candle, lit it, placed it by me; then drew the curtain over the lattice,\r\n      and having added a little fresh fuel to the already bright fire, she drew\r\n      a second chair to the table and sat down at my right hand, a little\r\n      removed. The paper on the top was a translation of some grave French\r\n      author into English, but underneath lay a sheet with stanzas; on this I\r\n      laid hands. Frances half rose, made a movement to recover the captured\r\n      spoil, saying, that was nothing\u2014a mere copy of verses. I put by\r\n      resistance with the decision I knew she never long opposed; but on this\r\n      occasion her fingers had fastened on the paper. I had quietly to unloose\r\n      them; their hold dissolved to my touch; her hand shrunk away; my own would\r\n      fain have followed it, but for the present I forbade such impulse. The\r\n      first page of the sheet was occupied with the lines I had overheard; the\r\n      sequel was not exactly the writer\u2019s own experience, but a composition by\r\n      portions of that experience suggested. Thus while egotism was avoided, the\r\n      fancy was exercised, and the heart satisfied. I translate as before, and\r\n      my translation is nearly literal; it continued thus:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n     When sickness stay\u2019d awhile my course,\nHe seem\u2019d impatient still,\r\n     Because his pupil\u2019s flagging force\nCould not obey his will.\n\n\r\n     One day when summoned to the bed\n Where pain and I did strive,\r\n     I heard him, as he bent his head,\n Say, \u201cGod, she must revive!\u201d\n\n\r\n     I felt his hand, with gentle stress,\n A moment laid on mine,\r\n     And wished to mark my consciousness\n By some responsive sign.\n\n\r\n     But pow\u2019rless then to speak or move,\n I only felt, within,\r\n     The sense of Hope, the strength of Love,\n Their healing work begin.\n\n\r\n     And as he from the room withdrew,\n My heart his steps pursued;\r\n     I long\u2019d to prove, by efforts new;\n My speechless gratitude.\n\n\r\n     When once again I took my place,\n Long vacant, in the class,\r\n     Th\u2019 unfrequent smile across his face\n Did for one moment pass.\n\n\r\n     The lessons done; the signal made\n Of glad release and play,\r\n     He, as he passed, an instant stay\u2019d,\n One kindly word to say.\n\n\r\n    \u201cJane, till to-morrow you are free\n From tedious task and rule;\r\n     This afternoon I must not see\n That yet pale face in school.\n\n\r\n    \u201cSeek in the garden-shades a seat,\n Far from the play-ground din;\r\n     The sun is warm, the air is sweet:\n Stay till I call you in.\u201d\n\n\r\n     A long and pleasant afternoon\n I passed in those green bowers;\r\n     All silent, tranquil, and alone\n With birds, and bees, and flowers.\n\n\r\n     Yet, when my master\u2019s voice I heard\n Call, from the window, \u201cJane!\u201d\r\n     I entered, joyful, at the word,\n The busy house again.\n\n\r\n     He, in the hall, paced up and down;\n He paused as I passed by;\r\n     His forehead stern relaxed its frown:\n He raised his deep-set eye.\n\n\r\n    \u201cNot quite so pale,\u201d he murmured low.\n \u201cNow Jane, go rest awhile.\u201d\r\n     And as I smiled, his smoothened brow\nReturned as glad a smile.\n\n\r\n     My perfect health restored, he took\n His mien austere again;\r\n     And, as before, he would not brook\n The slightest fault from Jane.\n\n\r\n     The longest task, the hardest theme\n Fell to my share as erst,\r\n     And still I toiled to place my name\n In every study first.\n\n\r\n     He yet begrudged and stinted praise,\n But I had learnt to read\r\n     The secret meaning of his face,\n And that was my best meed.\n\n\r\n     Even when his hasty temper spoke\n In tones that sorrow stirred,\r\n     My grief was lulled as soon as woke\n By some relenting word.\n\n\r\n     And when he lent some precious book,\n Or gave some fragrant flower,\r\n     I did not quail to Envy\u2019s look,\n Upheld by Pleasure\u2019s power.\n\n\r\n     At last our school ranks took their ground,\n The hard-fought field I won;\r\n     The prize, a laurel-wreath, was bound\n My throbbing forehead on.\n\n\r\n     Low at my master\u2019s knee I bent,\n The offered crown to meet;\r\n     Its green leaves through my temples sent\n A thrill as wild as sweet.\n\n\r\n     The strong pulse of Ambition struck\n In every vein I owned;\r\n     At the same instant, bleeding broke\n A secret, inward wound.\n\n\r\n     The hour of triumph was to me\n The hour of sorrow sore;\r\n     A day hence I must cross the sea,\n Ne\u2019er to recross it more.\n\n\r\n     An hour hence, in my master\u2019s room\n I with him sat alone,\r\n     And told him what a dreary gloom\n O\u2019er joy had parting thrown.\n\n\r\n     He little said; the time was brief,\n The ship was soon to sail,\r\n     And while I sobbed in bitter grief,\n My master but looked pale.\n\n\r\n     They called in haste; he bade me go,\n Then snatched me back again;\r\n     He held me fast and murmured low,\n\u201cWhy will they part us, Jane?\u201d\n\n\r\n    \u201cWere you not happy in my care?\n Did I not faithful prove?\r\n     Will others to my darling bear\n As true, as deep a love?\n\n\r\n    \u201cO God, watch o\u2019er my foster child!\n O guard her gentle head!\r\n     When minds are high and tempests wild\n Protection round her spread!\n\n\r\n    \u201cThey call again; leave then my breast;\n Quit thy true shelter, Jane;\r\n     But when deceived, repulsed, opprest,\n Come home to me again!\u201d\n\n\r\n      I read\u2014then dreamily made marks on the margin with my pencil;\r\n      thinking all the while of other things; thinking that \u201cJane\u201d was now at my\r\n      side; no child, but a girl of nineteen; and she might be mine, so my heart\r\n      affirmed; Poverty\u2019s curse was taken off me; Envy and Jealousy were far\r\n      away, and unapprized of this our quiet meeting; the frost of the Master\u2019s\r\n      manner might melt; I felt the thaw coming fast, whether I would or not; no\r\n      further need for the eye to practise a hard look, for the brow to compress\r\n      its expanse into a stern fold: it was now permitted to suffer the outward\r\n      revelation of the inward glow\u2014to seek, demand, elicit an answering\r\n      ardour. While musing thus, I thought that the grass on Hermon never drank\r\n      the fresh dews of sunset more gratefully than my feelings drank the bliss\r\n      of this hour.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances rose, as if restless; she passed before me to stir the fire, which\r\n      did not want stirring; she lifted and put down the little ornaments on the\r\n      mantelpiece; her dress waved within a yard of me; slight, straight, and\r\n      elegant, she stood erect on the hearth.\r\n    \n\r\n      There are impulses we can control; but there are others which control us,\r\n      because they attain us with a tiger-leap, and are our masters ere we have\r\n      seen them. Perhaps, though, such impulses are seldom altogether bad;\r\n      perhaps Reason, by a process as brief as quiet, a process that is finished\r\n      ere felt, has ascertained the sanity of the deed. Instinct meditates, and\r\n      feels justified in remaining passive while it is performed. I know I did\r\n      not reason, I did not plan or intend, yet, whereas one moment I was\r\n      sitting solus on the chair near the table, the next, I held Frances on my\r\n      knee, placed there with sharpness and decision, and retained with\r\n      exceeding tenacity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur!\u201d cried Frances, and was still: not another word escaped her\r\n      lips; sorely confounded she seemed during the lapse of the first few\r\n      moments; but the amazement soon subsided; terror did not succeed, nor\r\n      fury: after all, she was only a little nearer than she had ever been\r\n      before, to one she habitually respected and trusted; embarrassment might\r\n      have impelled her to contend, but self-respect checked resistance where\r\n      resistance was useless.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFrances, how much regard have you for me?\u201d was my demand. No answer; the\r\n      situation was yet too new and surprising to permit speech. On this\r\n      consideration, I compelled myself for some seconds to tolerate her\r\n      silence, though impatient of it: presently, I repeated the same\r\n      question\u2014probably, not in the calmest of tones; she looked at me; my face,\r\n      doubtless, was no model of composure, my eyes no still wells of\r\n      tranquillity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDo speak,\u201d I urged; and a very low, hurried, yet still arch voice said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, vous me fa\u00eetes mal; de gr\u00e2ce l\u00e2chez un peu ma main droite.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      In truth I became aware that I was holding the said \u201cmain droite\u201d in a\r\n      somewhat ruthless grasp: I did as desired; and, for the third time, asked\r\n      more gently\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFrances, how much regard have you for me?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMon ma\u00eetre, j\u2019en ai beaucoup,\u201d was the truthful rejoinder.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFrances, have you enough to give yourself to me as my wife?\u2014to\r\n      accept me as your husband?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I felt the agitation of the heart, I saw \u201cthe purple light of love\u201d cast\r\n      its glowing reflection on cheeks, temples, neck; I desired to consult the\r\n      eye, but sheltering lash and lid forbade.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the soft voice at last,\u2014\u201cMonsieur d\u00e9sire savoir si\r\n      je consens\u2014si\u2014enfin, si je veux me marier avec lui?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJustement.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur sera-t-il aussi bon mari qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bon ma\u00eetre?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI will try, Frances.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      A pause; then with a new, yet still subdued inflexion of the voice\u2014an\r\n      inflexion which provoked while it pleased me\u2014accompanied, too, by a\r\n      \u201csourire \u00e0 la fois fin et timide\u201d in perfect harmony with the tone:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cC\u2019est \u00e0 dire, monsieur sera toujours un peu ent\u00eat\u00e9 exigeant,\r\n      volontaire\u2014?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHave I been so, Frances?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais oui; vous le savez bien.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHave I been nothing else?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMais oui; vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 mon meilleur ami.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd what, Frances, are you to me?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVotre d\u00e9vou\u00e9e \u00e9l\u00e8ve, qui vous aime de tout son coeur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWill my pupil consent to pass her life with me? Speak English now,\r\n      Frances.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Some moments were taken for reflection; the answer, pronounced slowly, ran\r\n      thus:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have always made me happy; I like to hear you speak; I like to see\r\n      you; I like to be near you; I believe you are very good, and very\r\n      superior; I know you are stern to those who are careless and idle, but you\r\n      are kind, very kind to the attentive and industrious, even if they are not\r\n      clever. Master, I should be glad to live with you always;\u201d and\r\n      she made a sort of movement, as if she would have clung to me, but\r\n      restraining herself she only added with earnest emphasis\u2014\u201cMaster, I\r\n      consent to pass my life with you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVery well, Frances.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I drew her a little nearer to my heart; I took a first kiss from her lips,\r\n      thereby sealing the compact, now framed between us; afterwards she and I\r\n      were silent, nor was our silence brief. Frances\u2019 thoughts, during this\r\n      interval, I know not, nor did I attempt to guess them; I was not occupied\r\n      in searching her countenance, nor in otherwise troubling her composure.\r\n      The peace I felt, I wished her to feel; my arm, it is true, still detained\r\n      her; but with a restraint that was gentle enough, so long as no opposition\r\n      tightened it. My gaze was on the red fire; my heart was measuring its own\r\n      content; it sounded and sounded, and found the depth fathomless.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d at last said my quiet companion, as stirless in her happiness\r\n      as a mouse in its terror. Even now in speaking she scarcely lifted her\r\n      head.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, Frances?\u201d I like unexaggerated intercourse; it is not my way to\r\n      overpower with amorous epithets, any more than to worry with selfishly\r\n      importunate caresses.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur est raisonnable, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes; especially when I am requested to be so in English: but why do you\r\n      ask me? You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner; am I not\r\n      tranquil enough?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCe n\u2019est pas cela\u2014\u201d began Frances.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cEnglish!\u201d I reminded her.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, monsieur, I wished merely to say, that I should like, of course, to\r\n      retain my employment of teaching. You will teach still, I suppose,\r\n      monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes! It is all I have to depend on.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBon!\u2014I mean good. Thus we shall have both the same profession. I\r\n      like that; and my efforts to get on will be as unrestrained as yours\u2014will\r\n      they not, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou are laying plans to be independent of me,\u201d said I.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes, monsieur; I must be no incumbrance to you\u2014no burden in any\r\n      way.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut, Frances, I have not yet told you what my prospects are. I have left\r\n      M. Pelet\u2019s; and after nearly a month\u2019s seeking, I have got another place,\r\n      with a salary of three thousand francs a year, which I can easily double\r\n      by a little additional exertion. Thus you see it would be useless for you\r\n      to fag yourself by going out to give lessons; on six thousand francs you\r\n      and I can live, and live well.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Frances seemed to consider. There is something flattering to man\u2019s\r\n      strength, something consonant to his honourable pride, in the idea of\r\n      becoming the providence of what he loves\u2014feeding and clothing it, as\r\n      God does the lilies of the field. So, to decide her resolution, I went\r\n      on:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cLife has been painful and laborious enough to you so far, Frances; you\r\n      require complete rest; your twelve hundred francs would not form a very\r\n      important addition to our income, and what sacrifice of comfort to earn\r\n      it! Relinquish your labours: you must be weary, and let me have the\r\n      happiness of giving you rest.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I am not sure whether Frances had accorded due attention to my harangue;\r\n      instead of answering me with her usual respectful promptitude, she only\r\n      sighed and said,\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHow rich you are, monsieur!\u201d and then she stirred uneasy in my arms.\r\n      \u201cThree thousand francs!\u201d she murmured, \u201cWhile I get only twelve hundred!\u201d\r\n       She went on faster. \u201cHowever, it must be so for the present; and,\r\n      monsieur, were you not saying something about my giving up my place? Oh\r\n      no! I shall hold it fast;\u201d and her little fingers emphatically tightened\r\n      on mine.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThink of my marrying you to be kept by you, monsieur! I could not do it;\r\n      and how dull my days would be! You would be away teaching in close, noisy\r\n      school-rooms, from morning till evening, and I should be lingering at\r\n      home, unemployed and solitary; I should get depressed and sullen, and you\r\n      would soon tire of me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cFrances, you could read and study\u2014two things you like so well.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I could not; I like a contemplative life, but I like an active\r\n      life better; I must act in some way, and act with you. I have taken\r\n      notice, monsieur, that people who are only in each other\u2019s company for\r\n      amusement, never really like each other so well, or esteem each other so\r\n      highly, as those who work together, and perhaps suffer together.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou speak God\u2019s truth,\u201d said I at last, \u201cand you shall have your own way,\r\n      for it is the best way. Now, as a reward for such ready consent, give me a\r\n      voluntary kiss.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      After some hesitation, natural to a novice in the art of kissing, she\r\n      brought her lips into very shy and gentle contact with my forehead; I took\r\n      the small gift as a loan, and repaid it promptly, and with generous\r\n      interest.\r\n    \n\r\n      I know not whether Frances was really much altered since the time I first\r\n      saw her; but, as I looked at her now, I felt that she was singularly\r\n      changed for me; the sad eye, the pale cheek, the dejected and joyless\r\n      countenance I remembered as her early attributes, were quite gone, and now\r\n      I saw a face dressed in graces; smile, dimple, and rosy tint rounded its\r\n      contours and brightened its hues. I had been accustomed to nurse a\r\n      flattering idea that my strong attachment to her proved some particular\r\n      perspicacity in my nature; she was not handsome, she was not rich, she was\r\n      not even accomplished, yet was she my life\u2019s treasure; I must then be a\r\n      man of peculiar discernment. To-night my eyes opened on the mistake I had\r\n      made; I began to suspect that it was only my tastes which were unique, not\r\n      my power of discovering and appreciating the superiority of moral worth\r\n      over physical charms. For me Frances had physical charms: in her there was\r\n      no deformity to get over; none of those prominent defects of eyes, teeth,\r\n      complexion, shape, which hold at bay the admiration of the boldest male\r\n      champions of intellect (for women can love a downright ugly man if he be\r\n      but talented); had she been either \u201c\u00e9dent\u00e9e, myope, rugueuse, ou bossue,\u201d\r\n      my feelings towards her might still have been kindly, but they could never\r\n      have been impassioned; I had affection for the poor little misshapen\r\n      Sylvie, but for her I could never have had love. It is true Frances\u2019\r\n      mental points had been the first to interest me, and they still retained\r\n      the strongest hold on my preference; but I liked the graces of her person\r\n      too. I derived a pleasure, purely material, from contemplating the\r\n      clearness of her brown eyes, the fairness of her fine skin, the purity of\r\n      her well-set teeth, the proportion of her delicate form; and that pleasure\r\n      I could ill have dispensed with. It appeared, then, that I too was a\r\n      sensualist, in my temperate and fastidious way.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now, reader, during the last two pages I have been giving you honey fresh\r\n      from flowers, but you must not live entirely on food so luscious; taste\r\n      then a little gall\u2014just a drop, by way of change.\r\n    \n\r\n      At a somewhat late hour I returned to my lodgings: having temporarily\r\n      forgotten that man had any such coarse cares as those of eating and\r\n      drinking, I went to bed fasting. I had been excited and in action all day,\r\n      and had tasted no food since eight that morning; besides, for a fortnight\r\n      past, I had known no rest either of body or mind; the last few hours had\r\n      been a sweet delirium, it would not subside now, and till long after\r\n      midnight, broke with troubled ecstacy the rest I so much needed. At last I\r\n      dozed, but not for long; it was yet quite dark when I awoke, and my waking\r\n      was like that of Job when a spirit passed before his face, and like him,\r\n      \u201cthe hair of my flesh stood up.\u201d I might continue the parallel, for in\r\n      truth, though I saw nothing, yet \u201ca thing was secretly brought unto me,\r\n      and mine ear received a little thereof; there was silence, and I heard a\r\n      voice,\u201d saying\u2014\u201cIn the midst of life we are in death.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      That sound, and the sensation of chill anguish accompanying it, many would\r\n      have regarded as supernatural; but I recognized it at once as the effect\r\n      of reaction. Man is ever clogged with his mortality, and it was my mortal\r\n      nature which now faltered and plained; my nerves, which jarred and gave a\r\n      false sound, because the soul, of late rushing headlong to an aim, had\r\n      overstrained the body\u2019s comparative weakness. A horror of great darkness\r\n      fell upon me; I felt my chamber invaded by one I had known formerly, but\r\n      had thought for ever departed. I was temporarily a prey to hypochondria.\r\n    \n\r\n      She had been my acquaintance, nay, my guest, once before in boyhood; I had\r\n      entertained her at bed and board for a year; for that space of time I had\r\n      her to myself in secret; she lay with me, she ate with me, she walked out\r\n      with me, showing me nooks in woods, hollows in hills, where we could sit\r\n      together, and where she could drop her drear veil over me, and so hide sky\r\n      and sun, grass and green tree; taking me entirely to her death-cold bosom,\r\n      and holding me with arms of bone. What tales she would tell me at such\r\n      hours! What songs she would recite in my ears! How she would discourse to\r\n      me of her own country\u2014the grave\u2014and again and again promise to\r\n      conduct me there ere long; and, drawing me to the very brink of a black,\r\n      sullen river, show me, on the other side, shores unequal with mound,\r\n      monument, and tablet, standing up in a glimmer more hoary than moonlight.\r\n      \u201cNecropolis!\u201d she would whisper, pointing to the pale piles, and add, \u201cIt\r\n      contains a mansion prepared for you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      But my boyhood was lonely, parentless; uncheered by brother or sister; and\r\n      there was no marvel that, just as I rose to youth, a sorceress, finding me\r\n      lost in vague mental wanderings, with many affections and few objects,\r\n      glowing aspirations and gloomy prospects, strong desires and slender\r\n      hopes, should lift up her illusive lamp to me in the distance, and lure me\r\n      to her vaulted home of horrors. No wonder her spells then had\r\n      power; but now, when my course was widening, my prospect\r\n      brightening; when my affections had found a rest; when my desires, folding\r\n      wings, weary with long flight, had just alighted on the very lap of\r\n      fruition, and nestled there warm, content, under the caress of a soft\r\n      hand\u2014why did hypochondria accost me now?\r\n    \n\r\n      I repulsed her as one would a dreaded and ghastly concubine coming to\r\n      embitter a husband\u2019s heart toward his young bride; in vain; she kept her\r\n      sway over me for that night and the next day, and eight succeeding days.\r\n      Afterwards, my spirits began slowly to recover their tone; my appetite\r\n      returned, and in a fortnight I was well. I had gone about as usual all the\r\n      time, and had said nothing to anybody of what I felt; but I was glad when\r\n      the evil spirit departed from me, and I could again seek Frances, and sit\r\n      at her side, freed from the dreadful tyranny of my demon.\r\n    \n"}
{"24": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n    \n\r\n      ONE fine, frosty Sunday in November, Frances and I took a long walk; we\r\n      made the tour of the city by the Boulevards; and, afterwards, Frances\r\n      being a little tired, we sat down on one of those wayside seats placed\r\n      under the trees, at intervals, for the accommodation of the weary. Frances\r\n      was telling me about Switzerland; the subject animated her; and I was just\r\n      thinking that her eyes spoke full as eloquently as her tongue, when she\r\n      stopped and remarked\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, there is a gentleman who knows you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I looked up; three fashionably dressed men were just then\r\n      passing\u2014Englishmen, I knew by their air and gait as well as by their\r\n      features; in the tallest of the trio I at once recognized Mr. Hunsden; he\r\n      was in the act of lifting his hat to Frances; afterwards, he made a\r\n      grimace at me, and passed on.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWho is he?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cA person I knew in England.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy did he bow to me? He does not know me.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, he does know you, in his way.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHow, monsieur?\u201d (She still called me \u201cmonsieur\u201d; I could not persuade her\r\n      to adopt any more familiar term.)\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDid you not read the expression of his eyes?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOf his eyes? No. What did they say?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cTo you they said, \u2018How do you do, Wilhelmina Crimsworth?\u2019 To me, \u2018So you\r\n      have found your counterpart at last; there she sits, the female of your\r\n      kind!\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, you could not read all that in his eyes; he was so soon gone.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI read that and more, Frances; I read that he will probably call on me\r\n      this evening, or on some future occasion shortly; and I have no doubt he\r\n      will insist on being introduced to you; shall I bring him to your rooms?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIf you please, monsieur\u2014I have no objection; I think, indeed, I\r\n      should rather like to see him nearer; he looks so original.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      As I had anticipated, Mr. Hunsden came that evening. The first thing he\r\n      said was:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou need not begin boasting, Monsieur le Professeur; I know about your\r\n      appointment to \u2014\u2014 College, and all that; Brown has told me.\u201d\r\n       Then he intimated that he had returned from Germany but a day or two\r\n      since; afterwards, he abruptly demanded whether that was Madame\r\n      Pelet-Reuter with whom he had seen me on the Boulevards. I was going to\r\n      utter a rather emphatic negative, but on second thoughts I checked myself,\r\n      and, seeming to assent, asked what he thought of her?\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAs to her, I\u2019ll come to that directly; but first I\u2019ve a word for you. I\r\n      see you are a scoundrel; you\u2019ve no business to be promenading about with\r\n      another man\u2019s wife. I thought you had sounder sense than to get mixed up\r\n      in foreign hodge-podge of this sort.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut the lady?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cShe\u2019s too good for you evidently; she is like you, but something better\r\n      than you\u2014no beauty, though; yet when she rose (for I looked back to\r\n      see you both walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good. These\r\n      foreigners understand grace. What the devil has she done with Pelet? She\r\n      has not been married to him three months\u2014he must be a spoon!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I would not let the mistake go too far; I did not like it much.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cPelet? How your head runs on Mons. and Madame Pelet! You are always\r\n      talking about them. I wish to the gods you had wed Mdlle. Zora\u00efde\r\n      yourself!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWas that young gentlewoman not Mdlle. Zora\u00efde?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo; nor Madame Zora\u00efde either.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy did you tell a lie, then?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI told no lie; but you are is such a hurry. She is a pupil of mine\u2014a\r\n      Swiss girl.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd of course you are going to be married to her? Don\u2019t deny that.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMarried! I think I shall\u2014if Fate spares us both ten weeks longer.\r\n      That is my little wild strawberry, Hunsden, whose sweetness made me\r\n      careless of your hothouse grapes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cStop! No boasting\u2014no heroics; I won\u2019t hear them. What is she? To\r\n      what caste does she belong?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I smiled. Hunsden unconsciously laid stress on the word caste,\r\n      and, in fact, republican, lord-hater as he was, Hunsden was as proud of\r\n      his old \u2014\u2014shire blood, of his descent and family standing, respectable\r\n      and respected through long generations back, as any peer in the realm of\r\n      his Norman race and Conquest-dated title. Hunsden would as little have\r\n      thought of taking a wife from a caste inferior to his own, as a\r\n      Stanley would think of mating with a Cobden. I enjoyed the surprise I\r\n      should give; I enjoyed the triumph of my practice over his theory; and\r\n      leaning over the table, and uttering the words slowly but with repressed\r\n      glee, I said concisely\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cShe is a lace-mender.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden examined me. He did not say he was surprised, but\r\n      surprised he was; he had his own notions of good breeding. I saw he\r\n      suspected I was going to take some very rash step; but repressing\r\n      declamation or remonstrance, he only answered\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell, you are the best judge of your own affairs. A lace-mender may make\r\n      a good wife as well as a lady; but of course you have taken care to\r\n      ascertain thoroughly that since she has not education, fortune or station,\r\n      she is well furnished with such natural qualities as you think most likely\r\n      to conduce to your happiness. Has she many relations?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNone in Brussels.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat is better. Relations are often the real evil in such cases. I cannot\r\n      but think that a train of inferior connections would have been a bore to\r\n      you to your life\u2019s end.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      After sitting in silence a little while longer, Hunsden rose, and was\r\n      quietly bidding me good evening; the polite, considerate manner in which\r\n      he offered me his hand (a thing he had never done before), convinced me\r\n      that he thought I had made a terrible fool of myself; and that, ruined and\r\n      thrown away as I was, it was no time for sarcasm or cynicism, or indeed\r\n      for anything but indulgence and forbearance.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cGood night, William,\u201d he said, in a really soft voice, while his face\r\n      looked benevolently compassionate. \u201cGood night, lad. I wish you and your\r\n      future wife much prosperity; and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious\r\n      soul.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I had much ado to refrain from laughing as I beheld the magnanimous pity\r\n      of his mien; maintaining, however, a grave air, I said:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI thought you would have liked to have seen Mdlle. Henri?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOh, that is the name! Yes\u2014if it would be convenient, I should like\r\n      to see her\u2014but\u2014\u2014.\u201d He hesitated.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should on no account wish to intrude.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCome, then,\u201d said I. We set out. Hunsden no doubt regarded me as a rash,\r\n      imprudent man, thus to show my poor little grisette sweetheart, in her\r\n      poor little unfurnished grenier; but he prepared to act the real\r\n      gentleman, having, in fact, the kernel of that character, under the harsh\r\n      husk it pleased him to wear by way of mental mackintosh. He talked\r\n      affably, and even gently, as we went along the street; he had never been\r\n      so civil to me in his life. We reached the house, entered, ascended the\r\n      stair; on gaining the lobby, Hunsden turned to mount a narrower stair\r\n      which led to a higher story; I saw his mind was bent on the attics.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHere, Mr. Hunsden,\u201d said I quietly, tapping at Frances\u2019 door. He turned;\r\n      in his genuine politeness he was a little disconcerted at having made the\r\n      mistake; his eye reverted to the green mat, but he said nothing.\r\n    \n\r\n      We walked in, and Frances rose from her seat near the table to receive us;\r\n      her mourning attire gave her a recluse, rather conventual, but withal very\r\n      distinguished look; its grave simplicity added nothing to beauty, but much\r\n      to dignity; the finish of the white collar and manchettes sufficed for a\r\n      relief to the merino gown of solemn black; ornament was forsworn. Frances\r\n      curtsied with sedate grace, looking, as she always did, when one first\r\n      accosted her, more a woman to respect than to love; I introduced Mr.\r\n      Hunsden, and she expressed her happiness at making his acquaintance in\r\n      French. The pure and polished accent, the low yet sweet and rather full\r\n      voice, produced their effect immediately; Hunsden spoke French in reply; I\r\n      had not heard him speak that language before; he managed it very well. I\r\n      retired to the window-seat; Mr. Hunsden, at his hostess\u2019s invitation,\r\n      occupied a chair near the hearth; from my position I could see them both,\r\n      and the room too, at a glance. The room was so clean and bright, it looked\r\n      like a little polished cabinet; a glass filled with flowers in the centre\r\n      of the table, a fresh rose in each china cup on the mantelpiece gave it an\r\n      air of f\u00eate. Frances was serious, and Mr. Hunsden\r\n      subdued, but both\r\n      mutually polite; they got on at the French swimmingly: ordinary topics\r\n      were discussed with great state and decorum; I thought I had never seen\r\n      two such models of propriety, for Hunsden (thanks to the constraint of the\r\n      foreign tongue) was obliged to shape his phrases, and measure his\r\n      sentences, with a care that forbade any eccentricity. At last England was\r\n      mentioned, and Frances proceeded to ask questions. Animated by degrees,\r\n      she began to change, just as a grave night-sky changes at the approach of\r\n      sunrise: first it seemed as if her forehead cleared, then her eyes\r\n      glittered, her features relaxed, and became quite mobile; her subdued\r\n      complexion grew warm and transparent; to me, she now looked pretty;\r\n      before, she had only looked ladylike.\r\n    \n\r\n      She had many things to say to the Englishman just fresh from his\r\n      island-country, and she urged him with an enthusiasm of curiosity, which\r\n      ere long thawed Hunsden\u2019s reserve as fire thaws a congealed viper. I use\r\n      this not very flattering comparison because he vividly reminded me of a\r\n      snake waking from torpor, as he erected his tall form, reared his head,\r\n      before a little declined, and putting back his hair from his broad Saxon\r\n      forehead, showed unshaded the gleam of almost savage satire which his\r\n      interlocutor\u2019s tone of eagerness and look of ardour had sufficed at once\r\n      to kindle in his soul and elicit from his eyes: he was himself; as Frances\r\n      was herself, and in none but his own language would he now address her.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou understand English?\u201d was the prefatory question.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cA little.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, you shall have plenty of it; and first, I see you\u2019ve not much\r\n      more sense than some others of my acquaintance\u201d (indicating me with his\r\n      thumb), \u201cor else you\u2019d never turn rabid about that dirty little country\r\n      called England; for rabid, I see you are; I read Anglophobia in your\r\n      looks, and hear it in your words. Why, mademoiselle, is it possible that\r\n      anybody with a grain of rationality should feel enthusiasm about a mere\r\n      name, and that name England? I thought you were a lady-abbess five minutes\r\n      ago, and respected you accordingly; and now I see you are a sort of Swiss\r\n      sibyl, with high Tory and high Church principles!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cEngland is your country?\u201d asked Frances.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd you don\u2019t like it?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019d be sorry to like it! A little corrupt, venal, lord-and-king-cursed\r\n      nation, full of mucky pride (as they say in \u2014\u2014shire), and\r\n      helpless pauperism; rotten with abuses, worm-eaten with prejudices!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou might say so of almost every state; there are abuses and prejudices\r\n      everywhere, and I thought fewer in England than in other countries.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCome to England and see. Come to Birmingham and Manchester; come to St.\r\n      Giles\u2019 in London, and get a practical notion of how our system works.\r\n      Examine the footprints of our august aristocracy; see how they walk in\r\n      blood, crushing hearts as they go. Just put your head in at English\r\n      cottage doors; get a glimpse of Famine crouched torpid on black\r\n      hearthstones; of Disease lying bare on beds without coverlets, of Infamy\r\n      wantoning viciously with Ignorance, though indeed Luxury is her favourite\r\n      paramour, and princely halls are dearer to her than thatched hovels\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI was not thinking of the wretchedness and vice in England; I was\r\n      thinking of the good side\u2014of what is elevated in your character as a\r\n      nation.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere is no good side\u2014none at least of which you can have any\r\n      knowledge; for you cannot appreciate the efforts of industry, the\r\n      achievements of enterprise, or the discoveries of science: narrowness of\r\n      education and obscurity of position quite incapacitate you from\r\n      understanding these points; and as to historical and poetical\r\n      associations, I will not insult you, mademoiselle, by supposing that you\r\n      alluded to such humbug.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBut I did partly.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden laughed\u2014his laugh of unmitigated scorn.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI did, Mr. Hunsden. Are you of the number of those to whom such\r\n      associations give no pleasure?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, what is an association? I never saw one. What is its\r\n      length, breadth, weight, value\u2014ay, value? What price will it\r\n      bring in the market?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour portrait, to any one who loved you, would, for the sake of\r\n      association, be without price.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      That inscrutable Hunsden heard this remark and felt it rather acutely,\r\n      too, somewhere; for he coloured\u2014a thing not unusual with him, when\r\n      hit unawares on a tender point. A sort of trouble momentarily darkened his\r\n      eye, and I believe he filled up the transient pause succeeding his\r\n      antagonist\u2019s home-thrust, by a wish that some one did love him as he would\r\n      like to be loved\u2014some one whose love he could unreservedly return.\r\n    \n\r\n      The lady pursued her temporary advantage.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIf your world is a world without associations, Mr. Hunsden, I no longer\r\n      wonder that you hate England so. I don\u2019t clearly know what Paradise is,\r\n      and what angels are; yet taking it to be the most glorious region I can\r\n      conceive, and angels the most elevated existences\u2014if one of them\u2014if\r\n      Abdiel the Faithful himself\u201d (she was thinking of Milton) \u201cwere suddenly\r\n      stripped of the faculty of association, I think he would soon rush forth\r\n      from \u2018the ever-during gates,\u2019 leave heaven, and seek what he had lost in\r\n      hell. Yes, in the very hell from which he turned \u2018with retorted scorn.\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Frances\u2019 tone in saying this was as marked as her language, and it was\r\n      when the word \u201chell\u201d twanged off from her lips, with a somewhat startling\r\n      emphasis, that Hunsden deigned to bestow one slight glance of admiration.\r\n      He liked something strong, whether in man or woman; he liked whatever\r\n      dared to clear conventional limits. He had never before heard a lady say\r\n      \u201chell\u201d with that uncompromising sort of accent, and the sound pleased him\r\n      from a lady\u2019s lips; he would fain have had Frances to strike the string\r\n      again, but it was not in her way. The display of eccentric vigour never\r\n      gave her pleasure, and it only sounded in her voice or flashed in her\r\n      countenance when extraordinary circumstances\u2014and those generally\r\n      painful\u2014forced it out of the depths where it burned latent. To me,\r\n      once or twice, she had in intimate conversation, uttered venturous\r\n      thoughts in nervous language; but when the hour of such manifestation was\r\n      past, I could not recall it; it came of itself and of itself departed.\r\n      Hunsden\u2019s excitations she put by soon with a smile, and recurring to the\r\n      theme of disputation, said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSince England is nothing, why do the continental nations respect her so?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should have thought no child would have asked that question,\u201d replied\r\n      Hunsden, who never at any time gave information without reproving for\r\n      stupidity those who asked it of him. \u201cIf you had been my pupil, as I\r\n      suppose you once had the misfortune to be that of a deplorable character\r\n      not a hundred miles off, I would have put you in the corner for such a\r\n      confession of ignorance. Why, mademoiselle, can\u2019t you see that it is our\r\n      gold which buys us French politeness, German good-will, and Swiss\r\n      servility?\u201d And he sneered diabolically.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cSwiss?\u201d said Frances, catching the word \u201cservility.\u201d \u201cDo you call my\r\n      countrymen servile?\u201d and she started up. I could not suppress a low laugh;\r\n      there was ire in her glance and defiance in her attitude. \u201cDo you abuse\r\n      Switzerland to me, Mr. Hunsden? Do you think I have no associations? Do\r\n      you calculate that I am prepared to dwell only on what vice and\r\n      degradation may be found in Alpine villages, and to leave quite out of my\r\n      heart the social greatness of my countrymen, and our blood-earned freedom,\r\n      and the natural glories of our mountains? You\u2019re mistaken\u2014you\u2019re\r\n      mistaken.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSocial greatness? Call it what you will, your countrymen are sensible\r\n      fellows; they make a marketable article of what to you is an abstract\r\n      idea; they have, ere this, sold their social greatness and also their\r\n      blood-earned freedom to be the servants of foreign kings.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou never were in Switzerland?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014I have been there twice.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou know nothing of it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI do.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd you say the Swiss are mercenary, as a parrot says \u2018Poor Poll,\u2019 or as\r\n      the Belgians here say the English are not brave, or as the French accuse\r\n      them of being perfidious: there is no justice in your dictums.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere is truth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI tell you, Mr. Hunsden, you are a more unpractical man than I am an\r\n      unpractical woman, for you don\u2019t acknowledge what really exists; you want\r\n      to annihilate individual patriotism and national greatness as an atheist\r\n      would annihilate God and his own soul, by denying their existence.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhere are you flying to? You are off at a tangent\u2014I thought we were\r\n      talking about the mercenary nature of the Swiss.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWe were\u2014and if you proved to me that the Swiss are mercenary\r\n      to-morrow (which you cannot do) I should love Switzerland still.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou would be mad, then\u2014mad as a March hare\u2014to indulge in a\r\n      passion for millions of shiploads of soil, timber, snow, and ice.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot so mad as you who love nothing.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s a method in my madness; there\u2019s none in yours.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYour method is to squeeze the sap out of creation and make manure of the\r\n      refuse, by way of turning it to what you call use.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou cannot reason at all,\u201d said Hunsden; \u201cthere is no logic in you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBetter to be without logic than without feeling,\u201d retorted Frances, who\r\n      was now passing backwards and forwards from her cupboard to the table,\r\n      intent, if not on hospitable thoughts, at least on hospitable deeds, for\r\n      she was laying the cloth, and putting plates, knives and forks thereon.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cIs that a hit at me, mademoiselle? Do you suppose I am without feeling?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI suppose you are always interfering with your own feelings, and those of\r\n      other people, and dogmatizing about the irrationality of this, that, and\r\n      the other sentiment, and then ordering it to be suppressed because you\r\n      imagine it to be inconsistent with logic.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI do right.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Frances had stepped out of sight into a sort of little pantry; she soon\r\n      reappeared.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou do right? Indeed, no! You are much mistaken if you think so. Just be\r\n      so good as to let me get to the fire, Mr. Hunsden; I have something to\r\n      cook.\u201d (An interval occupied in settling a casserole on the fire; then,\r\n      while she stirred its contents:) \u201cRight! as if it were right to crush any\r\n      pleasurable sentiment that God has given to man, especially any sentiment\r\n      that, like patriotism, spreads man\u2019s selfishness in wider circles\u201d (fire\r\n      stirred, dish put down before it).\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWere you born in Switzerland?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should think so, or else why should I call it my country?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd where did you get your English features and figure?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI am English, too; half the blood in my veins is English; thus I have a\r\n      right to a double power of patriotism, possessing an interest in two\r\n      noble, free, and fortunate countries.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou had an English mother?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes; and you, I suppose, had a mother from the moon or from Utopia,\r\n      since not a nation in Europe has a claim on your interest?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m a universal patriot, if you could understand me\r\n      rightly: my country is the world.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSympathies so widely diffused must be very shallow: will you have the\r\n      goodness to come to table. Monsieur\u201d (to me who appeared to be now\r\n      absorbed in reading by moonlight)\u2014\u201cMonsieur, supper is served.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      This was said in quite a different voice to that in which she had been\r\n      bandying phrases with Mr. Hunsden\u2014not so short, graver and softer.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cFrances, what do you mean by preparing, supper? we had no intention of\r\n      staying.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAh, monsieur, but you have stayed, and supper is prepared; you have only\r\n      the alternative of eating it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The meal was a foreign one, of course; it consisted in two small but tasty\r\n      dishes of meat prepared with skill and served with nicety; a salad and\r\n      \u201cfromage Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d completed it. The business of eating interposed a\r\n      brief truce between the belligerents, but no sooner was supper disposed of\r\n      than they were at it again. The fresh subject of dispute ran on the spirit\r\n      of religious intolerance which Mr. Hunsden affirmed to exist strongly in\r\n      Switzerland, notwithstanding the professed attachment of the Swiss to\r\n      freedom. Here Frances had greatly the worst of it, not only because she\r\n      was unskilled to argue, but because her own real opinions on the point in\r\n      question happened to coincide pretty nearly with Mr. Hunsden\u2019s, and she\r\n      only contradicted him out of opposition. At last she gave in, confessing\r\n      that she thought as he thought, but bidding him take notice that she did\r\n      not consider herself beaten.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo more did the French at Waterloo,\u201d said Hunsden.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere is no comparison between the cases,\u201d rejoined Frances; \u201cmine was a\r\n      sham fight.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cSham or real, it\u2019s up with you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo; though I have neither logic nor wealth of words, yet in a case where\r\n      my opinion really differed from yours, I would adhere to it when I had not\r\n      another word to say in its defence; you should be baffled by dumb\r\n      determination. You speak of Waterloo; your Wellington ought to have been\r\n      conquered there, according to Napoleon; but he persevered in spite of the\r\n      laws of war, and was victorious in defiance of military tactics. I would\r\n      do as he did.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll be bound for it you would; probably you have some of the same sort\r\n      of stubborn stuff in you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should be sorry if I had not; he and Tell were brothers, and I\u2019d scorn\r\n      the Swiss, man or woman, who had none of the much-enduring nature of our\r\n      heroic William in his soul.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIf Tell was like Wellington, he was an ass.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cDoes not ass mean baudet?\u201d asked Frances, turning to\r\n      me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied I, \u201cit means an esprit-fort; and now,\u201d\r\n      I continued, as I saw that fresh occasion of strife was brewing between\r\n      these two, \u201cit is high time to go.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden rose. \u201cGood bye,\u201d said he to Frances; \u201cI shall be off for this\r\n      glorious England to-morrow, and it may be twelve months or more before I\r\n      come to Brussels again; whenever I do come I\u2019ll seek you out, and you\r\n      shall see if I don\u2019t find means to make you fiercer than a dragon. You\u2019ve\r\n      done pretty well this evening, but next interview you shall challenge me\r\n      outright. Meantime you\u2019re doomed to become Mrs. William Crimsworth, I\r\n      suppose; poor young lady? but you have a spark of spirit; cherish it, and\r\n      give the Professor the full benefit thereof.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAre you married, Mr. Hunsden?\u201d asked Frances, suddenly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cNo. I should have thought you might have guessed I was a Benedict by my\r\n      look.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, whenever you marry don\u2019t take a wife out of Switzerland; for if you\r\n      begin blaspheming Helvetia, and cursing the cantons\u2014above all, if\r\n      you mention the word ass in the same breath with the name Tell\r\n      (for ass is baudet, I know; though Monsieur is pleased to\r\n      translate it esprit-fort) your mountain maid will some\r\n      night smother her Breton-bretonnant, even as your own Shakspeare\u2019s Othello\r\n      smothered Desdemona.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI am warned,\u201d said Hunsden; \u201cand so are you, lad,\u201d (nodding to me). \u201cI\r\n      hope yet to hear of a travesty of the Moor and his gentle lady, in which\r\n      the parts shall be reversed according to the plan just sketched\u2014you,\r\n      however, being in my nightcap. Farewell, mademoiselle!\u201d He bowed on her\r\n      hand, absolutely like Sir Charles Grandison on that of Harriet Byron;\r\n      adding\u2014\u201cDeath from such fingers would not be without charms.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMon Dieu!\u201d murmured Frances, opening her large eyes and lifting her\r\n      distinctly arched brows; \u201cc\u2019est qu\u2019il fait des compliments! je ne m\u2019y suis\r\n      pas attendu.\u201d She smiled, half in ire, half in mirth, curtsied with\r\n      foreign grace, and so they parted.\r\n    \n\r\n      No sooner had we got into the street than Hunsden collared me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cAnd that is your lace-mender?\u201d said he; \u201cand you reckon you have done a\r\n      fine, magnanimous thing in offering to marry her? You, a scion of\r\n      Seacombe, have proved your disdain of social distinctions by taking up\r\n      with an ouvri\u00e8re! And I pitied the fellow, thinking his\r\n      feelings had misled him, and that he had hurt himself by contracting a low\r\n      match!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cJust let go my collar, Hunsden.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      On the contrary, he swayed me to and fro; so I grappled him round the\r\n      waist. It was dark; the street lonely and lampless. We had then a tug for\r\n      it; and after we had both rolled on the pavement, and with difficulty\r\n      picked ourselves up, we agreed to walk on more soberly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYes, that\u2019s my lace-mender,\u201d said I; \u201cand she is to be mine for life\u2014God\r\n      willing.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cGod is not willing\u2014you can\u2019t suppose it; what business have you to\r\n      be suited so well with a partner? And she treats you with a sort of\r\n      respect, too, and says, \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and modulates her tone in addressing\r\n      you, actually, as if you were something superior! She could not evince\r\n      more deference to such a one as I, were she favoured by fortune to the\r\n      supreme extent of being my choice instead of yours.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cHunsden, you\u2019re a puppy. But you\u2019ve only seen the title-page of my\r\n      happiness; you don\u2019t know the tale that follows; you cannot conceive the\r\n      interest and sweet variety and thrilling excitement of the narrative.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Hunsden\u2014speaking low and deep, for we had now entered a busier\r\n      street\u2014desired me to hold my peace, threatening to do something\r\n      dreadful if I stimulated his wrath further by boasting. I laughed till my\r\n      sides ached. We soon reached his hotel; before he entered it, he said\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t be vainglorious. Your lace-mender is too good for you, but not good\r\n      enough for me; neither physically nor morally does she come up to my ideal\r\n      of a woman. No; I dream of something far beyond that pale-faced, excitable\r\n      little Helvetian (by-the-by she has infinitely more of the nervous, mobile\r\n      Parisienne in her than of the the robust \u2018jungfrau\u2019). Your Mdlle. Henri is\r\n      in person ch\u00e9tive, in mind\r\n      sans caract\u00e8re, compared with the queen of my visions.\r\n      You, indeed, may put up with that minois chiffon\u00e9; but\r\n      when I marry I must have straighter and more harmonious features, to say\r\n      nothing of a nobler and better developed shape than that perverse,\r\n      ill-thriven child can boast.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cBribe a seraph to fetch you a coal of fire from heaven, if you will,\u201d\r\n       said I, \u201cand with it kindle life in the tallest, fattest, most boneless,\r\n      fullest-blooded of Ruben\u2019s painted women\u2014leave me only my Alpine\r\n      peri, and I\u2019ll not envy you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      With a simultaneous movement, each turned his back on the other. Neither\r\n      said \u201cGod bless you;\u201d yet on the morrow the sea was to roll between us.\r\n    \n"}
{"25": "\n\n\n \n\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXV.\r\n    \n\r\n      IN two months more Frances had fulfilled the time of mourning for her\r\n      aunt. One January morning\u2014the first of the new year holidays\u2014I\r\n      went in a fiacre, accompanied only by M. Vandenhuten, to the Rue Notre\r\n      Dame aux Neiges, and having alighted alone and walked upstairs, I found\r\n      Frances apparently waiting for me, dressed in a style scarcely appropriate\r\n      to that cold, bright, frosty day. Never till now had I seen her attired in\r\n      any other than black or sad-coloured stuff; and there she stood by the\r\n      window, clad all in white, and white of a most diaphanous texture; her\r\n      array was very simple, to be sure, but it looked imposing and festal\r\n      because it was so clear, full, and floating; a veil shadowed her head, and\r\n      hung below her knee; a little wreath of pink flowers fastened it to her\r\n      thickly tressed Grecian plait, and thence it fell softly on each side of\r\n      her face. Singular to state, she was, or had been crying; when I asked her\r\n      if she were ready, she said \u201cYes, monsieur,\u201d with something very like a\r\n      checked sob; and when I took a shawl, which lay on the table, and folded\r\n      it round her, not only did tear after tear course unbidden down her cheek,\r\n      but she shook to my ministration like a reed. I said I was sorry to see\r\n      her in such low spirits, and requested to be allowed an insight into the\r\n      origin thereof. She only said, \u201cIt was impossible to help it,\u201d and then\r\n      voluntarily, though hurriedly, putting her hand into mine, accompanied me\r\n      out of the room, and ran downstairs with a quick, uncertain step, like one\r\n      who was eager to get some formidable piece of business over. I put her\r\n      into the fiacre. M. Vandenhuten received her, and seated her beside\r\n      himself; we drove all together to the Protestant chapel, went through a\r\n      certain service in the Common Prayer Book, and she and I came out married.\r\n      M. Vandenhuten had given the bride away.\r\n    \n\r\n      We took no bridal trip; our modesty, screened by the peaceful obscurity of\r\n      our station, and the pleasant isolation of our circumstances, did not\r\n      exact that additional precaution. We repaired at once to a small house I\r\n      had taken in the faubourg nearest to that part of the city where the scene\r\n      of our avocations lay.\r\n    \n\r\n      Three or four hours after the wedding ceremony, Frances, divested of her\r\n      bridal snow, and attired in a pretty lilac gown of warmer materials, a\r\n      piquant black silk apron, and a lace collar with some finishing decoration\r\n      of lilac ribbon, was kneeling on the carpet of a neatly furnished though\r\n      not spacious parlour, arranging on the shelves of a chiffoni\u00e8re some\r\n      books, which I handed to her from the table. It was snowing fast out of\r\n      doors; the afternoon had turned out wild and cold; the leaden sky seemed\r\n      full of drifts, and the street was already ankle-deep in the white\r\n      downfall. Our fire burned bright, our new habitation looked brilliantly\r\n      clean and fresh, the furniture was all arranged, and there were but some\r\n      articles of glass, china, books, &c., to put in order. Frances found\r\n      in this business occupation till tea-time, and then, after I had\r\n      distinctly instructed her how to make a cup of tea in rational English\r\n      style, and after she had got over the dismay occasioned by seeing such an\r\n      extravagant amount of material put into the pot, she administered to me a\r\n      proper British repast, at which there wanted neither candles nor urn,\r\n      firelight nor comfort.\r\n    \n\r\n      Our week\u2019s holiday glided by, and we readdressed ourselves to labour. Both\r\n      my wife and I began in good earnest with the notion that we were working\r\n      people, destined to earn our bread by exertion, and that of the most\r\n      assiduous kind. Our days were thoroughly occupied; we used to part every\r\n      morning at eight o\u2019clock, and not meet again till five P.M.; but into what\r\n      sweet rest did the turmoil of each busy day decline! Looking down the\r\n      vista of memory, I see the evenings passed in that little parlour like a\r\n      long string of rubies circling the dusky brow of the past. Unvaried were\r\n      they as each cut gem, and like each gem brilliant and burning.\r\n    \n\r\n      A year and a half passed. One morning (it was a f\u00eate, and\r\n      we had the day to ourselves) Frances said to me, with a suddenness\r\n      peculiar to her when she had been thinking long on a subject, and at last,\r\n      having come to a conclusion, wished to test its soundness by the\r\n      touchstone of my judgment:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t work enough.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat now?\u201d demanded I, looking up from my coffee, which I had been\r\n      deliberately stirring while enjoying, in anticipation, a walk I proposed\r\n      to take with Frances, that fine summer day (it was June), to a certain\r\n      farmhouse in the country, where we were to dine. \u201cWhat now?\u201d and I saw at\r\n      once, in the serious ardour of her face, a project of vital importance.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI am not satisfied,\u201d returned she; \u201cyou are now earning eight thousand\r\n      francs a year\u201d (it was true; my efforts, punctuality, the fame of my\r\n      pupils\u2019 progress, the publicity of my station, had so far helped me on),\r\n      \u201cwhile I am still at my miserable twelve hundred francs. I can do\r\n      better, and I will.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou work as long and as diligently as I do, Frances.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, monsieur, but I am not working in the right way, and I am convinced\r\n      of it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYou wish to change\u2014you have a plan for progress in your mind; go\r\n      and put on your bonnet; and, while we take our walk, you shall tell me of\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She went\u2014as docile as a well-trained child; she was a curious\r\n      mixture of tractability and firmness: I sat thinking about her, and\r\n      wondering what her plan could be, when she re-entered.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I have given Minnie\u201d (our bonne) \u201cleave to go out too, as it is\r\n      so very fine; so will you be kind enough to lock the door, and take the\r\n      key with you?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cKiss me, Mrs. Crimsworth,\u201d was my not very apposite reply; but she looked\r\n      so engaging in her light summer dress and little cottage bonnet, and her\r\n      manner in speaking to me was then, as always, so unaffectedly and suavely\r\n      respectful, that my heart expanded at the sight of her, and a kiss seemed\r\n      necessary to content its importunity.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThere, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you always call me \u2018Monsieur\u2019? Say, \u2018William.\u2019\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI cannot pronounce your W; besides, \u2018Monsieur\u2019 belongs to you; I like it\r\n      best.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Minnie having departed in clean cap and smart shawl, we, too, set out,\r\n      leaving the house solitary and silent\u2014silent, at least, but for the\r\n      ticking of the clock. We were soon clear of Brussels; the fields received\r\n      us, and then the lanes, remote from carriage-resounding\r\n      chauss\u00e9es. Ere\r\n      long we came upon a nook, so rural, green, and secluded, it might have\r\n      been a spot in some pastoral English province; a bank of short and mossy\r\n      grass, under a hawthorn, offered a seat too tempting to be declined; we\r\n      took it, and when we had admired and examined some English-looking\r\n      wild-flowers growing at our feet, I recalled Frances\u2019 attention and my own\r\n      to the topic touched on at breakfast.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat was her plan?\u201d A natural one\u2014the next step to be mounted by\r\n      us, or, at least, by her, if she wanted to rise in her profession. She\r\n      proposed to begin a school. We already had the means for commencing on a\r\n      careful scale, having lived greatly within our income. We possessed, too,\r\n      by this time, an extensive and eligible connection, in the sense\r\n      advantageous to our business; for, though our circle of visiting\r\n      acquaintance continued as limited as ever, we were now widely known in\r\n      schools and families as teachers. When Frances had developed her plan, she\r\n      intimated, in some closing sentences, her hopes for the future. If we only\r\n      had good health and tolerable success, me might, she was sure, in time\r\n      realize an independency; and that, perhaps, before we were too old to\r\n      enjoy it; then both she and I would rest; and what was to hinder us from\r\n      going to live in England? England was still her Promised Land.\r\n    \n\r\n      I put no obstacle in her way; raised no objection; I knew she was not one\r\n      who could live quiescent and inactive, or even comparatively inactive.\r\n      Duties she must have to fulfil, and important duties; work to do\u2014and\r\n      exciting, absorbing, profitable work; strong faculties stirred in her\r\n      frame, and they demanded full nourishment, free exercise: mine was not the\r\n      hand ever to starve or cramp them; no, I delighted in offering them\r\n      sustenance, and in clearing them wider space for action.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou have conceived a plan, Frances,\u201d said I, \u201cand a good plan; execute\r\n      it; you have my free consent, and wherever and whenever my assistance is\r\n      wanted, ask and you shall have.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Frances\u2019 eyes thanked me almost with tears; just a sparkle or two, soon\r\n      brushed away; she possessed herself of my hand too, and held it for some\r\n      time very close clasped in both her own, but she said no more than \u201cThank\r\n      you, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      We passed a divine day, and came home late, lighted by a full summer moon.\r\n    \n\r\n      Ten years rushed now upon me with dusty, vibrating, unresting wings; years\r\n      of bustle, action, unslacked endeavour; years in which I and my wife,\r\n      having launched ourselves in the full career of progress, as progress\r\n      whirls on in European capitals, scarcely knew repose, were strangers to\r\n      amusement, never thought of indulgence, and yet, as our course ran side by\r\n      side, as we marched hand in hand, we neither murmured, repented, nor\r\n      faltered. Hope indeed cheered us; health kept us up; harmony of thought\r\n      and deed smoothed many difficulties, and finally, success bestowed every\r\n      now and then encouraging reward on diligence. Our school became one of the\r\n      most popular in Brussels, and as by degrees we raised our terms and\r\n      elevated our system of education, our choice of pupils grew more select,\r\n      and at length included the children of the best families in Belgium. We\r\n      had too an excellent connection in England, first opened by the\r\n      unsolicited recommendation of Mr. Hunsden, who having been over, and\r\n      having abused me for my prosperity in set terms, went back, and soon after\r\n      sent a leash of young \u2014\u2014shire heiresses\u2014his cousins; as\r\n      he said \u201cto be polished off by Mrs. Crimsworth.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      As to this same Mrs. Crimsworth, in one sense she was become another\r\n      woman, though in another she remained unchanged. So different was she\r\n      under different circumstances. I seemed to possess two wives. The\r\n      faculties of her nature, already disclosed when I married her, remained\r\n      fresh and fair; but other faculties shot up strong, branched out broad,\r\n      and quite altered the external character of the plant. Firmness, activity,\r\n      and enterprise, covered with grave foliage, poetic feeling and fervour;\r\n      but these flowers were still there, preserved pure and dewy under the\r\n      umbrage of later growth and hardier nature: perhaps I only in the world\r\n      knew the secret of their existence, but to me they were ever ready to\r\n      yield an exquisite fragrance and present a beauty as chaste as radiant.\r\n    \n\r\n      In the daytime my house and establishment were conducted by Madame the\r\n      directress, a stately and elegant woman, bearing much anxious thought on\r\n      her large brow; much calculated dignity in her serious mien: immediately\r\n      after breakfast I used to part with this lady; I went to my college, she\r\n      to her schoolroom; returning for an hour in the course of the day, I found\r\n      her always in class, intently occupied; silence, industry, observance,\r\n      attending on her presence. When not actually teaching, she was overlooking\r\n      and guiding by eye and gesture; she then appeared vigilant and solicitous.\r\n      When communicating instruction, her aspect was more animated; she seemed\r\n      to feel a certain enjoyment in the occupation. The language in which she\r\n      addressed her pupils, though simple and unpretending, was never trite or\r\n      dry; she did not speak from routine formulas\u2014she made her own\r\n      phrases as she went on, and very nervous and impressive phrases they\r\n      frequently were; often, when elucidating favourite points of history, or\r\n      geography, she would wax genuinely eloquent in her earnestness. Her\r\n      pupils, or at least the elder and more intelligent amongst them,\r\n      recognized well the language of a superior mind; they felt too, and some\r\n      of them received the impression of elevated sentiments; there was little\r\n      fondling between mistress and girls, but some of Frances\u2019 pupils in time\r\n      learnt to love her sincerely, all of them beheld her with respect; her\r\n      general demeanour towards them was serious; sometimes benignant when they\r\n      pleased her with their progress and attention, always scrupulously refined\r\n      and considerate. In cases where reproof or punishment was called for she\r\n      was usually forbearing enough; but if any took advantage of that\r\n      forbearance, which sometimes happened, a sharp, sudden and lightning-like\r\n      severity taught the culprit the extent of the mistake committed. Sometimes\r\n      a gleam of tenderness softened her eyes and manner, but this was rare;\r\n      only when a pupil was sick, or when it pined after home, or in the case of\r\n      some little motherless child, or of one much poorer than its companions,\r\n      whose scanty wardrobe and mean appointments brought on it the contempt of\r\n      the jewelled young countesses and silk-clad misses. Over such feeble\r\n      fledglings the directress spread a wing of kindliest protection: it was to\r\n      their bedside she came at night to tuck them warmly in; it was after them\r\n      she looked in winter to see that they always had a comfortable seat by the\r\n      stove; it was they who by turns were summoned to the salon to receive some\r\n      little dole of cake or fruit\u2014to sit on a footstool at the fireside\u2014to\r\n      enjoy home comforts, and almost home liberty, for an evening together\u2014to\r\n      be spoken to gently and softly, comforted, encouraged, cherished\u2014and\r\n      when bedtime came, dismissed with a kiss of true tenderness. As to Julia\r\n      and Georgiana G\u2014\u2014, daughters of an English baronet, as to\r\n      Mdlle. Mathilde de \u2014\u2014, heiress of a Belgian count, and sundry\r\n      other children of patrician race, the directress was careful of them as of\r\n      the others, anxious for their progress, as for that of the rest\u2014but\r\n      it never seemed to enter her head to distinguish them by a mark of\r\n      preference; one girl of noble blood she loved dearly\u2014a young Irish\r\n      baroness\u2014lady Catherine \u2014\u2014; but it was for her\r\n      enthusiastic heart and clever head, for her generosity and her genius, the\r\n      title and rank went for nothing.\r\n    \n\r\n      My afternoons were spent also in college, with the exception of an hour\r\n      that my wife daily exacted of me for her establishment, and with which she\r\n      would not dispense. She said that I must spend that time amongst her\r\n      pupils to learn their characters, to be \u201cau courant\u201d\r\n      with everything that\r\n      was passing in the house, to become interested in what interested her, to\r\n      be able to give her my opinion on knotty points when she required it, and\r\n      this she did constantly, never allowing my interest in the pupils to fall\r\n      asleep, and never making any change of importance without my cognizance\r\n      and consent. She delighted to sit by me when I gave my lessons (lessons in\r\n      literature), her hands folded on her knee, the most fixedly attentive of\r\n      any present. She rarely addressed me in class; when she did it was with an\r\n      air of marked deference; it was her pleasure, her joy to make me still the\r\n      master in all things.\r\n    \n\r\n      At six o\u2019clock P.M. my daily labours ceased. I then came home, for my home\r\n      was my heaven; ever at that hour, as I entered our private sitting-room,\r\n      the lady-directress vanished from before my eyes, and Frances Henri, my\r\n      own little lace-mender, was magically restored to my arms; much\r\n      disappointed she would have been if her master had not been as constant to\r\n      the tryst as herself, and if his truthfull kiss had not been prompt to\r\n      answer her soft, \u201cBon soir, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Talk French to me she would, and many a punishment she has had for her\r\n      wilfulness. I fear the choice of chastisement must have been injudicious,\r\n      for instead of correcting the fault, it seemed to encourage its renewal.\r\n      Our evenings were our own; that recreation was necessary to refresh our\r\n      strength for the due discharge of our duties; sometimes we spent them all\r\n      in conversation, and my young Genevese, now that she was thoroughly\r\n      accustomed to her English professor, now that she loved him too absolutely\r\n      to fear him much, reposed in him a confidence so unlimited that topics of\r\n      conversation could no more be wanting with him than subjects for communion\r\n      with her own heart. In those moments, happy as a bird with its mate, she\r\n      would show me what she had of vivacity, of mirth, of originality in her\r\n      well-dowered nature. She would show, too, some stores of raillery, of\r\n      \u201cmalice,\u201d and would vex, tease, pique me sometimes about what she called\r\n      my \u201cbizarreries anglaises,\u201d my \u201ccaprices insulaires,\u201d with a wild and\r\n      witty wickedness that made a perfect white demon of her while it lasted.\r\n      This was rare, however, and the elfish freak was always short: sometimes\r\n      when driven a little hard in the war of words\u2014for her tongue did\r\n      ample justice to the pith, the point, the delicacy of her native French,\r\n      in which language she always attacked me\u2014I used to turn upon her\r\n      with my old decision, and arrest bodily the sprite that teased me. Vain\r\n      idea! no sooner had I grasped hand or arm than the elf was gone; the\r\n      provocative smile quenched in the expressive brown eyes, and a ray of\r\n      gentle homage shone under the lids in its place. I had seized a mere\r\n      vexing fairy, and found a submissive and supplicating little mortal woman\r\n      in my arms. Then I made her get a book, and read English to me for an hour\r\n      by way of penance. I frequently dosed her with Wordsworth in this way, and\r\n      Wordsworth steadied her soon; she had a difficulty in comprehending his\r\n      deep, serene, and sober mind; his language, too, was not facile to her;\r\n      she had to ask questions, to sue for explanations, to be like a child and\r\n      a novice, and to acknowledge me as her senior and director. Her instinct\r\n      instantly penetrated and possessed the meaning of more ardent and\r\n      imaginative writers. Byron excited her; Scott she loved; Wordsworth only\r\n      she puzzled at, wondered over, and hesitated to pronounce an opinion upon.\r\n    \n\r\n      But whether she read to me, or talked with me; whether she teased me in\r\n      French, or entreated me in English; whether she jested with wit, or\r\n      inquired with deference; narrated with interest, or listened with\r\n      attention; whether she smiled at me or on me, always\r\n      at nine o\u2019clock I was left abandoned.\r\n      She would extricate herself from my arms, quit my side,\r\n      take her lamp, and be gone. Her mission was upstairs; I have followed her\r\n      sometimes and watched her. First she opened the door of the dortoir (the\r\n      pupils\u2019 chamber), noiselessly she glided up the long room between the two\r\n      rows of white beds, surveyed all the sleepers; if any were wakeful,\r\n      especially if any were sad, spoke to them and soothed them; stood some\r\n      minutes to ascertain that all was safe and tranquil; trimmed the\r\n      watch-light which burned in the apartment all night, then withdrew,\r\n      closing the door behind her without sound. Thence she glided to our own\r\n      chamber; it had a little cabinet within; this she sought; there, too,\r\n      appeared a bed, but one, and that a very small one; her face (the night I\r\n      followed and observed her) changed as she approached this tiny couch; from\r\n      grave it warmed to earnest; she shaded with one hand the lamp she held in\r\n      the other; she bent above the pillow and hung over a child asleep; its\r\n      slumber (that evening at least, and usually, I believe) was sound and\r\n      calm; no tear wet its dark eyelashes; no fever heated its round cheek; no\r\n      ill dream discomposed its budding features. Frances gazed, she did not\r\n      smile, and yet the deepest delight filled, flushed her face; feeling\r\n      pleasurable, powerful, worked in her whole frame, which still was\r\n      motionless. I saw, indeed, her heart heave, her lips were a little apart,\r\n      her breathing grew somewhat hurried; the child smiled; then at last the\r\n      mother smiled too, and said in low soliloquy, \u201cGod bless my little son!\u201d\r\n       She stooped closer over him, breathed the softest of kisses on his brow,\r\n      covered his minute hand with hers, and at last started up and came away. I\r\n      regained the parlour before her. Entering it two minutes later she said\r\n      quietly as she put down her extinguished lamp\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cVictor rests well: he smiled in his sleep; he has your smile, monsieur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      The said Victor was of course her own boy, born in the third year of our\r\n      marriage: his Christian name had been given him in honour of M.\r\n      Vandenhuten, who continued always our trusty and well-beloved friend.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances was then a good and dear wife to me, because I was to her a good,\r\n      just, and faithful husband. What she would have been had she married a\r\n      harsh, envious, careless man\u2014a profligate, a prodigal, a drunkard,\r\n      or a tyrant\u2014is another question, and one which I once propounded to\r\n      her. Her answer, given after some reflection, was\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI should have tried to endure the evil or cure it for awhile; and when I\r\n      found it intolerable and incurable, I should have left my torturer\r\n      suddenly and silently.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd if law or might had forced you back again?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWhat, to a drunkard, a profligate, a selfish spendthrift, an unjust\r\n      fool?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI would have gone back; again assured myself whether or not his vice and\r\n      my misery were capable of remedy; and if not, have left him again.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd if again forced to return, and compelled to abide?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, hastily. \u201cWhy do you ask me, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I would have an answer, because I saw a strange kind of spirit in her eye,\r\n      whose voice I determined to waken.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, if a wife\u2019s nature loathes that of the man she is wedded to,\r\n      marriage must be slavery. Against slavery all right thinkers revolt, and\r\n      though torture be the price of resistance, torture must be dared: though\r\n      the only road to freedom lie through the gates of death, those gates must\r\n      be passed; for freedom is indispensable. Then, monsieur, I would resist as\r\n      far as my strength permitted; when that strength failed I should be sure\r\n      of a refuge. Death would certainly screen me both from bad laws and their\r\n      consequences.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cVoluntary death, Frances?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur. I\u2019d have courage to live out every throe of anguish fate\r\n      assigned me, and principle to contend for justice and liberty to the\r\n      last.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI see you would have made no patient Grizzle. And now, supposing fate had\r\n      merely assigned you the lot of an old maid, what then? How would you have\r\n      liked celibacy?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cNot much, certainly. An old maid\u2019s life must doubtless be void and\r\n      vapid\u2014her heart strained and empty. Had I been an old maid I should have\r\n      spent existence in efforts to fill the void and ease the aching. I should\r\n      have probably failed, and died weary and disappointed, despised and of no\r\n      account, like other single women. But I\u2019m not an old maid,\u201d she added\r\n      quickly. \u201cI should have been, though, but for my master. I should never\r\n      have suited any man but Professor Crimsworth\u2014no other gentleman,\r\n      French, English, or Belgian, would have thought me amiable or handsome;\r\n      and I doubt whether I should have cared for the approbation of many\r\n      others, if I could have obtained it. Now, I have been Professor\r\n      Crimsworth\u2019s wife eight years, and what is he in my eyes? Is he\r\n      honourable, beloved \u2014\u2014?\u201d She stopped, her voice was cut off,\r\n      her eyes suddenly suffused. She and I were standing side by side; she\r\n      threw her arms round me, and strained me to her heart with passionate\r\n      earnestness: the energy of her whole being glowed in her dark and then\r\n      dilated eye, and crimsoned her animated cheek; her look and movement were\r\n      like inspiration; in one there was such a flash, in the other such a\r\n      power. Half an hour afterwards, when she had become calm, I asked where\r\n      all that wild vigour was gone which had transformed her ere-while and made\r\n      her glance so thrilling and ardent\u2014her action so rapid and strong.\r\n      She looked down, smiling softly and passively:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI cannot tell where it is gone, monsieur,\u201d said she, \u201cbut I know that,\r\n      whenever it is wanted, it will come back again.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      Behold us now at the close of the ten years, and we have realized an\r\n      independency. The rapidity with which we attained this end had its origin\r\n      in three reasons:\u2014 Firstly, we worked so hard for it; secondly, we\r\n      had no incumbrances to delay success; thirdly, as soon as we had capital\r\n      to invest, two well-skilled counsellors, one in Belgium, one in England,\r\n      viz. Vandenhuten and Hunsden, gave us each a word of advice as to the sort\r\n      of investment to be chosen. The suggestion made was judicious; and, being\r\n      promptly acted on, the result proved gainful\u2014I need not say how\r\n      gainful; I communicated details to Messrs. Vandenhuten and Hunsden; nobody\r\n      else can be interested in hearing them.\r\n    \n\r\n      Accounts being wound up, and our professional connection disposed of, we\r\n      both agreed that, as mammon was not our master, nor his service that in\r\n      which we desired to spend our lives; as our desires were temperate, and\r\n      our habits unostentatious, we had now abundance to live on\u2014abundance\r\n      to leave our boy; and should besides always have a balance on hand, which,\r\n      properly managed by right sympathy and unselfish activity, might help\r\n      philanthropy in her enterprises, and put solace into the hand of charity.\r\n    \n\r\n      To England we now resolved to take wing; we arrived there safely; Frances\r\n      realized the dream of her lifetime. We spent a whole summer and autumn in\r\n      travelling from end to end of the British islands, and afterwards passed a\r\n      winter in London. Then we thought it high time to fix our residence. My\r\n      heart yearned towards my native county of \u2014\u2014shire; and it is\r\n      in \u2014\u2014shire I now live; it is in the library of my own home I\r\n      am now writing. That home lies amid a sequestered and rather hilly region,\r\n      thirty miles removed from X\u2014\u2014; a region whose verdure the\r\n      smoke of mills has not yet sullied, whose waters still run pure, whose\r\n      swells of moorland preserve in some ferny glens that lie between them the\r\n      very primal wildness of nature, her moss, her bracken, her blue-bells, her\r\n      scents of reed and heather, her free and fresh breezes. My house is a\r\n      picturesque and not too spacious dwelling, with low and long windows, a\r\n      trellised and leaf-veiled porch over the front door, just now, on this\r\n      summer evening, looking like an arch of roses and ivy. The garden is\r\n      chiefly laid out in lawn, formed of the sod of the hills, with herbage\r\n      short and soft as moss, full of its own peculiar flowers, tiny and\r\n      starlike, imbedded in the minute embroidery of their fine foliage. At the\r\n      bottom of the sloping garden there is a wicket, which opens upon a lane as\r\n      green as the lawn, very long, shady, and little frequented; on the turf of\r\n      this lane generally appear the first daisies of spring\u2014whence its\r\n      name\u2014Daisy Lane; serving also as a distinction to the house.\r\n    \n\r\n      It terminates (the lane I mean) in a valley full of wood; which\r\n      wood\u2014chiefly oak and beech\u2014spreads shadowy about the vicinage of a very\r\n      old mansion, one of the Elizabethan structures, much larger, as well as\r\n      more antique than Daisy Lane, the property and residence of an individual\r\n      familiar both to me and to the reader. Yes, in Hunsden Wood\u2014for so\r\n      are those glades and that grey building, with many gables and more\r\n      chimneys, named\u2014abides Yorke Hunsden, still unmarried; never, I\r\n      suppose, having yet found his ideal, though I know at least a score of\r\n      young ladies within a circuit of forty miles, who would be willing to\r\n      assist him in the search.\r\n    \n\r\n      The estate fell to him by the death of his father, five years since; he\r\n      has given up trade, after having made by it sufficient to pay off some\r\n      incumbrances by which the family heritage was burdened. I say he abides\r\n      here, but I do not think he is resident above five months out of the\r\n      twelve; he wanders from land to land, and spends some part of each winter\r\n      in town: he frequently brings visitors with him when he comes to \u2014\u2014shire,\r\n      and these visitors are often foreigners; sometimes he has a German\r\n      metaphysician, sometimes a French savant; he had once a dissatisfied and\r\n      savage-looking Italian, who neither sang nor played, and of whom Frances\r\n      affirmed that he had \u201ctout l\u2019air d\u2019un conspirateur.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      What English guests Hunsden invites, are all either men of Birmingham or\r\n      Manchester\u2014hard men, seemingly knit up in one thought, whose talk is\r\n      of free trade. The foreign visitors, too, are politicians; they take a\r\n      wider theme\u2014European progress\u2014the spread of liberal sentiments\r\n      over the Continent; on their mental tablets, the names of Russia, Austria,\r\n      and the Pope, are inscribed in red ink. I have heard some of them talk\r\n      vigorous sense\u2014yea, I have been present at polyglot discussions in\r\n      the old, oak-lined dining-room at Hunsden Wood, where a singular insight\r\n      was given of the sentiments entertained by resolute minds respecting old\r\n      northern despotisms, and old southern superstitions: also, I have heard\r\n      much twaddle, enounced chiefly in French and Deutsch, but let that pass.\r\n      Hunsden himself tolerated the drivelling theorists; with the practical men\r\n      he seemed leagued hand and heart.\r\n    \n\r\n      When Hunsden is staying alone at the Wood (which seldom happens) he\r\n      generally finds his way two or three times a week to Daisy Lane. He has a\r\n      philanthropic motive for coming to smoke his cigar in our porch on summer\r\n      evenings; he says he does it to kill the earwigs amongst the roses, with\r\n      which insects, but for his benevolent fumigations, he intimates we should\r\n      certainly be overrun. On wet days, too, we are almost sure to see him;\r\n      according to him, it gets on time to work me into lunacy by treading on my\r\n      mental corns, or to force from Mrs. Crimsworth revelations of the dragon\r\n      within her, by insulting the memory of Hofer and Tell.\r\n    \n\r\n      We also go frequently to Hunsden Wood, and both I and Frances relish a\r\n      visit there highly. If there are other guests, their characters are an\r\n      interesting study; their conversation is exciting and strange; the absence\r\n      of all local narrowness both in the host and his chosen society gives a\r\n      metropolitan, almost a cosmopolitan freedom and largeness to the talk.\r\n      Hunsden himself is a polite man in his own house: he has, when he chooses\r\n      to employ it, an inexhaustible power of entertaining guests; his very\r\n      mansion too is interesting, the rooms look storied, the passages\r\n      legendary, the low-ceiled chambers, with their long rows of diamond-paned\r\n      lattices, have an old-world, haunted air: in his travels he has collected\r\n      stores of articles of virtu, which are well and\r\n      tastefully disposed in his panelled or tapestried rooms: I have seen there\r\n      one or two pictures, and one or two pieces of statuary which many an\r\n      aristocratic connoisseur might have envied.\r\n    \n\r\n      When I and Frances have dined and spent an evening with Hunsden, he often\r\n      walks home with us. His wood is large, and some of the timber is old and\r\n      of huge growth. There are winding ways in it which, pursued through glade\r\n      and brake, make the walk back to Daisy Lane a somewhat long one. Many a\r\n      time, when we have had the benefit of a full moon, and when the night has\r\n      been mild and balmy, when, moreover, a certain nightingale has been\r\n      singing, and a certain stream, hid in alders, has lent the song a soft\r\n      accompaniment, the remote church-bell of the one hamlet in a district of\r\n      ten miles, has tolled midnight ere the lord of the wood left us at our\r\n      porch. Free-flowing was his talk at such hours, and far more quiet and\r\n      gentle than in the day-time and before numbers. He would then forget\r\n      politics and discussion, and would dwell on the past times of his house,\r\n      on his family history, on himself and his own feelings\u2014subjects each\r\n      and all invested with a peculiar zest, for they were each and all unique.\r\n      One glorious night in June, after I had been taunting him about his ideal\r\n      bride and asking him when she would come and graft her foreign beauty on\r\n      the old Hunsden oak, he answered suddenly\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cYou call her ideal; but see, here is her shadow; and there cannot be a\r\n      shadow without a substance.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He had led us from the depth of the \u201cwinding way\u201d into a glade from whence\r\n      the beeches withdrew, leaving it open to the sky; an unclouded moon poured\r\n      her light into this glade, and Hunsden held out under her beam an ivory\r\n      miniature.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances, with eagerness, examined it first; then she gave it to me\u2014still,\r\n      however, pushing her little face close to mine, and seeking in my eyes\r\n      what I thought of the portrait. I thought it represented a very handsome\r\n      and very individual-looking female face, with, as he had once said,\r\n      \u201cstraight and harmonious features.\u201d It was dark; the hair, raven-black,\r\n      swept not only from the brow, but from the temples\u2014seemed thrust\r\n      away carelessly, as if such beauty dispensed with, nay, despised\r\n      arrangement. The Italian eye looked straight into you, and an independent,\r\n      determined eye it was; the mouth was as firm as fine; the chin ditto. On\r\n      the back of the miniature was gilded \u201cLucia.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cThat is a real head,\u201d was my conclusion.\r\n    \n\r\n      Hunsden smiled.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied. \u201cAll was real in Lucia.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cAnd she was somebody you would have liked to marry\u2014but could not?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI should certainly have liked to marry her, and that I have not\r\n      done so is a proof that I could not.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He repossessed himself of the miniature, now again in Frances\u2019 hand, and\r\n      put it away.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d he asked of my wife, as he buttoned\r\n      his coat over it.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cI am sure Lucia once wore chains and broke them,\u201d was the strange answer.\r\n      \u201cI do not mean matrimonial chains,\u201d she added, correcting herself, as if\r\n      she feared mis-interpretation, \u201cbut social chains of some sort. The face\r\n      is that of one who has made an effort, and a successful and triumphant\r\n      effort, to wrest some vigorous and valued faculty from insupportable\r\n      constraint; and when Lucia\u2019s faculty got free, I am certain it spread wide\r\n      pinions and carried her higher than\u2014\u201d she hesitated.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThan what?\u201d demanded Hunsden.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cThan \u2018les convenances\u2019 permitted you to follow.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI think you grow spiteful\u2014impertinent.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cLucia has trodden the stage,\u201d continued Frances. \u201cYou never seriously\r\n      thought of marrying her; you admired her originality, her fearlessness,\r\n      her energy of body and mind; you delighted in her talent, whatever that\r\n      was, whether song, dance, or dramatic representation; you worshipped her\r\n      beauty, which was of the sort after your own heart: but I am sure she\r\n      filled a sphere from whence you would never have thought of taking a\r\n      wife.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cIngenious,\u201d remarked Hunsden; \u201cwhether true or not is another question.\r\n      Meantime, don\u2019t you feel your little lamp of a spirit wax very pale,\r\n      beside such a girandole as Lucia\u2019s?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cCandid, at least; and the Professor will soon be dissatisfied with the\r\n      dim light you give?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWill you, monsieur?\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cMy sight was always too weak to endure a blaze, Frances,\u201d and we had now\r\n      reached the wicket.\r\n    \n\r\n      I said, a few pages back, that this is a sweet summer evening; it is\u2014there\r\n      has been a series of lovely days, and this is the loveliest; the hay is\r\n      just carried from my fields, its perfume still lingers in the air. Frances\r\n      proposed to me, an hour or two since, to take tea out on the lawn; I see\r\n      the round table, loaded with china, placed under a certain beech; Hunsden\r\n      is expected\u2014nay, I hear he is come\u2014there is his voice, laying\r\n      down the law on some point with authority; that of Frances replies; she\r\n      opposes him of course. They are disputing about Victor, of whom Hunsden\r\n      affirms that his mother is making a milksop. Mrs. Crimsworth retaliates:\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cBetter a thousand times he should be a milksop than what he, Hunsden,\r\n      calls \u2018a fine lad;\u2019 and moreover she says that if Hunsden were to become a\r\n      fixture in the neighbourhood, and were not a mere comet, coming and going,\r\n      no one knows how, when, where, or why, she should be quite uneasy till she\r\n      had got Victor away to a school at least a hundred miles off; for that\r\n      with his mutinous maxims and unpractical dogmas, he would ruin a score of\r\n      children.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I have a word to say of Victor ere I shut this manuscript in my desk\u2014but\r\n      it must be a brief one, for I hear the tinkle of silver on porcelain.\r\n    \n\r\n      Victor is as little of a pretty child as I am of a handsome man, or his\r\n      mother of a fine woman; he is pale and spare, with large eyes, as dark as\r\n      those of Frances, and as deeply set as mine. His shape is symmetrical\r\n      enough, but slight; his health is good. I never saw a child smile less\r\n      than he does, nor one who knits such a formidable brow when sitting over a\r\n      book that interests him, or while listening to tales of adventure, peril,\r\n      or wonder, narrated by his mother, Hunsden, or myself. But though still,\r\n      he is not unhappy\u2014though serious, not morose; he has a\r\n      susceptibility to pleasurable sensations almost too keen, for it amounts\r\n      to enthusiasm. He learned to read in the old-fashioned way out of a\r\n      spelling-book at his mother\u2019s knee, and as he got on without driving by\r\n      that method, she thought it unnecessary to buy him ivory letters, or to\r\n      try any of the other inducements to learning now deemed indispensable.\r\n      When he could read, he became a glutton of books, and is so still. His\r\n      toys have been few, and he has never wanted more. For those he possesses,\r\n      he seems to have contracted a partiality amounting to affection; this\r\n      feeling, directed towards one or two living animals of the house,\r\n      strengthens almost to a passion.\r\n    \n\r\n      Mr. Hunsden gave him a mastiff cub, which he called Yorke, after the\r\n      donor; it grew to a superb dog, whose fierceness, however, was much\r\n      modified by the companionship and caresses of its young master. He would\r\n      go nowhere, do nothing without Yorke; Yorke lay at his feet while he\r\n      learned his lessons, played with him in the garden, walked with him in the\r\n      lane and wood, sat near his chair at meals, was fed always by his own\r\n      hand, was the first thing he sought in the morning, the last he left at\r\n      night. Yorke accompanied Mr. Hunsden one day to X\u2014\u2014, and was\r\n      bitten in the street by a dog in a rabid state. As soon as Hunsden had\r\n      brought him home, and had informed me of the circumstance, I went into the\r\n      yard and shot him where he lay licking his wound: he was dead in an\r\n      instant; he had not seen me level the gun; I stood behind him. I had\r\n      scarcely been ten minutes in the house, when my ear was struck with sounds\r\n      of anguish: I repaired to the yard once more, for they proceeded thence.\r\n      Victor was kneeling beside his dead mastiff, bent over it, embracing its\r\n      bull-like neck, and lost in a passion of the wildest woe: he saw me.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cOh, papa, I\u2019ll never forgive you! I\u2019ll never forgive you!\u201d was his\r\n      exclamation. \u201cYou shot Yorke\u2014I saw it from the window. I never\r\n      believed you could be so cruel\u2014I can love you no more!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      I had much ado to explain to him, with a steady voice, the stern necessity\r\n      of the deed; he still, with that inconsolable and bitter accent which I\r\n      cannot render, but which pierced my heart, repeated\u2014\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cHe might have been cured\u2014you should have tried\u2014you should\r\n      have burnt the wound with a hot iron, or covered it with caustic. You gave\r\n      no time; and now it is too late\u2014he is dead!\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      He sank fairly down on the senseless carcase; I waited patiently a long\r\n      while, till his grief had somewhat exhausted him; and then I lifted him in\r\n      my arms and carried him to his mother, sure that she would comfort him\r\n      best. She had witnessed the whole scene from a window; she would not come\r\n      out for fear of increasing my difficulties by her emotion, but she was\r\n      ready now to receive him. She took him to her kind heart, and on to her\r\n      gentle lap; consoled him but with her lips, her eyes, her soft embrace,\r\n      for some time; and then, when his sobs diminished, told him that Yorke had\r\n      felt no pain in dying, and that if he had been left to expire naturally,\r\n      his end would have been most horrible; above all, she told him that I was\r\n      not cruel (for that idea seemed to give exquisite pain to poor Victor),\r\n      that it was my affection for Yorke and him which had made me act so, and\r\n      that I was now almost heart-broken to see him weep thus bitterly.\r\n    \n\r\n      Victor would have been no true son of his father, had these\r\n      considerations, these reasons, breathed in so low, so sweet a tone\u2014married\r\n      to caresses so benign, so tender\u2014to looks so inspired with pitying\r\n      sympathy\u2014produced no effect on him. They did produce an effect: he\r\n      grew calmer, rested his face on her shoulder, and lay still in her arms.\r\n      Looking up, shortly, he asked his mother to tell him over again what she\r\n      had said about Yorke having suffered no pain, and my not being cruel; the\r\n      balmy words being repeated, he again pillowed his cheek on her breast, and\r\n      was again tranquil.\r\n    \n\r\n      Some hours after, he came to me in my library, asked if I forgave him, and\r\n      desired to be reconciled. I drew the lad to my side, and there I kept him\r\n      a good while, and had much talk with him, in the course of which he\r\n      disclosed many points of feeling and thought I approved of in my son. I\r\n      found, it is true, few elements of the \u201cgood fellow\u201d or the \u201cfine fellow\u201d\r\n       in him; scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash over the wine\r\n      cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the\r\n      soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of compassion, affection,\r\n      fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of\r\n      wholesome principles\u2014reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if\r\n      not blighted, a fertile bearing. So I bestowed on his large forehead, and\r\n      on his cheek\u2014still pale with tears\u2014a proud and contented kiss,\r\n      and sent him away comforted. Yet I saw him the next day laid on the mound\r\n      under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered with his hands; he was\r\n      melancholy for some weeks, and more than a year elapsed before he would\r\n      listen to any proposal of having another dog.\r\n    \n\r\n      Victor learns fast. He must soon go to Eton, where, I suspect, his first\r\n      year or two will be utter wretchedness: to leave me, his mother, and his\r\n      home, will give his heart an agonized wrench; then, the fagging will not\r\n      suit him\u2014but emulation, thirst after knowledge, the glory of\r\n      success, will stir and reward him in time. Meantime, I feel in myself a\r\n      strong repugnance to fix the hour which will uproot my sole olive branch,\r\n      and transplant it far from me; and, when I speak to Frances on the\r\n      subject, I am heard with a kind of patient pain, as though I alluded to\r\n      some fearful operation, at which her nature shudders, but from which her\r\n      fortitude will not permit her to recoil. The step must, however, be taken,\r\n      and it shall be; for, though Frances will not make a milksop of\r\n      her son, she will accustom him to a style of treatment, a forbearance, a\r\n      congenial tenderness, he will meet with from none else. She sees, as I\r\n      also see, a something in Victor\u2019s temper\u2014a kind of electrical ardour and\r\n      power\u2014which emits, now and then, ominous sparks; Hunsden calls it his\r\n      spirit, and says it should not be curbed. I call it the leaven of the\r\n      offending Adam, and consider that it should be, if not whipped\r\n      out of him, at least soundly disciplined; and that he will be cheap of any\r\n      amount of either bodily or mental suffering which will ground him\r\n      radically in the art of self-control. Frances gives this\r\n      something in her son\u2019s marked character\r\n      no name; but when it appears in the grinding of his teeth, in the\r\n      glittering of his eye, in the fierce revolt of feeling against\r\n      disappointment, mischance, sudden sorrow, or supposed injustice, she folds\r\n      him to her breast, or takes him to walk with her alone in the wood; then\r\n      she reasons with him like any philosopher, and to reason Victor is ever\r\n      accessible; then she looks at him with eyes of love, and by love Victor\r\n      can be infallibly subjugated; but will reason or love be the weapons with\r\n      which in future the world will meet his violence? Oh, no! for that flash\r\n      in his black eye\u2014for that cloud on his bony brow\u2014for that\r\n      compression of his statuesque lips, the lad will some day get blows\r\n      instead of blandishments\u2014kicks instead of kisses; then for the fit\r\n      of mute fury which will sicken his body and madden his soul; then for the\r\n      ordeal of merited and salutary suffering, out of which he will come (I\r\n      trust) a wiser and a better man.\r\n    \n\r\n      I see him now; he stands by Hunsden, who is seated on the lawn under the\r\n      beech; Hunsden\u2019s hand rests on the boy\u2019s collar, and he is instilling God\r\n      knows what principles into his ear. Victor looks well just now, for he\r\n      listens with a sort of smiling interest; he never looks so like his mother\r\n      as when he smiles\u2014pity the sunshine breaks out so rarely! Victor has\r\n      a preference for Hunsden, full as strong as I deem desirable, being\r\n      considerably more potent, decided, and indiscriminating, than any I ever\r\n      entertained for that personage myself. Frances, too, regards it with a\r\n      sort of unexpressed anxiety; while her son leans on Hunsden\u2019s knee, or\r\n      rests against his shoulder, she roves with restless movement round, like a\r\n      dove guarding its young from a hovering hawk; she says she wishes Hunsden\r\n      had children of his own, for then he would better know the danger of\r\n      inciting their pride and indulging their foibles.\r\n    \n\r\n      Frances approaches my library window; puts aside the honeysuckle which\r\n      half covers it, and tells me tea is ready; seeing that I continue busy she\r\n      enters the room, comes near me quietly, and puts her hand on my shoulder.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur est trop appliqu\u00e9.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI shall soon have done.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      She draws a chair near, and sits down to wait till I have finished; her\r\n      presence is as pleasant to my mind as the perfume of the fresh hay and\r\n      spicy flowers, as the glow of the westering sun, as the repose of the\r\n      midsummer eve are to my senses.\r\n    \n\r\n      But Hunsden comes; I hear his step, and there he is, bending through the\r\n      lattice, from which he has thrust away the woodbine with unsparing hand,\r\n      disturbing two bees and a butterfly.\r\n    \n\r\n      \u201cCrimsworth! I say, Crimsworth! take that pen out of his hand, mistress,\r\n      and make him lift up his head.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cWell, Hunsden? I hear you\u2014\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cI was at X\u2014\u2014 yesterday! your brother Ned is getting richer\r\n      than Croesus by railway speculations; they call him in the Piece Hall a\r\n      stag of ten; and I have heard from Brown. M. and Madame Vandenhuten and\r\n      Jean Baptiste talk of coming to see you next month. He mentions the Pelets\r\n      too; he says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world, but in\r\n      business they are doing \u2018on ne peut mieux,\u2019 which circumstance he\r\n      concludes will be a sufficient consolation to both for any little crosses\r\n      in the affections. Why don\u2019t you invite the Pelets to \u2014\u2014shire,\r\n      Crimsworth? I should so like to see your first flame, Zora\u00efde. Mistress,\r\n      don\u2019t be jealous, but he loved that lady to distraction; I know it for a\r\n      fact. Brown says she weighs twelve stones now; you see what you\u2019ve lost,\r\n      Mr. Professor. Now, Monsieur and Madame, if you don\u2019t come to tea, Victor\r\n      and I will begin without you.\u201d\r\n     \n\r\n      \u201cPapa, come!\u201d\r\n     \n"}
