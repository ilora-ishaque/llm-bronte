{"2": "\nCHAPTER I.\r\nBRETTON.\n\r\nMy godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of\r\nBretton. Her husband\u2019s family had been residents there for generations, and\r\nbore, indeed, the name of their birthplace\u2014Bretton of Bretton: whether by\r\ncoincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient\r\nimportance to leave his name to his neighbourhood, I know not.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I liked the\r\nvisit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The large peaceful rooms,\r\nthe well-arranged furniture, the clear wide windows, the balcony outside,\r\nlooking down on a fine antique street, where Sundays and holidays seemed always\r\nto abide\u2014so quiet was its atmosphere, so clean its pavement\u2014these things\r\npleased me well.\r\n\n\r\nOne child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of, and in a\r\nquiet way I was a good deal taken notice of by Mrs. Bretton, who had been left\r\na widow, with one son, before I knew her; her husband, a physician, having died\r\nwhile she was yet a young and handsome woman.\r\n\n\r\nShe was not young, as I remember her, but she was still handsome, tall,\r\nwell-made, and though dark for an Englishwoman, yet wearing always the\r\nclearness of health in her brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair of fine,\r\ncheerful black eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that she had not\r\nconferred her complexion on her son, whose eyes were blue\u2014though, even in\r\nboyhood, very piercing\u2014and the colour of his long hair such as friends did not\r\nventure to specify, except as the sun shone on it, when they called it golden.\r\nHe inherited the lines of his mother\u2019s features, however; also her good teeth,\r\nher stature (or the promise of her stature, for he was not yet full-grown),\r\nand, what was better, her health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and\r\nequality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.\r\n\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year \u2014\u2014 I was staying at Bretton; my godmother having come\r\nin person to claim me of the kinsfolk with whom was at that time fixed my\r\npermanent residence. I believe she then plainly saw events coming, whose very\r\nshadow I scarce guessed; yet of which the faint suspicion sufficed to impart\r\nunsettled sadness, and made me glad to change scene and society.\r\n\n\r\nTime always flowed smoothly for me at my godmother\u2019s side; not with tumultuous\r\nswiftness, but blandly, like the gliding of a full river through a plain. My\r\nvisits to her resembled the sojourn of Christian and Hopeful beside a certain\r\npleasant stream, with \u201cgreen trees on each bank, and meadows beautified with\r\nlilies all the year round.\u201d The charm of variety there was not, nor the\r\nexcitement of incident; but I liked peace so well, and sought stimulus so\r\nlittle, that when the latter came I almost felt it a disturbance, and wished\r\nrather it had still held aloof.\r\n\n\r\nOne day a letter was received of which the contents evidently caused Mrs.\r\nBretton surprise and some concern. I thought at first it was from home, and\r\ntrembled, expecting I know not what disastrous communication: to me, however,\r\nno reference was made, and the cloud seemed to pass.\r\n\n\r\nThe next day, on my return from a long walk, I found, as I entered my bedroom,\r\nan unexpected change. In addition to my own French bed in its shady recess,\r\nappeared in a corner a small crib, draped with white; and in addition to my\r\nmahogany chest of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood chest. I stood still, gazed,\r\nand considered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf what are these things the signs and tokens?\u201d I asked. The answer was\r\nobvious. \u201cA second guest is coming: Mrs. Bretton expects other visitors.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn descending to dinner, explanations ensued. A little girl, I was told, would\r\nshortly be my companion: the daughter of a friend and distant relation of the\r\nlate Dr. Bretton\u2019s. This little girl, it was added, had recently lost her\r\nmother; though, indeed, Mrs. Bretton ere long subjoined, the loss was not so\r\ngreat as might at first appear. Mrs. Home (Home it seems was the name) had been\r\na very pretty, but a giddy, careless woman, who had neglected her child, and\r\ndisappointed and disheartened her husband. So far from congenial had the union\r\nproved, that separation at last ensued\u2014separation by mutual consent, not after\r\nany legal process. Soon after this event, the lady having over-exerted herself\r\nat a ball, caught cold, took a fever, and died after a very brief illness. Her\r\nhusband, naturally a man of very sensitive feelings, and shocked inexpressibly\r\nby too sudden communication of the news, could hardly, it seems, now be\r\npersuaded but that some over-severity on his part\u2014some deficiency in patience\r\nand indulgence\u2014had contributed to hasten her end. He had brooded over this idea\r\ntill his spirits were seriously affected; the medical men insisted on\r\ntravelling being tried as a remedy, and meanwhile Mrs. Bretton had offered to\r\ntake charge of his little girl. \u201cAnd I hope,\u201d added my godmother in conclusion,\r\n\u201cthe child will not be like her mamma; as silly and frivolous a little flirt as\r\never sensible man was weak enough to marry. For,\u201d said she, \u201cMr. Home is\r\na sensible man in his way, though not very practical: he is fond of science,\r\nand lives half his life in a laboratory trying experiments\u2014a thing his\r\nbutterfly wife could neither comprehend nor endure; and indeed\u201d confessed my\r\ngodmother, \u201cI should not have liked it myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn answer to a question of mine, she further informed me that her late husband\r\nused to say, Mr. Home had derived this scientific turn from a maternal uncle, a\r\nFrench savant; for he came, it seems; of mixed French and Scottish origin, and\r\nhad connections now living in France, of whom more than one wrote de\r\nbefore his name, and called himself noble.\r\n\n\r\nThat same evening at nine o\u2019clock, a servant was despatched to meet the coach\r\nby which our little visitor was expected. Mrs. Bretton and I sat alone in the\r\ndrawing-room waiting her coming; John Graham Bretton being absent on a visit to\r\none of his schoolfellows who lived in the country. My godmother read the\r\nevening paper while she waited; I sewed. It was a wet night; the rain lashed\r\nthe panes, and the wind sounded angry and restless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor child!\u201d said Mrs. Bretton from time to time. \u201cWhat weather for her\r\njourney! I wish she were safe here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA little before ten the door-bell announced Warren\u2019s return. No sooner was the\r\ndoor opened than I ran down into the hall; there lay a trunk and some\r\nband-boxes, beside them stood a person like a nurse-girl, and at the foot of\r\nthe staircase was Warren with a shawled bundle in his arms.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that the child?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI would have opened the shawl, and tried to get a peep at the face, but it was\r\nhastily turned from me to Warren\u2019s shoulder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut me down, please,\u201d said a small voice when Warren opened the drawing-room\r\ndoor, \u201cand take off this shawl,\u201d continued the speaker, extracting with its\r\nminute hand the pin, and with a sort of fastidious haste doffing the clumsy\r\nwrapping. The creature which now appeared made a deft attempt to fold the\r\nshawl; but the drapery was much too heavy and large to be sustained or wielded\r\nby those hands and arms. \u201cGive it to Harriet, please,\u201d was then the direction,\r\n\u201cand she can put it away.\u201d This said, it turned and fixed its eyes on Mrs.\r\nBretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome here, little dear,\u201d said that lady. \u201cCome and let me see if you are cold\r\nand damp: come and let me warm you at the fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe child advanced promptly. Relieved of her wrapping, she appeared exceedingly\r\ntiny; but was a neat, completely-fashioned little figure, light, slight, and\r\nstraight. Seated on my godmother\u2019s ample lap, she looked a mere doll; her neck,\r\ndelicate as wax, her head of silky curls, increased, I thought, the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton talked in little fond phrases as she chafed the child\u2019s hands,\r\narms, and feet; first she was considered with a wistful gaze, but soon a smile\r\nanswered her. Mrs. Bretton was not generally a caressing woman: even with her\r\ndeeply-cherished son, her manner was rarely sentimental, often the reverse; but\r\nwhen the small stranger smiled at her, she kissed it, asking, \u201cWhat is my\r\nlittle one\u2019s name?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMissy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut besides Missy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly, papa calls her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill Polly be content to live with me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always; but till papa comes home. Papa is gone away.\u201d She shook her\r\nhead expressively.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe will return to Polly, or send for her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he, ma\u2019am? Do you know he will?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Harriet thinks not: at least not for a long while. He is ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer eyes filled. She drew her hand from Mrs. Bretton\u2019s and made a movement to\r\nleave her lap; it was at first resisted, but she said\u2014\u201cPlease, I wish to go: I\r\ncan sit on a stool.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe was allowed to slip down from the knee, and taking a footstool, she carried\r\nit to a corner where the shade was deep, and there seated herself. Mrs.\r\nBretton, though a commanding, and in grave matters even a peremptory woman, was\r\noften passive in trifles: she allowed the child her way. She said to me, \u201cTake\r\nno notice at present.\u201d But I did take notice: I watched Polly rest her small\r\nelbow on her small knee, her head on her hand; I observed her draw a square\r\ninch or two of pocket-handkerchief from the doll-pocket of her doll-skirt, and\r\nthen I heard her weep. Other children in grief or pain cry aloud, without shame\r\nor restraint; but this being wept: the tiniest occasional sniff testified to\r\nher emotion. Mrs. Bretton did not hear it: which was quite as well. Ere long, a\r\nvoice, issuing from the corner, demanded\u2014\u201cMay the bell be rung for Harriet!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rang; the nurse was summoned and came.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHarriet, I must be put to bed,\u201d said her little mistress. \u201cYou must ask where\r\nmy bed is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHarriet signified that she had already made that inquiry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAsk if you sleep with me, Harriet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Missy,\u201d said the nurse: \u201cyou are to share this young lady\u2019s room,\u201d\r\ndesignating me.\r\n\n\r\nMissy did not leave her seat, but I saw her eyes seek me. After some minutes\u2019\r\nsilent scrutiny, she emerged from her corner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish you, ma\u2019am, good night,\u201d said she to Mrs. Bretton; but she passed me\r\nmute.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Polly,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo need to say good-night, since we sleep in the same chamber,\u201d was the reply,\r\nwith which she vanished from the drawing-room. We heard Harriet propose to\r\ncarry her up-stairs. \u201cNo need,\u201d was again her answer\u2014\u201cno need, no need:\u201d and\r\nher small step toiled wearily up the staircase.\r\n\n\r\nOn going to bed an hour afterwards, I found her still wide awake. She had\r\narranged her pillows so as to support her little person in a sitting posture:\r\nher hands, placed one within the other, rested quietly on the sheet, with an\r\nold-fashioned calm most unchildlike. I abstained from speaking to her for some\r\ntime, but just before extinguishing the light, I recommended her to lie down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy and by,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will take cold, Missy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe took some tiny article of raiment from the chair at her crib side, and with\r\nit covered her shoulders. I suffered her to do as she pleased. Listening awhile\r\nin the darkness, I was aware that she still wept,\u2014wept under restraint, quietly\r\nand cautiously.\r\n\n\r\nOn awaking with daylight, a trickling of water caught my ear. Behold! there she\r\nwas risen and mounted on a stool near the washstand, with pains and difficulty\r\ninclining the ewer (which she could not lift) so as to pour its contents into\r\nthe basin. It was curious to watch her as she washed and dressed, so small,\r\nbusy, and noiseless. Evidently she was little accustomed to perform her own\r\ntoilet; and the buttons, strings, hooks and eyes, offered difficulties which\r\nshe encountered with a perseverance good to witness. She folded her\r\nnight-dress, she smoothed the drapery of her couch quite neatly; withdrawing\r\ninto a corner, where the sweep of the white curtain concealed her, she became\r\nstill. I half rose, and advanced my head to see how she was occupied. On her\r\nknees, with her forehead bent on her hands, I perceived that she was praying.\r\n\n\r\nHer nurse tapped at the door. She started up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am dressed, Harriet,\u201d said she; \u201cI have dressed myself, but I do not feel\r\nneat. Make me neat!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you dress yourself, Missy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush! speak low, Harriet, for fear of waking the girl\u201d (meaning me, who\r\nnow lay with my eyes shut). \u201cI dressed myself to learn, against the time you\r\nleave me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are cross, I have many a time wanted you to go, but not now. Tie my\r\nsash straight; make my hair smooth, please.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour sash is straight enough. What a particular little body you are!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt must be tied again. Please to tie it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, then. When I am gone you must get that young lady to dress you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn no account.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? She is a very nice young lady. I hope you mean to behave prettily to her,\r\nMissy, and not show your airs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe shall dress me on no account.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComical little thing!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not passing the comb straight through my hair, Harriet; the line will\r\nbe crooked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, you are ill to please. Does that suit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty well. Where should I go now that I am dressed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will take you into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey proceeded to the door. She stopped.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! Harriet, I wish this was papa\u2019s house! I don\u2019t know these people.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe a good child, Missy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am good, but I ache here;\u201d putting her hand to her heart, and moaning while\r\nshe reiterated, \u201cPapa! papa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI roused myself and started up, to check this scene while it was yet within\r\nbounds.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay good-morning to the young lady,\u201d dictated Harriet. She said,\r\n\u201cGood-morning,\u201d and then followed her nurse from the room. Harriet temporarily\r\nleft that same day, to go to her own friends, who lived in the neighbourhood.\r\n\n\r\nOn descending, I found Paulina (the child called herself Polly, but her full\r\nname was Paulina Mary) seated at the breakfast-table, by Mrs. Bretton\u2019s side; a\r\nmug of milk stood before her, a morsel of bread filled her hand, which lay\r\npassive on the table-cloth: she was not eating.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow we shall conciliate this little creature,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton to me, \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t know: she tastes nothing, and by her looks, she has not slept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI expressed my confidence in the effects of time and kindness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf she were to take a fancy to anybody in the house, she would soon settle;\r\nbut not till then,\u201d replied Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n"}
{"3": "\nCHAPTER II.\r\nPAULINA.\n\r\nSome days elapsed, and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy\r\nto anybody in the house. She was not exactly naughty or wilful: she was far\r\nfrom disobedient; but an object less conducive to comfort\u2014to tranquillity\r\neven\u2014than she presented, it was scarcely possible to have before one\u2019s eyes.\r\nShe moped: no grown person could have performed that uncheering business\r\nbetter; no furrowed face of adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe\u2019s\r\nantipodes, ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her\r\ninfant visage. She seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead\r\nguiltless of that curse, an overheated and discursive imagination; but\r\nwhenever, opening a room-door, I found her seated in a corner alone, her head\r\nin her pigmy hand, that room seemed to me not inhabited, but haunted.\r\n\n\r\nAnd again, when of moonlight nights, on waking, I beheld her figure, white and\r\nconspicuous in its night-dress, kneeling upright in bed, and praying like some\r\nCatholic or Methodist enthusiast\u2014some precocious fanatic or untimely saint\u2014I\r\nscarcely know what thoughts I had; but they ran risk of being hardly more\r\nrational and healthy than that child\u2019s mind must have been.\r\n\n\r\nI seldom caught a word of her prayers, for they were whispered low: sometimes,\r\nindeed, they were not whispered at all, but put up unuttered; such rare\r\nsentences as reached my ear still bore the burden, \u201cPapa; my dear papa!\u201d This,\r\nI perceived, was a one-idea\u2019d nature; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have\r\never thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed.\r\n\n\r\nWhat might have been the end of this fretting, had it continued unchecked, can\r\nonly be conjectured: it received, however, a sudden turn.\r\n\n\r\nOne afternoon, Mrs. Bretton, coaxing her from her usual station in a corner,\r\nhad lifted her into the window-seat, and, by way of occupying her attention,\r\ntold her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the\r\nstreet in a given time. She had sat listlessly, hardly looking, and not\r\ncounting, when\u2014my eye being fixed on hers\u2014I witnessed in its iris and pupil a\r\nstartling transfiguration. These sudden, dangerous natures\u2014sensitive as\r\nthey are called\u2014offer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler\r\ntemperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries. The fixed\r\nand heavy gaze swum, trembled, then glittered in fire; the small, overcast brow\r\ncleared; the trivial and dejected features lit up; the sad countenance\r\nvanished, and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness, an intense expectancy.\r\n\u201cIt is!\u201d were her words.\r\n\n\r\nLike a bird or a shaft, or any other swift thing, she was gone from the room.\r\nHow she got the house-door open I cannot tell; probably it might be ajar;\r\nperhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest, which would be impetuous\r\nenough. I\u2014watching calmly from the window\u2014saw her, in her black frock and tiny\r\nbraided apron (to pinafores she had an antipathy), dart half the length of the\r\nstreet; and, as I was on the point of turning, and quietly announcing to Mrs.\r\nBretton that the child was run out mad, and ought instantly to be pursued, I\r\nsaw her caught up, and rapt at once from my cool observation, and from the\r\nwondering stare of the passengers. A gentleman had done this good turn, and\r\nnow, covering her with his cloak, advanced to restore her to the house whence\r\nhe had seen her issue.\r\n\n\r\nI concluded he would leave her in a servant\u2019s charge and withdraw; but he\r\nentered: having tarried a little while below, he came up-stairs.\r\n\n\r\nHis reception immediately explained that he was known to Mrs. Bretton. She\r\nrecognised him; she greeted him, and yet she was fluttered, surprised, taken\r\nunawares. Her look and manner were even expostulatory; and in reply to these,\r\nrather than her words, he said,\u2014\u201cI could not help it, madam: I found it\r\nimpossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she\r\nsettled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will unsettle her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope not. And how is papa\u2019s little Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis question he addressed to Paulina, as he sat down and placed her gently on\r\nthe ground before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is Polly\u2019s papa?\u201d was the reply, as she leaned on his knee, and gazed up\r\ninto his face.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not a noisy, not a wordy scene: for that I was thankful; but it was a\r\nscene of feeling too brimful, and which, because the cup did not foam up high\r\nor furiously overflow, only oppressed one the more. On all occasions of\r\nvehement, unrestrained expansion, a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the\r\nweary spectator\u2019s relief; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of\r\nsensibility which bends of its own will, a giant slave under the sway of good\r\nsense.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home was a stern-featured\u2014perhaps I should rather say, a hard-featured man:\r\nhis forehead was knotty, and his cheekbones were marked and prominent. The\r\ncharacter of his face was quite Scotch; but there was feeling in his eye, and\r\nemotion in his now agitated countenance. His northern accent in speaking\r\nharmonised with his physiognomy. He was at once proud-looking and\r\nhomely-looking. He laid his hand on the child\u2019s uplifted head. She said\u2014\u201cKiss\r\nPolly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe kissed her. I wished she would utter some hysterical cry, so that I might\r\nget relief and be at ease. She made wonderfully little noise: she seemed to\r\nhave got what she wanted\u2014all she wanted, and to be in a trance of\r\ncontent. Neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire, and\r\nyet she was of his strain: her mind had been filled from his, as the cup from\r\nthe flagon.\r\n\n\r\nIndisputably, Mr. Home owned manly self-control, however he might secretly feel\r\non some matters. \u201cPolly,\u201d he said, looking down on his little girl, \u201cgo into\r\nthe hall; you will see papa\u2019s great-coat lying on a chair; put your hand into\r\nthe pockets, you will find a pocket-handkerchief there; bring it to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe obeyed; went and returned deftly and nimbly. He was talking to Mrs. Bretton\r\nwhen she came back, and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand. It was a\r\npicture, in its way, to see her, with her tiny stature, and trim, neat shape,\r\nstanding at his knee. Seeing that he continued to talk, apparently unconscious\r\nof her return, she took his hand, opened the unresisting fingers, insinuated\r\ninto them the handkerchief, and closed them upon it one by one. He still seemed\r\nnot to see or to feel her; but by-and-by, he lifted her to his knee; she\r\nnestled against him, and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an\r\nhour following, I suppose both were satisfied.\r\n\n\r\nDuring tea, the minute thing\u2019s movements and behaviour gave, as usual, full\r\noccupation to the eye. First she directed Warren, as he placed the chairs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut papa\u2019s chair here, and mine near it, between papa and Mrs. Bretton:\r\nI must hand his tea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe took her own seat, and beckoned with her hand to her father.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe near me, as if we were at home, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd again, as she intercepted his cup in passing, and would stir the sugar, and\r\nput in the cream herself, \u201cI always did it for you at home; papa: nobody could\r\ndo it as well, not even your own self.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the meal she continued her attentions: rather absurd they were. The\r\nsugar-tongs were too wide for one of her hands, and she had to use both in\r\nwielding them; the weight of the silver cream-ewer, the bread-and-butter\r\nplates, the very cup and saucer, tasked her insufficient strength and\r\ndexterity; but she would lift this, hand that, and luckily contrived through it\r\nall to break nothing. Candidly speaking, I thought her a little busy-body; but\r\nher father, blind like other parents, seemed perfectly content to let her wait\r\non him, and even wonderfully soothed by her offices.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is my comfort!\u201d he could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton. That lady had\r\nher own \u201ccomfort\u201d and nonpareil on a much larger scale, and, for the moment,\r\nabsent; so she sympathised with his foible.\r\n\n\r\nThis second \u201ccomfort\u201d came on the stage in the course of the evening. I knew\r\nthis day had been fixed for his return, and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had\r\nbeen expecting him through all its hours. We were seated round the fire, after\r\ntea, when Graham joined our circle: I should rather say, broke it up\u2014for, of\r\ncourse, his arrival made a bustle; and then, as Mr. Graham was fasting, there\r\nwas refreshment to be provided. He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance; of the\r\nlittle girl he took no notice for a time.\r\n\n\r\nHis meal over, and numerous questions from his mother answered, he turned from\r\nthe table to the hearth. Opposite where he had placed himself was seated Mr.\r\nHome, and at his elbow, the child. When I say child I use an\r\ninappropriate and undescriptive term\u2014a term suggesting any picture rather than\r\nthat of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette, that\r\nmight just have fitted a good-sized doll\u2014perched now on a high chair beside a\r\nstand, whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood, and holding in her\r\nhands a shred of a handkerchief, which she was professing to hem, and at which\r\nshe bored perseveringly with a needle, that in her fingers seemed almost a\r\nskewer, pricking herself ever and anon, marking the cambric with a track of\r\nminute red dots; occasionally starting when the perverse weapon\u2014swerving from\r\nher control\u2014inflicted a deeper stab than usual; but still silent, diligent,\r\nabsorbed, womanly.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was at that time a handsome, faithless-looking youth of sixteen. I say\r\nfaithless-looking, not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition,\r\nbut because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair, Celtic (not\r\nSaxon) character of his good looks; his waved light auburn hair, his supple\r\nsymmetry, his smile frequent, and destitute neither of fascination nor of\r\nsubtlety (in no bad sense). A spoiled, whimsical boy he was in those days.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d he said, after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for\r\nsome time, and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room relieved\r\nhim from the half-laughing bashfulness, which was all he knew of\r\ntimidity\u2014-\u201cMother, I see a young lady in the present society to whom I have not\r\nbeen introduced.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Home\u2019s little girl, I suppose you mean,\u201d said his mother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied her son, \u201cI consider your expression of the least\r\nceremonious: Miss Home I should certainly have said, in venturing to\r\nspeak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Graham, I will not have that child teased. Don\u2019t flatter yourself that I\r\nshall suffer you to make her your butt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Home,\u201d pursued Graham, undeterred by his mother\u2019s remonstrance, \u201cmight I\r\nhave the honour to introduce myself, since no one else seems willing to render\r\nyou and me that service? Your slave, John Graham Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked at him; he rose and bowed quite gravely. She deliberately put down\r\nthimble, scissors, work; descended with precaution from her perch, and\r\ncurtsying with unspeakable seriousness, said, \u201cHow do you do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have the honour to be in fair health, only in some measure fatigued with a\r\nhurried journey. I hope, ma\u2019am, I see you well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTor-rer-ably well,\u201d was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now\r\nessayed to regain her former elevation, but finding this could not be done\r\nwithout some climbing and straining\u2014a sacrifice of decorum not to be thought\r\nof\u2014and being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young\r\ngentleman, she relinquished the high chair for a low stool: towards that low\r\nstool Graham drew in his chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hope, ma\u2019am, the present residence, my mother\u2019s house, appears to you a\r\nconvenient place of abode?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot par-tic-er-er-ly; I want to go home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA natural and laudable desire, ma\u2019am; but one which, notwithstanding, I shall\r\ndo my best to oppose. I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that\r\nprecious commodity called amusement, which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail\r\nto yield me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall have to go with papa soon: I shall not stay long at your mother\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes; you will stay with me, I am sure. I have a pony on which you shall\r\nride, and no end of books with pictures to show you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to live here now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am. Does that please you? Do you like me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think you queer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy face, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour face and all about you: You have long red hair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAuburn hair, if you please: mamma calls it auburn, or golden, and so do all\r\nher friends. But even with my \u2018long red hair\u2019\u201d (and he waved his mane with a\r\nsort of triumph\u2014tawny he himself well knew that it was, and he was proud of the\r\nleonine hue), \u201cI cannot possibly be queerer than is your ladyship.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou call me queer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cI think I shall go to bed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since; but you\r\nprobably sat up in the expectation of seeing me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society. You knew I was\r\ncoming home, and would wait to have a look at me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI sat up for papa, and not for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Miss Home. I am going to be a favourite: preferred before papa\r\nsoon, I daresay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night; she seemed hesitating whether\r\nGraham\u2019s deserts entitled him to the same attention, when he caught her up with\r\none hand, and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head. She saw\r\nherself thus lifted up on high, in the glass over the fireplace. The\r\nsuddenness, the freedom, the disrespect of the action were too much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor shame, Mr. Graham!\u201d was her indignant cry, \u201cput me down!\u201d\u2014and when again\r\non her feet, \u201cI wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in\r\nthat way, lifting you with my hand\u201c (raising that mighty member) \u201cas Warren\r\nlifts the little cat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo saying, she departed.\r\n\n"}
{"4": "\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE PLAYMATES.\n\r\nMr. Home stayed two days. During his visit he could not be prevailed on to go\r\nout: he sat all day long by the fireside, sometimes silent, sometimes receiving\r\nand answering Mrs. Bretton\u2019s chat, which was just of the proper sort for a man\r\nin his morbid mood\u2014not over-sympathetic, yet not too uncongenial, sensible; and\r\neven with a touch of the motherly\u2014she was sufficiently his senior to be\r\npermitted this touch.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Paulina, the child was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful. Her\r\nfather frequently lifted her to his knee; she would sit there till she felt or\r\nfancied he grew restless; then it was\u2014\u201cPapa, put me down; I shall tire you with\r\nmy weight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the mighty burden slid to the rug, and establishing itself on carpet or\r\nstool just at \u201cpapa\u2019s\u201c feet, the white work-box and the scarlet-speckled\r\nhandkerchief came into play. This handkerchief, it seems, was intended as a\r\nkeepsake for \u201cpapa,\u201d and must be finished before his departure; consequently\r\nthe demand on the sempstress\u2019s industry (she accomplished about a score of\r\nstitches in half-an-hour) was stringent.\r\n\n\r\nThe evening, by restoring Graham to the maternal roof (his days were passed at\r\nschool), brought us an accession of animation\u2014a quality not diminished by the\r\nnature of the scenes pretty sure to be enacted between him and Miss Paulina.\r\n\n\r\nA distant and haughty demeanour had been the result of the indignity put upon\r\nher the first evening of his arrival: her usual answer, when he addressed her,\r\nwas\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t attend to you; I have other things to think about.\u201d Being implored\r\nto state what things:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBusiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham would endeavour to seduce her attention by opening his desk and\r\ndisplaying its multifarious contents: seals, bright sticks of wax, pen-knives,\r\nwith a miscellany of engravings\u2014some of them gaily coloured\u2014which he had\r\namassed from time to time. Nor was this powerful temptation wholly unavailing:\r\nher eyes, furtively raised from her work, cast many a peep towards the\r\nwriting-table, rich in scattered pictures. An etching of a child playing with a\r\nBlenheim spaniel happened to flutter to the floor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty little dog!\u201d said she, delighted.\r\n\n\r\nGraham prudently took no notice. Ere long, stealing from her corner, she\r\napproached to examine the treasure more closely. The dog\u2019s great eyes and long\r\nears, and the child\u2019s hat and feathers, were irresistible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNice picture!\u201d was her favourable criticism.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014you may have it,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nShe seemed to hesitate. The wish to possess was strong, but to accept would be\r\na compromise of dignity. No. She put it down and turned away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have it, then, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather not, thank you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell you what I will do with the picture if you refuse it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe half turned to listen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCut it into strips for lighting the taper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I shall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham waxed inexorable on hearing the pleading tone; he took the scissors from\r\nhis mother\u2019s work-basket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere goes!\u201d said he, making a menacing flourish. \u201cRight through Fido\u2019s head,\r\nand splitting little Harry\u2019s nose.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen come to me. Come quickly, or it is done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe hesitated, lingered, but complied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, will you have it?\u201d he asked, as she stood before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I shall want payment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA kiss.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive the picture first into my hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPolly, as she said this, looked rather faithless in her turn. Graham gave it.\r\nShe absconded a debtor, darted to her father, and took refuge on his knee.\r\nGraham rose in mimic wrath and followed. She buried her face in Mr. Home\u2019s\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa\u2014papa\u2014send him away!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll not be sent away,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nWith face still averted, she held out her hand to keep him off.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, I shall kiss the hand,\u201d said he; but that moment it became a miniature\r\nfist, and dealt him payment in a small coin that was not kisses.\r\n\n\r\nGraham\u2014not failing in his way to be as wily as his little playmate\u2014retreated\r\napparently quite discomfited; he flung himself on a sofa, and resting his head\r\nagainst the cushion, lay like one in pain. Polly, finding him silent, presently\r\npeeped at him. His eyes and face were covered with his hands. She turned on her\r\nfather\u2019s knee, and gazed at her foe anxiously and long. Graham groaned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, what is the matter?\u201d she whispered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had better ask him, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d (groan second.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe makes a noise as if he were,\u201d said Mr. Home.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d suggested Graham, feebly, \u201cI think you had better send for the\r\ndoctor. Oh my eye!\u201d (renewed silence, broken only by sighs from Graham.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to become blind\u2014\u2014?\u201d suggested this last.\r\n\n\r\nHis chastiser could not bear the suggestion. She was beside him directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me see your eye: I did not mean to touch it, only your mouth; and I did\r\nnot think I hit so very hard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSilence answered her. Her features worked,\u2014\u201cI am sorry; I am sorry!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen succeeded emotion, faltering; weeping.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave done trying that child, Graham,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is all nonsense, my pet,\u201d cried Mr. Home.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Graham once more snatched her aloft, and she again punished him; and while\r\nshe pulled his lion\u2019s locks, termed him\u2014\u201cThe naughtiest, rudest, worst,\r\nuntruest person that ever was.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn the morning of Mr. Home\u2019s departure, he and his daughter had some\r\nconversation in a window-recess by themselves; I heard part of it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t I pack my box and go with you, papa?\u201d she whispered earnestly.\r\n\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShould I be a trouble to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I am little?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are little and tender. It is only great, strong people that should\r\ntravel. But don\u2019t look sad, my little girl; it breaks my heart. Papa, will soon\r\ncome back to his Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed, I am not sad, scarcely at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly would be sorry to give papa pain; would she not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSorrier than sorry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen Polly must be cheerful: not cry at parting; not fret afterwards. She must\r\nlook forward to meeting again, and try to be happy meanwhile. Can she do this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will try.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see she will. Farewell, then. It is time to go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow?\u2014just now?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe held up quivering lips. Her father sobbed, but she, I remarked, did not.\r\nHaving put her down, he shook hands with the rest present, and departed.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the street-door closed, she dropped on her knees at a chair with a\r\ncry\u2014\u201cPapa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was low and long; a sort of \u201cWhy hast thou forsaken me?\u201d During an ensuing\r\nspace of some minutes, I perceived she endured agony. She went through, in that\r\nbrief interval of her infant life, emotions such as some never feel; it was in\r\nher constitution: she would have more of such instants if she lived. Nobody\r\nspoke. Mrs. Bretton, being a mother, shed a tear or two. Graham, who was\r\nwriting, lifted up his eyes and gazed at her. I, Lucy Snowe, was calm.\r\n\n\r\nThe little creature, thus left unharassed, did for herself what none other\r\ncould do\u2014contended with an intolerable feeling; and, ere long, in some degree,\r\nrepressed it. That day she would accept solace from none; nor the next day: she\r\ngrew more passive afterwards.\r\n\n\r\nOn the third evening, as she sat on the floor, worn and quiet, Graham, coming\r\nin, took her up gently, without a word. She did not resist: she rather nestled\r\nin his arms, as if weary. When he sat down, she laid her head against him; in a\r\nfew minutes she slept; he carried her upstairs to bed. I was not surprised\r\nthat, the next morning, the first thing she demanded was, \u201cWhere is Mr.\r\nGraham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt happened that Graham was not coming to the breakfast-table; he had some\r\nexercises to write for that morning\u2019s class, and had requested his mother to\r\nsend a cup of tea into the study. Polly volunteered to carry it: she must be\r\nbusy about something, look after somebody. The cup was entrusted to her; for,\r\nif restless, she was also careful. As the study was opposite the\r\nbreakfast-room, the doors facing across the passage, my eye followed her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, pausing on the threshold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWriting,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to take breakfast with your mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cToo busy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you want any breakfast?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she deposited the cup on the carpet, like a jailor putting a prisoner\u2019s\r\npitcher of water through his cell-door, and retreated. Presently she returned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you have besides tea\u2014what to eat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnything good. Bring me something particularly nice; that\u2019s a kind little\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe came back to Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, send your boy something good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall choose for him, Polly; what shall my boy have?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe selected a portion of whatever was best on the table; and, ere long, came\r\nback with a whispered request for some marmalade, which was not there. Having\r\ngot it, however, (for Mrs. Bretton refused the pair nothing), Graham was\r\nshortly after heard lauding her to the skies; promising that, when he had a\r\nhouse of his own, she should be his housekeeper, and perhaps\u2014if she showed any\r\nculinary genius\u2014his cook; and, as she did not return, and I went to look after\r\nher, I found Graham and her breakfasting t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\u2014she standing at his\r\nelbow, and sharing his fare: excepting the marmalade, which she delicately\r\nrefused to touch, lest, I suppose, it should appear that she had procured it as\r\nmuch on her own account as his. She constantly evinced these nice perceptions\r\nand delicate instincts.\r\n\n\r\nThe league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was not hastily dissolved; on the\r\ncontrary, it appeared that time and circumstances served rather to cement than\r\nloosen it. Ill-assimilated as the two were in age, sex, pursuits, &c., they\r\nsomehow found a great deal to say to each other. As to Paulina, I observed that\r\nher little character never properly came out, except with young Bretton. As she\r\ngot settled, and accustomed to the house, she proved tractable enough with Mrs.\r\nBretton; but she would sit on a stool at that lady\u2019s feet all day long,\r\nlearning her task, or sewing, or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate, and\r\nnever kindling once to originality, or showing a single gleam of the\r\npeculiarities of her nature. I ceased to watch her under such circumstances:\r\nshe was not interesting. But the moment Graham\u2019s knock sounded of an evening, a\r\nchange occurred; she was instantly at the head of the staircase. Usually her\r\nwelcome was a reprimand or a threat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have not wiped your shoes properly on the mat. I shall tell your mamma.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle busybody! Are you there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014and you can\u2019t reach me: I am higher up than you\u201c (peeping between the\r\nrails of the banister; she could not look over them).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear boy!\u201d (such was one of her terms for him, adopted in imitation of his\r\nmother.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am fit to faint with fatigue,\u201d declared Graham, leaning against the\r\npassage-wall in seeming exhaustion. \u201cDr. Digby\u201c (the headmaster) \u201chas quite\r\nknocked me up with overwork. Just come down and help me to carry up my books.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you\u2019re cunning!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, Polly\u2014it is positive fact. I\u2019m as weak as a rush. Come down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour eyes are quiet like the cat\u2019s, but you\u2019ll spring.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpring? Nothing of the kind: it isn\u2019t in me. Come down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I may\u2014if you\u2019ll promise not to touch\u2014not to snatch me up, and not to\r\nwhirl me round.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI? I couldn\u2019t do it!\u201d (sinking into a chair.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen put the books down on the first step, and go three yards off.\u201c\r\n\n\r\nThis being done, she descended warily, and not taking her eyes from the feeble\r\nGraham. Of course her approach always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life:\r\nthe game of romps was sure to be exacted. Sometimes she would be angry;\r\nsometimes the matter was allowed to pass smoothly, and we could hear her say as\r\nshe led him up-stairs: \u201cNow, my dear boy, come and take your tea\u2014I am sure you\r\nmust want something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was sufficiently comical to observe her as she sat beside Graham, while he\r\ntook that meal. In his absence she was a still personage, but with him the most\r\nofficious, fidgety little body possible. I often wished she would mind herself\r\nand be tranquil; but no\u2014herself was forgotten in him: he could not be\r\nsufficiently well waited on, nor carefully enough looked after; he was more\r\nthan the Grand Turk in her estimation. She would gradually assemble the various\r\nplates before him, and, when one would suppose all he could possibly desire was\r\nwithin his reach, she would find out something else: \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d she would whisper\r\nto Mrs. Bretton,\u2014\u201cperhaps your son would like a little cake\u2014sweet cake, you\r\nknow\u2014there is some in there\u201c (pointing to the sideboard cupboard). Mrs.\r\nBretton, as a rule, disapproved of sweet cake at tea, but still the request was\r\nurged,\u2014\u201cOne little piece\u2014only for him\u2014as he goes to school: girls\u2014such as me\r\nand Miss Snowe\u2014don\u2019t need treats, but he would like it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham did like it very well, and almost always got it. To do him justice, he\r\nwould have shared his prize with her to whom he owed it; but that was never\r\nallowed: to insist, was to ruffle her for the evening. To stand by his knee,\r\nand monopolize his talk and notice, was the reward she wanted\u2014not a share of\r\nthe cake.\r\n\n\r\nWith curious readiness did she adapt herself to such themes as interested him.\r\nOne would have thought the child had no mind or life of her own, but must\r\nnecessarily live, move, and have her being in another: now that her father was\r\ntaken from her, she nestled to Graham, and seemed to feel by his feelings: to\r\nexist in his existence. She learned the names of all his schoolfellows in a\r\ntrice: she got by heart their characters as given from his lips: a single\r\ndescription of an individual seemed to suffice. She never forgot, or confused\r\nidentities: she would talk with him the whole evening about people she had\r\nnever seen, and appear completely to realise their aspect, manners, and\r\ndispositions. Some she learned to mimic: an under-master, who was an aversion\r\nof young Bretton\u2019s, had, it seems, some peculiarities, which she caught up in a\r\nmoment from Graham\u2019s representation, and rehearsed for his amusement; this,\r\nhowever, Mrs. Bretton disapproved and forbade.\r\n\n\r\nThe pair seldom quarrelled; yet once a rupture occurred, in which her feelings\r\nreceived a severe shock.\r\n\n\r\nOne day Graham, on the occasion of his birthday, had some friends\u2014lads of his\r\nown age\u2014to dine with him. Paulina took much interest in the coming of these\r\nfriends; she had frequently heard of them; they were amongst those of whom\r\nGraham oftenest spoke. After dinner, the young gentlemen were left by\r\nthemselves in the dining-room, where they soon became very merry and made a\r\ngood deal of noise. Chancing to pass through the hall, I found Paulina sitting\r\nalone on the lowest step of the staircase, her eyes fixed on the glossy panels\r\nof the dining-room door, where the reflection of the hall-lamp was shining; her\r\nlittle brow knit in anxious meditation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular; only I wish that door was clear glass\u2014that I might see\r\nthrough it. The boys seem very cheerful, and I want to go to them: I want to be\r\nwith Graham, and watch his friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat hinders you from going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI feel afraid: but may I try, do you think? May I knock at the door, and ask\r\nto be let in?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought perhaps they might not object to have her as a playmate, and\r\ntherefore encouraged the attempt.\r\n\n\r\nShe knocked\u2014too faintly at first to be heard, but on a second essay the door\r\nunclosed; Graham\u2019s head appeared; he looked in high spirits, but impatient.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, you little monkey?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo come to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you indeed? As if I would be troubled with you! Away to mamma and Mistress\r\nSnowe, and tell them to put you to bed.\u201d The auburn head and bright flushed\r\nface vanished,\u2014the door shut peremptorily. She was stunned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy does he speak so? He never spoke so before,\u201d she said in consternation.\r\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, Polly; but Graham is busy with his school-friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he likes them better than me! He turns me away now they are here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had some thoughts of consoling her, and of improving the occasion by\r\ninculcating some of those maxims of philosophy whereof I had ever a tolerable\r\nstock ready for application. She stopped me, however, by putting her fingers in\r\nher ears at the first words I uttered, and then lying down on the mat with her\r\nface against the flags; nor could either Warren or the cook root her from that\r\nposition: she was allowed to lie, therefore, till she chose to rise of her own\r\naccord.\r\n\n\r\nGraham forgot his impatience the same evening, and would have accosted her as\r\nusual when his friends were gone, but she wrenched herself from his hand; her\r\neye quite flashed; she would not bid him good-night; she would not look in his\r\nface. The next day he treated her with indifference, and she grew like a bit of\r\nmarble. The day after, he teased her to know what was the matter; her lips\r\nwould not unclose. Of course he could not feel real anger on his side: the\r\nmatch was too unequal in every way; he tried soothing and coaxing. \u201cWhy was she\r\nso angry? What had he done?\u201d By-and-by tears answered him; he petted her, and\r\nthey were friends. But she was one on whom such incidents were not lost: I\r\nremarked that never after this rebuff did she seek him, or follow him, or in\r\nany way solicit his notice. I told her once to carry a book or some other\r\narticle to Graham when he was shut up in his study.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall wait till he comes out,\u201d said she, proudly; \u201cI don\u2019t choose to give\r\nhim the trouble of rising to open the door.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYoung Bretton had a favourite pony on which he often rode out; from the window\r\nshe always watched his departure and return. It was her ambition to be\r\npermitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony; but far be it from\r\nher to ask such a favour. One day she descended to the yard to watch him\r\ndismount; as she leaned against the gate, the longing wish for the indulgence\r\nof a ride glittered in her eye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Polly, will you have a canter?\u201d asked Graham, half carelessly.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose she thought he was too careless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said she, turning away with the utmost coolness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d pursued he. \u201cYou will like it, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I should care a fig about it,\u201d was the response.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is not true. You told Lucy Snowe you longed to have a ride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe is a tatter-box,\u201d I heard her say (her imperfect\r\narticulation was the least precocious thing she had about her); and with this;\r\nshe walked into the house.\r\n\n\r\nGraham, coming in soon after, observed to his mother,\u2014\u201cMamma, I believe that\r\ncreature is a changeling: she is a perfect cabinet of oddities; but I should be\r\ndull without her: she amuses me a great deal more than you or Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said Paulina to me (she had now got into the habit of\r\noccasionally chatting with me when we were alone in our room at night), \u201cdo you\r\nknow on what day in the week I like Graham best?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can I possibly know anything so strange? Is there one day out of the seven\r\nwhen he is otherwise than on the other six?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure! Can\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you know? I find him the most excellent on a\r\nSunday; then we have him the whole day, and he is quiet, and, in the evening,\r\nso kind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis observation was not altogether groundless: going to church, &c., kept\r\nGraham quiet on the Sunday, and the evening he generally dedicated to a serene,\r\nthough rather indolent sort of enjoyment by the parlour fireside. He would take\r\npossession of the couch, and then he would call Polly.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was a boy not quite as other boys are; all his delight did not lie in\r\naction: he was capable of some intervals of contemplation; he could take a\r\npleasure too in reading, nor was his selection of books wholly indiscriminate:\r\nthere were glimmerings of characteristic preference, and even of instinctive\r\ntaste in the choice. He rarely, it is true, remarked on what he read, but I\r\nhave seen him sit and think of it.\r\n\n\r\nPolly, being near him, kneeling on a little cushion or the carpet, a\r\nconversation would begin in murmurs, not inaudible, though subdued. I caught a\r\nsnatch of their tenor now and then; and, in truth, some influence better and\r\nfiner than that of every day, seemed to soothe Graham at such times into no\r\nungentle mood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you learned any hymns this week, Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have learned a very pretty one, four verses long. Shall I say it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak nicely, then: don\u2019t be in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe hymn being rehearsed, or rather half-chanted, in a little singing voice,\r\nGraham would take exceptions at the manner, and proceed to give a lesson in\r\nrecitation. She was quick in learning, apt in imitating; and, besides, her\r\npleasure was to please Graham: she proved a ready scholar. To the hymn would\r\nsucceed some reading\u2014perhaps a chapter in the Bible; correction was seldom\r\nrequired here, for the child could read any simple narrative chapter very well;\r\nand, when the subject was such as she could understand and take an interest in,\r\nher expression and emphasis were something remarkable. Joseph cast into the\r\npit; the calling of Samuel; Daniel in the lions\u2019 den;\u2014these were favourite\r\npassages: of the first especially she seemed perfectly to feel the pathos.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor Jacob!\u201d she would sometimes say, with quivering lips. \u201cHow he loved his\r\nson Joseph! As much,\u201d she once added\u2014\u201cas much, Graham, as I love you: if you\r\nwere to die\u201c (and she re-opened the book, sought the verse, and read), \u201cI\r\nshould refuse to be comforted, and go down into the grave to you mourning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith these words she gathered Graham in her little arms, drawing his\r\nlong-tressed head towards her. The action, I remember, struck me as strangely\r\nrash; exciting the feeling one might experience on seeing an animal dangerous\r\nby nature, and but half-tamed by art, too heedlessly fondled. Not that I feared\r\nGraham would hurt, or very roughly check her; but I thought she ran risk of\r\nincurring such a careless, impatient repulse, as would be worse almost to her\r\nthan a blow. On the whole, however, these demonstrations were borne passively:\r\nsometimes even a sort of complacent wonder at her earnest partiality would\r\nsmile not unkindly in his eyes. Once he said:\u2014\u201cYou like me almost as well as if\r\nyou were my little sister, Polly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I do like you,\u201d said she; \u201cI do like you very much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was not long allowed the amusement of this study of character. She had\r\nscarcely been at Bretton two months, when a letter came from Mr. Home,\r\nsignifying that he was now settled amongst his maternal kinsfolk on the\r\nContinent; that, as England was become wholly distasteful to him, he had no\r\nthoughts of returning hither, perhaps, for years; and that he wished his little\r\ngirl to join him immediately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how she will take this news?\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, when she had read\r\nthe letter. I wondered, too, and I took upon myself to communicate it.\r\n\n\r\nRepairing to the drawing-room\u2014in which calm and decorated apartment she was\r\nfond of being alone, and where she could be implicitly trusted, for she\r\nfingered nothing, or rather soiled nothing she fingered\u2014I found her seated,\r\nlike a little Odalisque, on a couch, half shaded by the drooping draperies of\r\nthe window near. She seemed happy; all her appliances for occupation were about\r\nher; the white wood workbox, a shred or two of muslin, an end or two of ribbon\r\ncollected for conversion into doll-millinery. The doll, duly night-capped and\r\nnight-gowned, lay in its cradle; she was rocking it to sleep, with an air of\r\nthe most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and somnolent faculties;\r\nher eyes, at the same time, being engaged with a picture-book, which lay open\r\non her lap.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said she in a whisper, \u201cthis is a wonderful book. Candace\u201d (the\r\ndoll, christened by Graham; for, indeed, its begrimed complexion gave it much\r\nof an Ethiopian aspect)\u2014\u201cCandace is asleep now, and I may tell you about it;\r\nonly we must both speak low, lest she should waken. This book was given me by\r\nGraham; it tells about distant countries, a long, long way from England, which\r\nno traveller can reach without sailing thousands of miles over the sea. Wild\r\nmen live in these countries, Miss Snowe, who wear clothes different from ours:\r\nindeed, some of them wear scarcely any clothes, for the sake of being cool, you\r\nknow; for they have very hot weather. Here is a picture of thousands gathered\r\nin a desolate place\u2014a plain, spread with sand\u2014round a man in black,\u2014a good,\r\ngood Englishman\u2014a missionary, who is preaching to them under a\r\npalm-tree.\u201d (She showed a little coloured cut to that effect.) \u201cAnd here are\r\npictures\u201d (she went on) \u201cmore stranger\u201d (grammar was occasionally forgotten)\r\n\u201cthan that. There is the wonderful Great Wall of China; here is a Chinese lady,\r\nwith a foot littler than mine. There is a wild horse of Tartary; and here, most\r\nstrange of all\u2014is a land of ice and snow, without green fields, woods, or\r\ngardens. In this land, they found some mammoth bones: there are no mammoths\r\nnow. You don\u2019t know what it was; but I can tell you, because Graham told me. A\r\nmighty, goblin creature, as high as this room, and as long as the hall; but not\r\na fierce, flesh-eating thing, Graham thinks. He believes, if I met one in a\r\nforest, it would not kill me, unless I came quite in its way; when it would\r\ntrample me down amongst the bushes, as I might tread on a grasshopper in a\r\nhayfield without knowing it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus she rambled on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cshould you like to travel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot just yet,\u201d was the prudent answer; \u201cbut perhaps in twenty years, when I am\r\ngrown a woman, as tall as Mrs. Bretton, I may travel with Graham. We intend\r\ngoing to Switzerland, and climbing Mount Blanck; and some day we shall sail\r\nover to South America, and walk to the top of Kim-kim-borazo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how would you like to travel now, if your papa was with you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer reply\u2014not given till after a pause\u2014evinced one of those unexpected turns of\r\ntemper peculiar to her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the good of talking in that silly way?\u201d said she. \u201cWhy do you mention\r\npapa? What is papa to you? I was just beginning to be happy, and not think\r\nabout him so much; and there it will be all to do over again!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer lip trembled. I hastened to disclose the fact of a letter having been\r\nreceived, and to mention the directions given that she and Harriet should\r\nimmediately rejoin this dear papa. \u201cNow, Polly, are you not glad?\u201d I added.\r\n\n\r\nShe made no answer. She dropped her book and ceased to rock her doll; she gazed\r\nat me with gravity and earnestness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall not you like to go to papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said at last in that trenchant manner she usually employed in\r\nspeaking to me; and which was quite different from that she used with Mrs.\r\nBretton, and different again from the one dedicated to Graham. I wished to\r\nascertain more of what she thought but no: she would converse no more.\r\nHastening to Mrs. Bretton, she questioned her, and received the confirmation of\r\nmy news. The weight and importance of these tidings kept her perfectly serious\r\nthe whole day. In the evening, at the moment Graham\u2019s entrance was heard below,\r\nI found her at my side. She began to arrange a locket-ribbon about my neck, she\r\ndisplaced and replaced the comb in my hair; while thus busied, Graham entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him by-and-by,\u201d she whispered; \u201ctell him I am going.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of tea-time I made the desired communication. Graham, it chanced,\r\nwas at that time greatly preoccupied about some school-prize, for which he was\r\ncompeting. The news had to be told twice before it took proper hold of his\r\nattention, and even then he dwelt on it but momently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly going? What a pity! Dear little Mousie, I shall be sorry to lose her:\r\nshe must come to us again, mamma.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd hastily swallowing his tea, he took a candle and a small table to himself\r\nand his books, and was soon buried in study.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle Mousie\u201d crept to his side, and lay down on the carpet at his feet, her\r\nface to the floor; mute and motionless she kept that post and position till\r\nbed-time. Once I saw Graham\u2014wholly unconscious of her proximity\u2014push her with\r\nhis restless foot. She receded an inch or two. A minute after one little hand\r\nstole out from beneath her face, to which it had been pressed, and softly\r\ncaressed the heedless foot. When summoned by her nurse she rose and departed\r\nvery obediently, having bid us all a subdued good-night.\r\n\n\r\nI will not say that I dreaded going to bed, an hour later; yet I certainly went\r\nwith an unquiet anticipation that I should find that child in no peaceful\r\nsleep. The forewarning of my instinct was but fulfilled, when I discovered her,\r\nall cold and vigilant, perched like a white bird on the outside of the bed. I\r\nscarcely knew how to accost her; she was not to be managed like another child.\r\nShe, however, accosted me. As I closed the door, and put the light on the\r\ndressing-table, she turned to me with these words:\u2014\u201cI cannot\u2014cannot\r\nsleep; and in this way I cannot\u2014cannot live!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI asked what ailed her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDedful miz-er-y!\u201d said she, with her piteous lisp.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I call Mrs. Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is downright silly,\u201d was her impatient reply; and, indeed, I well knew\r\nthat if she had heard Mrs. Bretton\u2019s foot approach, she would have nestled\r\nquiet as a mouse under the bedclothes. Whilst lavishing her eccentricities\r\nregardlessly before me\u2014for whom she professed scarcely the semblance of\r\naffection\u2014she never showed my godmother one glimpse of her inner self: for her,\r\nshe was nothing but a docile, somewhat quaint little maiden. I examined her;\r\nher cheek was crimson; her dilated eye was both troubled and glowing, and\r\npainfully restless: in this state it was obvious she must not be left till\r\nmorning. I guessed how the case stood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to bid Graham good-night again?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is not gone to\r\nhis room yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe at once stretched out her little arms to be lifted. Folding a shawl round\r\nher, I carried her back to the drawing-room. Graham was just coming out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe cannot sleep without seeing and speaking to you once more,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\r\ndoes not like the thought of leaving you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoilt her,\u201d said he, taking her from me with good humour, and kissing\r\nher little hot face and burning lips. \u201cPolly, you care for me more than for\r\npapa, now\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do care for you, but you care nothing for me,\u201d was her whisper.\r\n\n\r\nShe was assured to the contrary, again kissed, restored to me, and I carried\r\nher away; but, alas! not soothed.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I thought she could listen to me, I said\u2014\u201cPaulina, you should not grieve\r\nthat Graham does not care for you so much as you care for him. It must be so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer lifted and questioning eyes asked why.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is a boy and you are a girl; he is sixteen and you are only six;\r\nhis nature is strong and gay, and yours is otherwise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I love him so much; he should love me a little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe does. He is fond of you. You are his favourite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I Graham\u2019s favourite?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, more than any little child I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe assurance soothed her; she smiled in her anguish.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I continued, \u201cdon\u2019t fret, and don\u2019t expect too much of him, or else he\r\nwill feel you to be troublesome, and then it is all over.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll over!\u201d she echoed softly; \u201cthen I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll try to be good, Lucy\r\nSnowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI put her to bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he forgive me this one time?\u201d she asked, as I undressed myself. I assured\r\nher that he would; that as yet he was by no means alienated; that she had only\r\nto be careful for the future.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no future,\u201d said she: \u201cI am going. Shall I ever\u2014ever\u2014see him again,\r\nafter I leave England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI returned an encouraging response. The candle being extinguished, a still\r\nhalf-hour elapsed. I thought her asleep, when the little white shape once more\r\nlifted itself in the crib, and the small voice asked\u2014\u201cDo you like Graham, Miss\r\nSnowe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLike him! Yes, a little.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly a little! Do you like him as I do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not. No: not as you do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like him much?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI told you I liked him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very\r\nmuch: he is full of faults.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll boys are.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMore than girls?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anybody perfect; and as to\r\nlikes and dislikes, we should be friendly to all, and worship none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you a wise person?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean to try to be so. Go to sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot go to sleep. Have you no pain just here\u201d (laying her elfish\r\nhand on her elfish breast,) \u201cwhen you think you shall have to leave\r\nGraham; for your home is not here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely, Polly,\u201d said I, \u201cyou should not feel so much pain when you are very\r\nsoon going to rejoin your father. Have you forgotten him? Do you no longer wish\r\nto be his little companion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDead silence succeeded this question.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChild, lie down and sleep,\u201d I urged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy bed is cold,\u201d said she. \u201cI can\u2019t warm it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI saw the little thing shiver. \u201cCome to me,\u201d I said, wishing, yet scarcely\r\nhoping, that she would comply: for she was a most strange, capricious, little\r\ncreature, and especially whimsical with me. She came, however, instantly, like\r\na small ghost gliding over the carpet. I took her in. She was chill: I warmed\r\nher in my arms. She trembled nervously; I soothed her. Thus tranquillized and\r\ncherished she at last slumbered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA very unique child,\u201d thought I, as I viewed her sleeping countenance by the\r\nfitful moonlight, and cautiously and softly wiped her glittering eyelids and\r\nher wet cheeks with my handkerchief. \u201cHow will she get through this world, or\r\nbattle with this life? How will she bear the shocks and repulses, the\r\nhumiliations and desolations, which books, and my own reason, tell me are\r\nprepared for all flesh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe departed the next day; trembling like a leaf when she took leave, but\r\nexercising self-command.\r\n\n"}
{"5": "\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nMISS MARCHMONT.\n\r\nOn quitting Bretton, which I did a few weeks after Paulina\u2019s departure\u2014little\r\nthinking then I was never again to visit it; never more to tread its calm old\r\nstreets\u2014I betook myself home, having been absent six months. It will be\r\nconjectured that I was of course glad to return to the bosom of my kindred.\r\nWell! the amiable conjecture does no harm, and may therefore be safely left\r\nuncontradicted. Far from saying nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to\r\npicture me, for the next eight years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon\r\nweather, in a harbour still as glass\u2014the steersman stretched on the little\r\ndeck, his face up to heaven, his eyes closed: buried, if you will, in a long\r\nprayer. A great many women and girls are supposed to pass their lives something\r\nin that fashion; why not I with the rest?\r\n\n\r\nPicture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy, stretched on a cushioned deck,\r\nwarmed with constant sunshine, rocked by breezes indolently soft. However, it\r\ncannot be concealed that, in that case, I must somehow have fallen overboard,\r\nor that there must have been wreck at last. I too well remember a time\u2014a long\r\ntime\u2014of cold, of danger, of contention. To this hour, when I have the\r\nnightmare, it repeats the rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat, and\r\ntheir icy pressure on my lungs. I even know there was a storm, and that not of\r\none hour nor one day. For many days and nights neither sun nor stars appeared;\r\nwe cast with our own hands the tackling out of the ship; a heavy tempest lay on\r\nus; all hope that we should be saved was taken away. In fine, the ship was\r\nlost, the crew perished.\r\n\n\r\nAs far as I recollect, I complained to no one about these troubles. Indeed, to\r\nwhom could I complain? Of Mrs. Bretton I had long lost sight. Impediments,\r\nraised by others, had, years ago, come in the way of our intercourse, and cut\r\nit off. Besides, time had brought changes for her, too: the handsome property\r\nof which she was left guardian for her son, and which had been chiefly invested\r\nin some joint-stock undertaking, had melted, it was said, to a fraction of its\r\noriginal amount. Graham, I learned from incidental rumours, had adopted a\r\nprofession; both he and his mother were gone from Bretton, and were understood\r\nto be now in London. Thus, there remained no possibility of dependence on\r\nothers; to myself alone could I look. I know not that I was of a self-reliant\r\nor active nature; but self-reliance and exertion were forced upon me by\r\ncircumstances, as they are upon thousands besides; and when Miss Marchmont, a\r\nmaiden lady of our neighbourhood, sent for me, I obeyed her behest, in the hope\r\nthat she might assign me some task I could undertake.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Marchmont was a woman of fortune, and lived in a handsome residence; but\r\nshe was a rheumatic cripple, impotent, foot and hand, and had been so for\r\ntwenty years. She always sat upstairs: her drawing-room adjoined her bed-room.\r\nI had often heard of Miss Marchmont, and of her peculiarities (she had the\r\ncharacter of being very eccentric), but till now had never seen her. I found\r\nher a furrowed, grey-haired woman, grave with solitude, stern with long\r\naffliction, irritable also, and perhaps exacting. It seemed that a maid, or\r\nrather companion, who had waited on her for some years, was about to be\r\nmarried; and she, hearing of my bereaved lot, had sent for me, with the idea\r\nthat I might supply this person\u2019s place. She made the proposal to me after tea,\r\nas she and I sat alone by her fireside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will not be an easy life;\u201d said she candidly, \u201cfor I require a good deal of\r\nattention, and you will be much confined; yet, perhaps, contrasted with the\r\nexistence you have lately led, it may appear tolerable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI reflected. Of course it ought to appear tolerable, I argued inwardly; but\r\nsomehow, by some strange fatality, it would not. To live here, in this close\r\nroom, the watcher of suffering\u2014sometimes, perhaps, the butt of temper\u2014through\r\nall that was to come of my youth; while all that was gone had passed, to say\r\nthe least, not blissfully! My heart sunk one moment, then it revived; for\r\nthough I forced myself to realise evils, I think I was too prosaic to\r\nidealise, and consequently to exaggerate them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy doubt is whether I should have strength for the undertaking,\u201d I observed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is my own scruple,\u201d said she; \u201cfor you look a worn-out creature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I did. I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed\r\nvision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was\r\nchiefly external: I still felt life at life\u2019s sources.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat else have you in view\u2014anything?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing clear as yet: but I may find something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo you imagine: perhaps you are right. Try your own method, then; and if it\r\ndoes not succeed, test mine. The chance I have offered shall be left open to\r\nyou for three months.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was kind. I told her so, and expressed my gratitude. While I was speaking,\r\na paroxysm of pain came on. I ministered to her; made the necessary\r\napplications, according to her directions, and, by the time she was relieved, a\r\nsort of intimacy was already formed between us. I, for my part, had learned\r\nfrom the manner in which she bore this attack, that she was a firm, patient\r\nwoman (patient under physical pain, though sometimes perhaps excitable under\r\nlong mental canker); and she, from the good-will with which I succoured her,\r\ndiscovered that she could influence my sympathies (such as they were). She sent\r\nfor me the next day; for five or six successive days she claimed my company.\r\nCloser acquaintance, while it developed both faults and eccentricities, opened,\r\nat the same time, a view of a character I could respect. Stern and even morose\r\nas she sometimes was, I could wait on her and sit beside her with that calm\r\nwhich always blesses us when we are sensible that our manners, presence,\r\ncontact, please and soothe the persons we serve. Even when she scolded me\u2014which\r\nshe did, now and then, very tartly\u2014it was in such a way as did not humiliate,\r\nand left no sting; it was rather like an irascible mother rating her daughter,\r\nthan a harsh mistress lecturing a dependant: lecture, indeed, she could not,\r\nthough she could occasionally storm. Moreover, a vein of reason ever ran\r\nthrough her passion: she was logical even when fierce. Ere long a growing sense\r\nof attachment began to present the thought of staying with her as companion in\r\nquite a new light; in another week I had agreed to remain.\r\n\n\r\nTwo hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a crippled old woman, my\r\nmistress, my friend, my all. Her service was my duty\u2014her pain, my suffering\u2014her\r\nrelief, my hope\u2014her anger, my punishment\u2014her regard, my reward. I forgot that\r\nthere were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an ever-changing sky outside the\r\nsteam-dimmed lattice of this sick chamber; I was almost content to forget it.\r\nAll within me became narrowed to my lot. Tame and still by habit, disciplined\r\nby destiny, I demanded no walks in the fresh air; my appetite needed no more\r\nthan the tiny messes served for the invalid. In addition, she gave me the\r\noriginality of her character to study: the steadiness of her virtues, I will\r\nadd, the power of her passions, to admire; the truth of her feelings to trust.\r\nAll these things she had, and for these things I clung to her.\r\n\n\r\nFor these things I would have crawled on with her for twenty years, if for\r\ntwenty years longer her life of endurance had been protracted. But another\r\ndecree was written. It seemed I must be stimulated into action. I must be\r\ngoaded, driven, stung, forced to energy. My little morsel of human affection,\r\nwhich I prized as if it were a solid pearl, must melt in my fingers and slip\r\nthence like a dissolving hailstone. My small adopted duty must be snatched from\r\nmy easily contented conscience. I had wanted to compromise with Fate: to escape\r\noccasional great agonies by submitting to a whole life of privation and small\r\npains. Fate would not so be pacified; nor would Providence sanction this\r\nshrinking sloth and cowardly indolence.\r\n\n\r\nOne February night\u2014I remember it well\u2014there came a voice near Miss Marchmont\u2019s\r\nhouse, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps, only by one. After a\r\ncalm winter, storms were ushering in the spring. I had put Miss Marchmont to\r\nbed; I sat at the fireside sewing. The wind was wailing at the windows; it had\r\nwailed all day; but, as night deepened, it took a new tone\u2014an accent keen,\r\npiercing, almost articulate to the ear; a plaint, piteous and disconsolate to\r\nthe nerves, trilled in every gust.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush! hush!\u201d I said in my disturbed mind, dropping my work, and making a\r\nvain effort to stop my ears against that subtle, searching cry. I had heard\r\nthat very voice ere this, and compulsory observation had forced on me a theory\r\nas to what it boded. Three times in the course of my life, events had taught me\r\nthat these strange accents in the storm\u2014this restless, hopeless cry\u2014denote a\r\ncoming state of the atmosphere unpropitious to life. Epidemic diseases, I\r\nbelieved, were often heralded by a gasping, sobbing, tormented, long-lamenting\r\neast wind. Hence, I inferred, arose the legend of the Banshee. I fancied, too,\r\nI had noticed\u2014but was not philosopher enough to know whether there was any\r\nconnection between the circumstances\u2014that we often at the same time hear of\r\ndisturbed volcanic action in distant parts of the world; of rivers suddenly\r\nrushing above their banks; and of strange high tides flowing furiously in on\r\nlow sea-coasts. \u201cOur globe,\u201d I had said to myself, \u201cseems at such periods torn\r\nand disordered; the feeble amongst us wither in her distempered breath, rushing\r\nhot from steaming volcanoes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI listened and trembled; Miss Marchmont slept.\r\n\n\r\nAbout midnight, the storm in one half-hour fell to a dead calm. The fire, which\r\nhad been burning dead, glowed up vividly. I felt the air change, and become\r\nkeen. Raising blind and curtain, I looked out, and saw in the stars the keen\r\nsparkle of a sharp frost.\r\n\n\r\nTurning away, the object that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake, lifting her\r\nhead from the pillow, and regarding me with unusual earnestness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it a fine night?\u201d she asked.\r\n\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d she said; \u201cfor I feel so strong, so well. Raise me. I feel\r\nyoung to-night,\u201d she continued: \u201cyoung, light-hearted, and happy. What if my\r\ncomplaint be about to take a turn, and I am yet destined to enjoy health? It\r\nwould be a miracle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd these are not the days of miracles,\u201d I thought to myself, and wondered to\r\nhear her talk so. She went on directing her conversation to the past, and\r\nseeming to recall its incidents, scenes, and personages, with singular\r\nvividness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI love Memory to-night,\u201d she said: \u201cI prize her as my best friend. She is just\r\nnow giving me a deep delight: she is bringing back to my heart, in warm and\r\nbeautiful life, realities\u2014not mere empty ideas, but what were once realities,\r\nand that I long have thought decayed, dissolved, mixed in with grave-mould. I\r\npossess just now the hours, the thoughts, the hopes of my youth. I renew the\r\nlove of my life\u2014its only love\u2014almost its only affection; for I am not a\r\nparticularly good woman: I am not amiable. Yet I have had my feelings, strong\r\nand concentrated; and these feelings had their object; which, in its single\r\nself, was dear to me, as to the majority of men and women, are all the\r\nunnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard. While I loved, and\r\nwhile I was loved, what an existence I enjoyed! What a glorious year I can\r\nrecall\u2014how bright it comes back to me! What a living spring\u2014what a warm, glad\r\nsummer\u2014what soft moonlight, silvering the autumn evenings\u2014what strength of hope\r\nunder the ice-bound waters and frost-hoar fields of that year\u2019s winter! Through\r\nthat year my heart lived with Frank\u2019s heart. O my noble Frank\u2014my faithful\r\nFrank\u2014my good Frank! so much better than myself\u2014his standard in all\r\nthings so much higher! This I can now see and say: if few women have suffered\r\nas I did in his loss, few have enjoyed what I did in his love. It was a far\r\nbetter kind of love than common; I had no doubts about it or him: it was such a\r\nlove as honoured, protected, and elevated, no less than it gladdened her to\r\nwhom it was given. Let me now ask, just at this moment, when my mind is so\r\nstrangely clear,\u2014let me reflect why it was taken from me? For what crime was I\r\ncondemned, after twelve months of bliss, to undergo thirty years of sorrow?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d she continued after a pause: \u201cI cannot\u2014cannot see the\r\nreason; yet at this hour I can say with sincerity, what I never tried to say\r\nbefore, Inscrutable God, Thy will be done! And at this moment I can believe\r\nthat death will restore me to Frank. I never believed it till now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead, then?\u201d I inquired in a low voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d she said, \u201cone happy Christmas Eve I dressed and decorated\r\nmyself, expecting my lover, very soon to be my husband, would come that night\r\nto visit me. I sat down to wait. Once more I see that moment\u2014I see the snow\r\ntwilight stealing through the window over which the curtain was not dropped,\r\nfor I designed to watch him ride up the white walk; I see and feel the soft\r\nfirelight warming me, playing on my silk dress, and fitfully showing me my own\r\nyoung figure in a glass. I see the moon of a calm winter night, float full,\r\nclear, and cold, over the inky mass of shrubbery, and the silvered turf of my\r\ngrounds. I wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my breast.\r\nThe flames had died in the fire, but it was a bright mass yet; the moon was\r\nmounting high, but she was still visible from the lattice; the clock neared\r\nten; he rarely tarried later than this, but once or twice he had been delayed\r\nso long.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould he for once fail me? No\u2014not even for once; and now he was coming\u2014and\r\ncoming fast\u2014to atone for lost time. \u2018Frank! you furious rider,\u2019 I said\r\ninwardly, listening gladly, yet anxiously, to his approaching gallop, \u2018you\r\nshall be rebuked for this: I will tell you it is my neck you are putting\r\nin peril; for whatever is yours is, in a dearer and tenderer sense, mine.\u2019\r\nThere he was: I saw him; but I think tears were in my eyes, my sight was so\r\nconfused. I saw the horse; I heard it stamp\u2014I saw at least a mass; I heard a\r\nclamour. Was it a horse? or what heavy, dragging thing was it, crossing,\r\nstrangely dark, the lawn. How could I name that thing in the moonlight before\r\nme? or how could I utter the feeling which rose in my soul?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could only run out. A great animal\u2014truly, Frank\u2019s black horse\u2014stood\r\ntrembling, panting, snorting before the door; a man held it, Frank, as I\r\nthought.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is the matter?\u2019 I demanded. Thomas, my own servant, answered by saying\r\nsharply, \u2018Go into the house, madam.\u2019 And then calling to another servant, who\r\ncame hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by some instinct, \u2018Ruth, take\r\nmissis into the house directly.\u2019 But I was kneeling down in the snow, beside\r\nsomething that lay there\u2014something that I had seen dragged along the\r\nground\u2014something that sighed, that groaned on my breast, as I lifted and drew\r\nit to me. He was not dead; he was not quite unconscious. I had him carried in;\r\nI refused to be ordered about and thrust from him. I was quite collected\r\nenough, not only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others. They had\r\nbegun by trying to treat me like a child, as they always do with people struck\r\nby God\u2019s hand; but I gave place to none except the surgeon; and when he had\r\ndone what he could, I took my dying Frank to myself. He had strength to fold me\r\nin his arms; he had power to speak my name; he heard me as I prayed over him\r\nvery softly; he felt me as I tenderly and fondly comforted him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Maria,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am dying in Paradise.\u2019 He spent his last breath in\r\nfaithful words for me. When the dawn of Christmas morning broke, my Frank was\r\nwith God.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d she went on, \u201chappened thirty years ago. I have suffered since. I\r\ndoubt if I have made the best use of all my calamities. Soft, amiable natures\r\nthey would have refined to saintliness; of strong, evil spirits they would have\r\nmade demons; as for me, I have only been a woe-struck and selfish woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have done much good,\u201d I said; for she was noted for her liberal\r\nalmsgiving.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not withheld money, you mean, where it could assuage affliction. What\r\nof that? It cost me no effort or pang to give. But I think from this day I am\r\nabout to enter a better frame of mind, to prepare myself for reunion with\r\nFrank. You see I still think of Frank more than of God; and unless it be\r\ncounted that in thus loving the creature so much, so long, and so exclusively,\r\nI have not at least blasphemed the Creator, small is my chance of salvation.\r\nWhat do you think, Lucy, of these things? Be my chaplain, and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis question I could not answer: I had no words. It seemed as if she thought I\r\nhad answered it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery right, my child. We should acknowledge God merciful, but not always for\r\nus comprehensible. We should accept our own lot, whatever it be, and try to\r\nrender happy that of others. Should we not? Well, to-morrow I will begin by\r\ntrying to make you happy. I will endeavour to do something for you, Lucy:\r\nsomething that will benefit you when I am dead. My head aches now with talking\r\ntoo much; still I am happy. Go to bed. The clock strikes two. How late you sit\r\nup; or rather how late I, in my selfishness, keep you up. But go now; have no\r\nmore anxiety for me; I feel I shall rest well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe composed herself as if to slumber. I, too, retired to my crib in a closet\r\nwithin her room. The night passed in quietness; quietly her doom must at last\r\nhave come: peacefully and painlessly: in the morning she was found without\r\nlife, nearly cold, but all calm and undisturbed. Her previous excitement of\r\nspirits and change of mood had been the prelude of a fit; one stroke sufficed\r\nto sever the thread of an existence so long fretted by affliction.\r\n\n"}
{"6": "\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTURNING A NEW LEAF.\n\r\nMy mistress being dead, and I once more alone, I had to look out for a new\r\nplace. About this time I might be a little\u2014a very little\u2014shaken in nerves. I\r\ngrant I was not looking well, but, on the contrary, thin, haggard, and\r\nhollow-eyed; like a sitter-up at night, like an overwrought servant, or a\r\nplaceless person in debt. In debt, however, I was not; nor quite poor; for\r\nthough Miss Marchmont had not had time to benefit me, as, on that last night,\r\nshe said she intended, yet, after the funeral, my wages were duly paid by her\r\nsecond cousin, the heir, an avaricious-looking man, with pinched nose and\r\nnarrow temples, who, indeed, I heard long afterwards, turned out a thorough\r\nmiser: a direct contrast to his generous kinswoman, and a foil to her memory,\r\nblessed to this day by the poor and needy. The possessor, then, of fifteen\r\npounds; of health, though worn, not broken, and of a spirit in similar\r\ncondition; I might still; in comparison with many people, be regarded as\r\noccupying an enviable position. An embarrassing one it was, however, at the\r\nsame time; as I felt with some acuteness on a certain day, of which the\r\ncorresponding one in the next week was to see my departure from my present\r\nabode, while with another I was not provided.\r\n\n\r\nIn this dilemma I went, as a last and sole resource, to see and consult an old\r\nservant of our family; once my nurse, now housekeeper at a grand mansion not\r\nfar from Miss Marchmont\u2019s. I spent some hours with her; she comforted, but knew\r\nnot how to advise me. Still all inward darkness, I left her about twilight; a\r\nwalk of two miles lay before me; it was a clear, frosty night. In spite of my\r\nsolitude, my poverty, and my perplexity, my heart, nourished and nerved with\r\nthe vigour of a youth that had not yet counted twenty-three summers, beat light\r\nand not feebly. Not feebly, I am sure, or I should have trembled in that lonely\r\nwalk, which lay through still fields, and passed neither village nor farmhouse,\r\nnor cottage: I should have quailed in the absence of moonlight, for it was by\r\nthe leading of stars only I traced the dim path; I should have quailed still\r\nmore in the unwonted presence of that which to-night shone in the north, a\r\nmoving mystery\u2014the Aurora Borealis. But this solemn stranger influenced me\r\notherwise than through my fears. Some new power it seemed to bring. I drew in\r\nenergy with the keen, low breeze that blew on its path. A bold thought was sent\r\nto my mind; my mind was made strong to receive it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave this wilderness,\u201d it was said to me, \u201cand go out hence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d was the query.\r\n\n\r\nI had not very far to look; gazing from this country parish in that flat, rich\r\nmiddle of England\u2014I mentally saw within reach what I had never yet beheld with\r\nmy bodily eyes: I saw London.\r\n\n\r\nThe next day I returned to the hall, and asking once more to see the\r\nhousekeeper, I communicated to her my plan.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Barrett was a grave, judicious woman, though she knew little more of the\r\nworld than myself; but grave and judicious as she was, she did not charge me\r\nwith being out of my senses; and, indeed, I had a staid manner of my own which\r\nere now had been as good to me as cloak and hood of hodden grey, since under\r\nits favour I had been enabled to achieve with impunity, and even approbation,\r\ndeeds that, if attempted with an excited and unsettled air, would in some minds\r\nhave stamped me as a dreamer and zealot.\r\n\n\r\nThe housekeeper was slowly propounding some difficulties, while she prepared\r\norange-rind for marmalade, when a child ran past the window and came bounding\r\ninto the room. It was a pretty child, and as it danced, laughing, up to me\u2014for\r\nwe were not strangers (nor, indeed, was its mother\u2014a young married daughter of\r\nthe house\u2014a stranger)\u2014I took it on my knee.\r\n\n\r\nDifferent as were our social positions now, this child\u2019s mother and I had been\r\nschoolfellows, when I was a girl of ten and she a young lady of sixteen; and I\r\nremembered her, good-looking, but dull, in a lower class than mine.\r\n\n\r\nI was admiring the boy\u2019s handsome dark eyes, when the mother, young Mrs. Leigh,\r\nentered. What a beautiful and kind-looking woman was the good-natured and\r\ncomely, but unintellectual, girl become! Wifehood and maternity had changed her\r\nthus, as I have since seen them change others even less promising than she. Me\r\nshe had forgotten. I was changed too, though not, I fear, for the better. I\r\nmade no attempt to recall myself to her memory; why should I? She came for her\r\nson to accompany her in a walk, and behind her followed a nurse, carrying an\r\ninfant. I only mention the incident because, in addressing the nurse, Mrs.\r\nLeigh spoke French (very bad French, by the way, and with an incorrigibly bad\r\naccent, again forcibly reminding me of our school-days): and I found the woman\r\nwas a foreigner. The little boy chattered volubly in French too. When the whole\r\nparty were withdrawn, Mrs. Barrett remarked that her young lady had brought\r\nthat foreign nurse home with her two years ago, on her return from a\r\nContinental excursion; that she was treated almost as well as a governess, and\r\nhad nothing to do but walk out with the baby and chatter French with Master\r\nCharles; \u201cand,\u201d added Mrs. Barrett, \u201cshe says there are many Englishwomen in\r\nforeign families as well placed as she.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI stored up this piece of casual information, as careful housewives store\r\nseemingly worthless shreds and fragments for which their prescient minds\r\nanticipate a possible use some day. Before I left my old friend, she gave me\r\nthe address of a respectable old-fashioned inn in the City, which, she said, my\r\nuncles used to frequent in former days.\r\n\n\r\nIn going to London, I ran less risk and evinced less enterprise than the reader\r\nmay think. In fact, the distance was only fifty miles. My means would suffice\r\nboth to take me there, to keep me a few days, and also to bring me back if I\r\nfound no inducement to stay. I regarded it as a brief holiday, permitted for\r\nonce to work-weary faculties, rather than as an adventure of life and death.\r\nThere is nothing like taking all you do at a moderate estimate: it keeps mind\r\nand body tranquil; whereas grandiloquent notions are apt to hurry both into\r\nfever.\r\n\n\r\nFifty miles were then a day\u2019s journey (for I speak of a time gone by: my hair,\r\nwhich, till a late period, withstood the frosts of time, lies now, at last\r\nwhite, under a white cap, like snow beneath snow). About nine o\u2019clock of a wet\r\nFebruary night I reached London.\r\n\n\r\nMy reader, I know, is one who would not thank me for an elaborate reproduction\r\nof poetic first impressions; and it is well, inasmuch as I had neither time nor\r\nmood to cherish such; arriving as I did late, on a dark, raw, and rainy\r\nevening, in a Babylon and a wilderness, of which the vastness and the\r\nstrangeness tried to the utmost any powers of clear thought and steady\r\nself-possession with which, in the absence of more brilliant faculties, Nature\r\nmight have gifted me.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I left the coach, the strange speech of the cabmen and others waiting\r\nround, seemed to me odd as a foreign tongue. I had never before heard the\r\nEnglish language chopped up in that way. However, I managed to understand and\r\nto be understood, so far as to get myself and trunk safely conveyed to the old\r\ninn whereof I had the address. How difficult, how oppressive, how puzzling\r\nseemed my flight! In London for the first time; at an inn for the first time;\r\ntired with travelling; confused with darkness; palsied with cold; unfurnished\r\nwith either experience or advice to tell me how to act, and yet\u2014to act obliged.\r\n\n\r\nInto the hands of common sense I confided the matter. Common sense, however,\r\nwas as chilled and bewildered as all my other faculties, and it was only under\r\nthe spur of an inexorable necessity that she spasmodically executed her trust.\r\nThus urged, she paid the porter: considering the crisis, I did not blame her\r\ntoo much that she was hugely cheated; she asked the waiter for a room; she\r\ntimorously called for the chambermaid; what is far more, she bore, without\r\nbeing wholly overcome, a highly supercilious style of demeanour from that young\r\nlady, when she appeared.\r\n\n\r\nI recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of town prettiness and\r\nsmartness. So trim her waist, her cap, her dress\u2014I wondered how they had all\r\nbeen manufactured. Her speech had an accent which in its mincing glibness\r\nseemed to rebuke mine as by authority; her spruce attire flaunted an easy scorn\r\nto my plain country garb.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d I thought, \u201cand then the scene is new, and the\r\ncircumstances; I shall gain good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMaintaining a very quiet manner towards this arrogant little maid, and\r\nsubsequently observing the same towards the parsonic-looking, black-coated,\r\nwhite-neckclothed waiter, I got civility from them ere long. I believe at first\r\nthey thought I was a servant; but in a little while they changed their minds,\r\nand hovered in a doubtful state between patronage and politeness.\r\n\n\r\nI kept up well till I had partaken of some refreshment, warmed myself by a\r\nfire, and was fairly shut into my own room; but, as I sat down by the bed and\r\nrested my head and arms on the pillow, a terrible oppression overcame me. All\r\nat once my position rose on me like a ghost. Anomalous, desolate, almost blank\r\nof hope it stood. What was I doing here alone in great London? What should I do\r\non the morrow? What prospects had I in life? What friends had I on earth?\r\nWhence did I come? Whither should I go? What should I do?\r\n\n\r\nI wet the pillow, my arms, and my hair, with rushing tears. A dark interval of\r\nmost bitter thought followed this burst; but I did not regret the step taken,\r\nnor wish to retract it. A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go\r\nforward than backward, and that I could go forward\u2014that a way, however\r\nnarrow and difficult, would in time open\u2014predominated over other feelings: its\r\ninfluence hushed them so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be\r\nable to say my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and\r\nlain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I\r\nknew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal hum\r\nand trembling knell, I said: \u201cI lie in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"7": "\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nLONDON.\n\r\nThe next day was the first of March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened my\r\ncurtain, I saw the risen sun struggling through fog. Above my head, above the\r\nhouse-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a solemn, orbed mass, dark\r\nblue and dim\u2014THE DOME. While I looked, my inner self moved; my spirit shook its\r\nalways-fettered wings half loose; I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet\r\ntruly lived, were at last about to taste life. In that morning my soul grew as\r\nfast as Jonah\u2019s gourd.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did well to come,\u201d I said, proceeding to dress with speed and care. \u201cI like\r\nthe spirit of this great London which I feel around me. Who but a coward would\r\npass his whole life in hamlets; and for ever abandon his faculties to the\r\neating rust of obscurity?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBeing dressed, I went down; not travel-worn and exhausted, but tidy and\r\nrefreshed. When the waiter came in with my breakfast, I managed to accost him\r\nsedately, yet cheerfully; we had ten minutes\u2019 discourse, in the course of which\r\nwe became usefully known to each other.\r\n\n\r\nHe was a grey-haired, elderly man; and, it seemed, had lived in his present\r\nplace twenty years. Having ascertained this, I was sure he must remember my two\r\nuncles, Charles and Wilmot, who, fifteen, years ago, were frequent visitors\r\nhere. I mentioned their names; he recalled them perfectly, and with respect.\r\nHaving intimated my connection, my position in his eyes was henceforth clear,\r\nand on a right footing. He said I was like my uncle Charles: I suppose he spoke\r\ntruth, because Mrs. Barrett was accustomed to say the same thing. A ready and\r\nobliging courtesy now replaced his former uncomfortably doubtful manner;\r\nhenceforth I need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a sensible\r\nquestion.\r\n\n\r\nThe street on which my little sitting-room window looked was narrow, perfectly\r\nquiet, and not dirty: the few passengers were just such as one sees in\r\nprovincial towns: here was nothing formidable; I felt sure I might venture out\r\nalone.\r\n\n\r\nHaving breakfasted, out I went. Elation and pleasure were in my heart: to walk\r\nalone in London seemed of itself an adventure. Presently I found myself in\r\nPaternoster Row\u2014classic ground this. I entered a bookseller\u2019s shop, kept by one\r\nJones: I bought a little book\u2014a piece of extravagance I could ill afford; but I\r\nthought I would one day give or send it to Mrs. Barrett. Mr. Jones, a dried-in\r\nman of business, stood behind his desk: he seemed one of the greatest, and I\r\none of the happiest of beings.\r\n\n\r\nProdigious was the amount of life I lived that morning. Finding myself before\r\nSt. Paul\u2019s, I went in; I mounted to the dome: I saw thence London, with its\r\nriver, and its bridges, and its churches; I saw antique Westminster, and the\r\ngreen Temple Gardens, with sun upon them, and a glad, blue sky, of early spring\r\nabove; and between them and it, not too dense, a cloud of haze.\r\n\n\r\nDescending, I went wandering whither chance might lead, in a still ecstasy of\r\nfreedom and enjoyment; and I got\u2014I know not how\u2014I got into the heart of city\r\nlife. I saw and felt London at last: I got into the Strand; I went up Cornhill;\r\nI mixed with the life passing along; I dared the perils of crossings. To do\r\nthis, and to do it utterly alone, gave me, perhaps an irrational, but a real\r\npleasure. Since those days, I have seen the West End, the parks, the fine\r\nsquares; but I love the city far better. The city seems so much more in\r\nearnest: its business, its rush, its roar, are such serious things, sights, and\r\nsounds. The city is getting its living\u2014the West End but enjoying its pleasure.\r\nAt the West End you may be amused, but in the city you are deeply excited.\r\n\n\r\nFaint, at last, and hungry (it was years since I had felt such healthy hunger),\r\nI returned, about two o\u2019clock, to my dark, old, and quiet inn. I dined on two\r\ndishes\u2014a plain joint and vegetables; both seemed excellent: how much better\r\nthan the small, dainty messes Miss Marchmont\u2019s cook used to send up to my kind,\r\ndead mistress and me, and to the discussion of which we could not bring half an\r\nappetite between us! Delightfully tired, I lay down, on three chairs for an\r\nhour (the room did not boast a sofa). I slept, then I woke and thought for two\r\nhours.\r\n\n\r\nMy state of mind, and all accompanying circumstances, were just now such as\r\nmost to favour the adoption of a new, resolute, and daring\u2014perhaps\r\ndesperate\u2014line of action. I had nothing to lose. Unutterable loathing of a\r\ndesolate existence past, forbade return. If I failed in what I now designed to\r\nundertake, who, save myself, would suffer? If I died far away from\u2014home, I was\r\ngoing to say, but I had no home\u2014from England, then, who would weep?\r\n\n\r\nI might suffer; I was inured to suffering: death itself had not, I thought,\r\nthose terrors for me which it has for the softly reared. I had, ere this,\r\nlooked on the thought of death with a quiet eye. Prepared, then, for any\r\nconsequences, I formed a project.\r\n\n\r\nThat same evening I obtained from my friend, the waiter, information\r\nrespecting, the sailing of vessels for a certain continental port, Boue-Marine.\r\nNo time, I found, was to be lost: that very night I must take my berth. I\r\nmight, indeed, have waited till the morning before going on board, but would\r\nnot run the risk of being too late.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter take your berth at once, ma\u2019am,\u201d counselled the waiter. I agreed with\r\nhim, and having discharged my bill, and acknowledged my friend\u2019s services at a\r\nrate which I now know was princely, and which in his eyes must have seemed\r\nabsurd\u2014and indeed, while pocketing the cash, he smiled a faint smile which\r\nintimated his opinion of the donor\u2019s savoir-faire\u2014he proceeded to call a\r\ncoach. To the driver he also recommended me, giving at the same time an\r\ninjunction about taking me, I think, to the wharf, and not leaving me to the\r\nwatermen; which that functionary promised to observe, but failed in keeping his\r\npromise: on the contrary, he offered me up as an oblation, served me as a\r\ndripping roast, making me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen.\r\n\n\r\nThis was an uncomfortable crisis. It was a dark night. The coachman instantly\r\ndrove off as soon as he had got his fare: the watermen commenced a struggle for\r\nme and my trunk. Their oaths I hear at this moment: they shook my philosophy\r\nmore than did the night, or the isolation, or the strangeness of the scene. One\r\nlaid hands on my trunk. I looked on and waited quietly; but when another laid\r\nhands on me, I spoke up, shook off his touch, stepped at once into a boat,\r\ndesired austerely that the trunk should be placed beside me\u2014\u201cJust there,\u201d\u2014which\r\nwas instantly done; for the owner of the boat I had chosen became now an ally:\r\nI was rowed off.\r\n\n\r\nBlack was the river as a torrent of ink; lights glanced on it from the piles of\r\nbuilding round, ships rocked on its bosom. They rowed me up to several vessels;\r\nI read by lantern-light their names painted in great white letters on a dark\r\nground. \u201cThe Ocean,\u201d \u201cThe Phoenix,\u201d \u201cThe Consort,\u201d \u201cThe Dolphin,\u201d were passed\r\nin turns; but \u201cThe Vivid\u201d was my ship, and it seemed she lay further down.\r\n\n\r\nDown the sable flood we glided, I thought of the Styx, and of Charon rowing\r\nsome solitary soul to the Land of Shades. Amidst the strange scene, with a\r\nchilly wind blowing in my face and midnight clouds dropping rain above my head;\r\nwith two rude rowers for companions, whose insane oaths still tortured my ear,\r\nI asked myself if I was wretched or terrified. I was neither. Often in my life\r\nhave I been far more so under comparatively safe circumstances. \u201cHow is this?\u201d\r\nsaid I. \u201cMethinks I am animated and alert, instead of being depressed and\r\napprehensive?\u201d I could not tell how it was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTHE VIVID\u201d started out, white and glaring, from the black night at last.\u2014\u201cHere\r\nyou are!\u201d said the waterman, and instantly demanded six shillings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ask too much,\u201d I said. He drew off from the vessel and swore he would not\r\nembark me till I paid it. A young man, the steward as I found afterwards, was\r\nlooking over the ship\u2019s side; he grinned a smile in anticipation of the coming\r\ncontest; to disappoint him, I paid the money. Three times that afternoon I had\r\ngiven crowns where I should have given shillings; but I consoled myself with\r\nthe reflection, \u201cIt is the price of experience.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cheated you!\u201d said the steward exultingly when I got on board. I\r\nanswered phlegmatically that \u201cI knew it,\u201d and went below.\r\n\n\r\nA stout, handsome, and showy woman was in the ladies\u2019 cabin. I asked to be\r\nshown my berth; she looked hard at me, muttered something about its being\r\nunusual for passengers to come on board at that hour, and seemed disposed to be\r\nless than civil. What a face she had\u2014so comely\u2014so insolent and so selfish!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow that I am on board, I shall certainly stay here,\u201d was my answer. \u201cI will\r\ntrouble you to show me my berth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe complied, but sullenly. I took off my bonnet, arranged my things, and lay\r\ndown. Some difficulties had been passed through; a sort of victory was won: my\r\nhomeless, anchorless, unsupported mind had again leisure for a brief repose.\r\nTill the \u201cVivid\u201d arrived in harbour, no further action would be required of me;\r\nbut then\u2026. Oh! I could not look forward. Harassed, exhausted, I lay in a\r\nhalf-trance.\r\n\n\r\nThe stewardess talked all night; not to me but to the young steward, her son\r\nand her very picture. He passed in and out of the cabin continually: they\r\ndisputed, they quarrelled, they made it up again twenty times in the course of\r\nthe night. She professed to be writing a letter home\u2014she said to her father;\r\nshe read passages of it aloud, heeding me no more than a stock\u2014perhaps she\r\nbelieved me asleep. Several of these passages appeared to comprise family\r\nsecrets, and bore special reference to one \u201cCharlotte,\u201d a younger sister who,\r\nfrom the bearing of the epistle, seemed to be on the brink of perpetrating a\r\nromantic and imprudent match; loud was the protest of this elder lady against\r\nthe distasteful union. The dutiful son laughed his mother\u2019s correspondence to\r\nscorn. She defended it, and raved at him. They were a strange pair. She might\r\nbe thirty-nine or forty, and was buxom and blooming as a girl of twenty. Hard,\r\nloud, vain and vulgar, her mind and body alike seemed brazen and imperishable.\r\nI should think, from her childhood, she must have lived in public stations; and\r\nin her youth might very likely have been a barmaid.\r\n\n\r\nTowards morning her discourse ran on a new theme: \u201cthe Watsons,\u201d a certain\r\nexpected family-party of passengers, known to her, it appeared, and by her much\r\nesteemed on account of the handsome profit realized in their fees. She said,\r\n\u201cIt was as good as a little fortune to her whenever this family crossed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt dawn all were astir, and by sunrise the passengers came on board. Boisterous\r\nwas the welcome given by the stewardess to the \u201cWatsons,\u201d and great was the\r\nbustle made in their honour. They were four in number, two males and two\r\nfemales. Besides them, there was but one other passenger\u2014a young lady, whom a\r\ngentlemanly, though languid-looking man escorted. The two groups offered a\r\nmarked contrast. The Watsons were doubtless rich people, for they had the\r\nconfidence of conscious wealth in their bearing; the women\u2014youthful both of\r\nthem, and one perfectly handsome, as far as physical beauty went\u2014were dressed\r\nrichly, gaily, and absurdly out of character for the circumstances. Their\r\nbonnets with bright flowers, their velvet cloaks and silk dresses, seemed\r\nbetter suited for park or promenade than for a damp packet deck. The men were\r\nof low stature, plain, fat, and vulgar; the oldest, plainest, greasiest,\r\nbroadest, I soon found was the husband\u2014the bridegroom I suppose, for she was\r\nvery young\u2014of the beautiful girl. Deep was my amazement at this discovery; and\r\ndeeper still when I perceived that, instead of being desperately wretched in\r\nsuch a union, she was gay even to giddiness. \u201cHer laughter,\u201d I reflected, \u201cmust\r\nbe the mere frenzy of despair.\u201d And even while this thought was crossing my\r\nmind, as I stood leaning quiet and solitary against the ship\u2019s side, she came\r\ntripping up to me, an utter stranger, with a camp-stool in her hand, and\r\nsmiling a smile of which the levity puzzled and startled me, though it showed a\r\nperfect set of perfect teeth, she offered me the accommodation of this piece of\r\nfurniture. I declined it of course, with all the courtesy I could put into my\r\nmanner; she danced off heedless and lightsome. She must have been good-natured;\r\nbut what had made her marry that individual, who was at least as much like an\r\noil-barrel as a man?\r\n\n\r\nThe other lady passenger, with the gentleman-companion, was quite a girl,\r\npretty and fair: her simple print dress, untrimmed straw-bonnet and large\r\nshawl, gracefully worn, formed a costume plain to quakerism: yet, for her,\r\nbecoming enough. Before the gentleman quitted her, I observed him throwing a\r\nglance of scrutiny over all the passengers, as if to ascertain in what company\r\nhis charge would be left. With a most dissatisfied air did his eye turn from\r\nthe ladies with the gay flowers; he looked at me, and then he spoke to his\r\ndaughter, niece, or whatever she was: she also glanced in my direction, and\r\nslightly curled her short, pretty lip. It might be myself, or it might be my\r\nhomely mourning habit, that elicited this mark of contempt; more likely, both.\r\nA bell rang; her father (I afterwards knew that it was her father) kissed her,\r\nand returned to land. The packet sailed.\r\n\n\r\nForeigners say that it is only English girls who can thus be trusted to travel\r\nalone, and deep is their wonder at the daring confidence of English parents and\r\nguardians. As for the \u201cjeunes Meess,\u201d by some their intrepidity is pronounced\r\nmasculine and \u201cinconvenant,\u201d others regard them as the passive victims of an\r\neducational and theological system which wantonly dispenses with proper\r\n\u201csurveillance.\u201d Whether this particular young lady was of the sort that can the\r\nmost safely be left unwatched, I do not know: or, rather did not then\r\nknow; but it soon appeared that the dignity of solitude was not to her taste.\r\nShe paced the deck once or twice backwards and forwards; she looked with a\r\nlittle sour air of disdain at the flaunting silks and velvets, and the bears\r\nwhich thereon danced attendance, and eventually she approached me and spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you fond of a sea-voyage?\u201d was her question.\r\n\n\r\nI explained that my fondness for a sea-voyage had yet to undergo the\r\ntest of experience; I had never made one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, how charming!\u201d cried she. \u201cI quite envy you the novelty: first\r\nimpressions, you know, are so pleasant. Now I have made so many, I quite forget\r\nthe first: I am quite blas\u00e9e about the sea and all that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help smiling.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you laugh at me?\u201d she inquired, with a frank testiness that pleased me\r\nbetter than her other talk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are so young to be blas\u00e9e about anything.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am seventeen\u201d (a little piqued).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou hardly look sixteen. Do you like travelling alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! I care nothing about it. I have crossed the Channel ten times, alone; but\r\nthen I take care never to be long alone: I always make friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will scarcely make many friends this voyage, I think\u201d (glancing at the\r\nWatson-group, who were now laughing and making a great deal of noise on deck).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot of those odious men and women,\u201d said she: \u201csuch people should be steerage\r\npassengers. Are you going to school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not the least idea\u2014beyond, at least, the port of Boue-Marine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stared, then carelessly ran on:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am going to school. Oh, the number of foreign schools I have been at in my\r\nlife! And yet I am quite an ignoramus. I know nothing\u2014nothing in the world\u2014I\r\nassure you; except that I play and dance beautifully,\u2014and French and German of\r\ncourse I know, to speak; but I can\u2019t read or write them very well. Do you know\r\nthey wanted me to translate a page of an easy German book into English the\r\nother day, and I couldn\u2019t do it. Papa was so mortified: he says it looks as if\r\nM. de Bassompierre\u2014my godpapa, who pays all my school-bills\u2014had thrown away all\r\nhis money. And then, in matters of information\u2014in history, geography,\r\narithmetic, and so on, I am quite a baby; and I write English so badly\u2014such\r\nspelling and grammar, they tell me. Into the bargain I have quite forgotten my\r\nreligion; they call me a Protestant, you know, but really I am not sure whether\r\nI am one or not: I don\u2019t well know the difference between Romanism and\r\nProtestantism. However, I don\u2019t in the least care for that. I was a Lutheran\r\nonce at Bonn\u2014dear Bonn!\u2014charming Bonn!\u2014where there were so many handsome\r\nstudents. Every nice girl in our school had an admirer; they knew our hours for\r\nwalking out, and almost always passed us on the promenade: \u2018Sch\u00f6nes M\u00e4dchen,\u2019\r\nwe used to hear them say. I was excessively happy at Bonn!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where are you now?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! at\u2014chose,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\nNow, Miss Ginevra Fanshawe (such was this young person\u2019s name) only substituted\r\nthis word \u201cchose\u201d in temporary oblivion of the real name. It was a habit\r\nshe had: \u201cchose\u201d came in at every turn in her conversation\u2014the\r\nconvenient substitute for any missing word in any language she might chance at\r\nthe time to be speaking. French girls often do the like; from them she had\r\ncaught the custom. \u201cChose,\u201d however, I found in this instance, stood for\r\nVillette\u2014the great capital of the great kingdom of Labassecour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like Villette?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty well. The natives, you know, are intensely stupid and vulgar; but there\r\nare some nice English families.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you in a school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good one?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! horrid: but I go out every Sunday, and care nothing about the\r\nma\u00eetresses or the professeurs, or the \u00e9l\u00e8ves, and send\r\nlessons au diable (one daren\u2019t say that in English, you know, but it\r\nsounds quite right in French); and thus I get on charmingly\u2026. You are laughing\r\nat me again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I am only smiling at my own thoughts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d (Without waiting for an answer)\u2014\u201cNow, do tell me where\r\nyou are going.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere Fate may lead me. My business is to earn a living where I can find it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo earn!\u201d (in consternation) \u201care you poor, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs poor as Job.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cBah! how unpleasant! But I know what it is to be poor:\r\nthey are poor enough at home\u2014papa and mamma, and all of them. Papa is called\r\nCaptain Fanshawe; he is an officer on half-pay, but well-descended, and some of\r\nour connections are great enough; but my uncle and godpapa De Bassompierre, who\r\nlives in France, is the only one that helps us: he educates us girls. I have\r\nfive sisters and three brothers. By-and-by we are to marry\u2014rather elderly\r\ngentlemen, I suppose, with cash: papa and mamma manage that. My sister Augusta\r\nis married now to a man much older-looking than papa. Augusta is very\r\nbeautiful\u2014not in my style\u2014but dark; her husband, Mr. Davies, had the yellow\r\nfever in India, and he is still the colour of a guinea; but then he is rich,\r\nand Augusta has her carriage and establishment, and we all think she has done\r\nperfectly well. Now, this is better than \u2018earning a living,\u2019 as you say. By the\r\nway, are you clever?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou can play, sing, speak three or four languages?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill I think you are clever\u201d (a pause and a yawn).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall you be sea-sick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, immensely! as soon as ever we get in sight of the sea: I begin, indeed, to\r\nfeel it already. I shall go below; and won\u2019t I order about that fat odious\r\nstewardess! Heureusement je sais faire aller mon monde.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDown she went.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not long before the other passengers followed her: throughout the\r\nafternoon I remained on deck alone. When I recall the tranquil, and even happy\r\nmood in which I passed those hours, and remember, at the same time, the\r\nposition in which I was placed; its hazardous\u2014some would have said its\r\nhopeless\u2014character; I feel that, as\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStone walls do not a prison make,\r\nNor iron bars\u2014a cage,\u201d\r\n\n\r\nso peril, loneliness, an uncertain future, are not oppressive evils, so long as\r\nthe frame is healthy and the faculties are employed; so long, especially, as\r\nLiberty lends us her wings, and Hope guides us by her star.\r\n\n\r\nI was not sick till long after we passed Margate, and deep was the pleasure I\r\ndrank in with the sea-breeze; divine the delight I drew from the heaving\r\nChannel waves, from the sea-birds on their ridges, from the white sails on\r\ntheir dark distance, from the quiet yet beclouded sky, overhanging all. In my\r\nreverie, methought I saw the continent of Europe, like a wide dream-land, far\r\naway. Sunshine lay on it, making the long coast one line of gold; tiniest\r\ntracery of clustered town and snow-gleaming tower, of woods deep massed, of\r\nheights serrated, of smooth pasturage and veiny stream, embossed the\r\nmetal-bright prospect. For background, spread a sky, solemn and dark blue,\r\nand\u2014grand with imperial promise, soft with tints of enchantment\u2014strode from\r\nnorth to south a God-bent bow, an arch of hope.\r\n\n\r\nCancel the whole of that, if you please, reader\u2014or rather let it stand, and\r\ndraw thence a moral\u2014an alliterative, text-hand copy\u2014\r\n\n\r\nDay-dreams are delusions of the demon.\r\n\n\r\nBecoming excessively sick, I faltered down into the cabin.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Fanshawe\u2019s berth chanced to be next mine; and, I am sorry to say, she\r\ntormented me with an unsparing selfishness during the whole time of our mutual\r\ndistress. Nothing could exceed her impatience and fretfulness. The Watsons, who\r\nwere very sick too, and on whom the stewardess attended with shameless\r\npartiality, were stoics compared with her. Many a time since have I noticed, in\r\npersons of Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s light, careless temperament, and fair, fragile\r\nstyle of beauty, an entire incapacity to endure: they seem to sour in\r\nadversity, like small beer in thunder. The man who takes such a woman for his\r\nwife, ought to be prepared to guarantee her an existence all sunshine.\r\nIndignant at last with her teasing peevishness, I curtly requested her \u201cto hold\r\nher tongue.\u201d The rebuff did her good, and it was observable that she liked me\r\nno worse for it.\r\n\n\r\nAs dark night drew on, the sea roughened: larger waves swayed strong against\r\nthe vessel\u2019s side. It was strange to reflect that blackness and water were\r\nround us, and to feel the ship ploughing straight on her pathless way, despite\r\nnoise, billow, and rising gale. Articles of furniture began to fall about, and\r\nit became needful to lash them to their places; the passengers grew sicker than\r\never; Miss Fanshawe declared, with groans, that she must die.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot just yet, honey,\u201d said the stewardess. \u201cWe\u2019re just in port.\u201d Accordingly,\r\nin another quarter of an hour, a calm fell upon us all; and about midnight the\r\nvoyage ended.\r\n\n\r\nI was sorry: yes, I was sorry. My resting-time was past; my difficulties\u2014my\r\nstringent difficulties\u2014recommenced. When I went on deck, the cold air and black\r\nscowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for my presumption in being where I was:\r\nthe lights of the foreign sea-port town, glimmering round the foreign harbour,\r\nmet me like unnumbered threatening eyes. Friends came on board to welcome the\r\nWatsons; a whole family of friends surrounded and bore away Miss Fanshawe;\r\nI\u2014but I dared not for one moment dwell on a comparison of positions.\r\n\n\r\nYet where should I go? I must go somewhere. Necessity dare not be nice. As I\r\ngave the stewardess her fee\u2014and she seemed surprised at receiving a coin of\r\nmore value than, from such a quarter, her coarse calculations had probably\r\nreckoned on\u2014I said, \u201cBe kind enough to direct me to some quiet, respectable\r\ninn, where I can go for the night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe not only gave me the required direction, but called a commissionaire, and\r\nbid him take charge of me, and\u2014not my trunk, for that was gone to the\r\ncustom-house.\r\n\n\r\nI followed this man along a rudely-paved street, lit now by a fitful gleam of\r\nmoonlight; he brought me to the inn. I offered him sixpence, which he refused\r\nto take; supposing it not enough, I changed it for a shilling; but this also he\r\ndeclined, speaking rather sharply, in a language to me unknown. A waiter,\r\ncoming forward into the lamp-lit inn-passage, reminded me, in broken English,\r\nthat my money was foreign money, not current here. I gave him a sovereign to\r\nchange. This little matter settled, I asked for a bedroom; supper I could not\r\ntake: I was still sea-sick and unnerved, and trembling all over. How deeply\r\nglad I was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my\r\nexhaustion. Again I might rest: though the cloud of doubt would be as thick\r\nto-morrow as ever; the necessity for exertion more urgent, the peril (of\r\ndestitution) nearer, the conflict (for existence) more severe.\r\n\n"}
{"8": "\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nVILLETTE.\n\r\nI awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed: physical\r\ndebility no longer enervated my judgment; my mind felt prompt and clear.\r\n\n\r\nJust as I finished dressing, a tap came to the door: I said, \u201cCome in,\u201d\r\nexpecting the chambermaid, whereas a rough man walked in and said,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGif me your keys, Meess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGif!\u201d said he impatiently; and as he half-snatched them from my hand, he\r\nadded, \u201cAll right! haf your tronc soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFortunately it did turn out all right: he was from the custom-house. Where to\r\ngo to get some breakfast I could not tell; but I proceeded, not without\r\nhesitation, to descend.\r\n\n\r\nI now observed, what I had not noticed in my extreme weariness last night, viz.\r\nthat this inn was, in fact, a large hotel; and as I slowly descended the broad\r\nstaircase, halting on each step (for I was in wonderfully little haste to get\r\ndown), I gazed at the high ceiling above me, at the painted walls around, at\r\nthe wide windows which filled the house with light, at the veined marble I trod\r\n(for the steps were all of marble, though uncarpeted and not very clean), and\r\ncontrasting all this with the dimensions of the closet assigned to me as a\r\nchamber, with the extreme modesty of its appointments, I fell into a\r\nphilosophizing mood.\r\n\n\r\nMuch I marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters and chamber-maids in\r\nproportioning the accommodation to the guest. How could inn-servants and\r\nship-stewardesses everywhere tell at a glance that I, for instance, was an\r\nindividual of no social significance, and little burdened by cash? They\r\ndid know it evidently: I saw quite well that they all, in a moment\u2019s\r\ncalculation, estimated me at about the same fractional value. The fact seemed\r\nto me curious and pregnant: I would not disguise from myself what it indicated,\r\nyet managed to keep up my spirits pretty well under its pressure.\r\n\n\r\nHaving at last landed in a great hall, full of skylight glare, I made my way\r\nsomehow to what proved to be the coffee-room. It cannot be denied that on\r\nentering this room I trembled somewhat; felt uncertain, solitary, wretched;\r\nwished to Heaven I knew whether I was doing right or wrong; felt convinced that\r\nit was the last, but could not help myself. Acting in the spirit and with the\r\ncalm of a fatalist, I sat down at a small table, to which a waiter presently\r\nbrought me some breakfast; and I partook of that meal in a frame of mind not\r\ngreatly calculated to favour digestion. There were many other people\r\nbreakfasting at other tables in the room; I should have felt rather more happy\r\nif amongst them all I could have seen any women; however, there was not one\u2014all\r\npresent were men. But nobody seemed to think I was doing anything strange; one\r\nor two gentlemen glanced at me occasionally, but none stared obtrusively: I\r\nsuppose if there was anything eccentric in the business, they accounted for it\r\nby this word \u201cAnglaise!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBreakfast over, I must again move\u2014in what direction? \u201cGo to Villette,\u201d said an\r\ninward voice; prompted doubtless by the recollection of this slight sentence\r\nuttered carelessly and at random by Miss Fanshawe, as she bid me good-by: \u201cI\r\nwish you would come to Madame Beck\u2019s; she has some marmots whom you might look\r\nafter; she wants an English gouvernante, or was wanting one two months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWho Madame Beck was, where she lived, I knew not; I had asked, but the question\r\npassed unheard: Miss Fanshawe, hurried away by her friends, left it unanswered.\r\nI presumed Villette to be her residence\u2014to Villette I would go. The distance\r\nwas forty miles. I knew I was catching at straws; but in the wide and weltering\r\ndeep where I found myself, I would have caught at cobwebs. Having inquired\r\nabout the means of travelling to Villette, and secured a seat in the diligence,\r\nI departed on the strength of this outline\u2014this shadow of a project. Before you\r\npronounce on the rashness of the proceeding, reader, look back to the point\r\nwhence I started; consider the desert I had left, note how little I perilled:\r\nmine was the game where the player cannot lose and may win.\r\n\n\r\nOf an artistic temperament, I deny that I am; yet I must possess something of\r\nthe artist\u2019s faculty of making the most of present pleasure: that is to say,\r\nwhen it is of the kind to my taste. I enjoyed that day, though we travelled\r\nslowly, though it was cold, though it rained. Somewhat bare, flat, and treeless\r\nwas the route along which our journey lay; and slimy canals crept, like\r\nhalf-torpid green snakes, beside the road; and formal pollard willows edged\r\nlevel fields, tilled like kitchen-garden beds. The sky, too, was monotonously\r\ngray; the atmosphere was stagnant and humid; yet amidst all these deadening\r\ninfluences, my fancy budded fresh and my heart basked in sunshine. These\r\nfeelings, however, were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless\r\nconsciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment, like a tiger crouched in a\r\njungle. The breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always; his fierce\r\nheart panted close against mine; he never stirred in his lair but I felt him: I\r\nknew he waited only for sun-down to bound ravenous from his ambush.\r\n\n\r\nI had hoped we might reach Villette ere night set in, and that thus I might\r\nescape the deeper embarrassment which obscurity seems to throw round a first\r\narrival at an unknown bourne; but, what with our slow progress and long\r\nstoppages\u2014what with a thick fog and small, dense rain\u2014darkness, that might\r\nalmost be felt, had settled on the city by the time we gained its suburbs.\r\n\n\r\nI know we passed through a gate where soldiers were stationed\u2014so much I could\r\nsee by lamplight; then, having left behind us the miry Chauss\u00e9e, we rattled\r\nover a pavement of strangely rough and flinty surface. At a bureau, the\r\ndiligence stopped, and the passengers alighted. My first business was to get my\r\ntrunk; a small matter enough, but important to me. Understanding that it was\r\nbest not to be importunate or over-eager about luggage, but to wait and watch\r\nquietly the delivery of other boxes till I saw my own, and then promptly claim\r\nand secure it, I stood apart; my eye fixed on that part of the vehicle in which\r\nI had seen my little portmanteau safely stowed, and upon which piles of\r\nadditional bags and boxes were now heaped. One by one, I saw these removed,\r\nlowered, and seized on.\r\n\n\r\nI was sure mine ought to be by this time visible: it was not. I had tied on the\r\ndirection-card with a piece of green ribbon, that I might know it at a glance:\r\nnot a fringe or fragment of green was perceptible. Every package was removed;\r\nevery tin-case and brown-paper parcel; the oilcloth cover was lifted; I saw\r\nwith distinct vision that not an umbrella, cloak, cane, hat-box or band-box\r\nremained.\r\n\n\r\nAnd my portmanteau, with my few clothes and little pocket-book enclasping the\r\nremnant of my fifteen pounds, where were they?\r\n\n\r\nI ask this question now, but I could not ask it then. I could say nothing\r\nwhatever; not possessing a phrase of speaking French: and it was French,\r\nand French only, the whole world seemed now gabbling around me. What\r\nshould I do? Approaching the conductor, I just laid my hand on his arm, pointed\r\nto a trunk, thence to the diligence-roof, and tried to express a question with\r\nmy eyes. He misunderstood me, seized the trunk indicated, and was about to\r\nhoist it on the vehicle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet that alone\u2014will you?\u201d said a voice in good English; then, in correction,\r\n\u201cQu\u2019est-ce que vous fa\u00eetes donc? Cette malle est \u00e0 moi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I had heard the Fatherland accents; they rejoiced my heart; I turned:\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, appealing to the stranger, without, in my distress, noticing\r\nwhat he was like, \u201cI cannot speak French. May I entreat you to ask this man\r\nwhat he has done with my trunk?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout discriminating, for the moment, what sort of face it was to which my\r\neyes were raised and on which they were fixed, I felt in its expression\r\nhalf-surprise at my appeal and half-doubt of the wisdom of interference.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo ask him; I would do as much for you,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know whether he smiled, but he said in a gentlemanly tone\u2014that is to\r\nsay, a tone not hard nor terrifying,\u2014\u201cWhat sort of trunk was yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI described it, including in my description the green ribbon. And forthwith he\r\ntook the conductor under hand, and I felt, through all the storm of French\r\nwhich followed, that he raked him fore and aft. Presently he returned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe fellow avers he was overloaded, and confesses that he removed your trunk\r\nafter you saw it put on, and has left it behind at Boue-Marine with other\r\nparcels; he has promised, however, to forward it to-morrow; the day after,\r\ntherefore, you will find it safe at this bureau.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said I: but my heart sank.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime what should I do? Perhaps this English gentleman saw the failure of\r\ncourage in my face; he inquired kindly, \u201cHave you any friends in this city?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere was a little pause, in the course of which, as he turned more fully to\r\nthe light of a lamp above him, I saw that he was a young, distinguished, and\r\nhandsome man; he might be a lord, for anything I knew: nature had made him good\r\nenough for a prince, I thought. His face was very pleasant; he looked high but\r\nnot arrogant, manly but not overbearing. I was turning away, in the deep\r\nconsciousness of all absence of claim to look for further help from such a one\r\nas he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas all your money in your trunk?\u201d he asked, stopping me.\r\n\n\r\nHow thankful was I to be able to answer with truth\u2014\u201cNo. I have enough in my\r\npurse\u201d (for I had near twenty francs) \u201cto keep me at a quiet inn till the day\r\nafter to-morrow; but I am quite a stranger in Villette, and don\u2019t know the\r\nstreets and the inns.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can give you the address of such an inn as you want,\u201d said he; \u201cand it is\r\nnot far off: with my direction you will easily find it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe tore a leaf from his pocket-book, wrote a few words and gave it to me. I\r\ndid think him kind; and as to distrusting him, or his advice, or his\r\naddress, I should almost as soon have thought of distrusting the Bible. There\r\nwas goodness in his countenance, and honour in his bright eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour shortest way will be to follow the Boulevard and cross the park,\u201d he\r\ncontinued; \u201cbut it is too late and too dark for a woman to go through the park\r\nalone; I will step with you thus far.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe moved on, and I followed him, through the darkness and the small soaking\r\nrain. The Boulevard was all deserted, its path miry, the water dripping from\r\nits trees; the park was black as midnight. In the double gloom of trees and\r\nfog, I could not see my guide; I could only follow his tread. Not the least\r\nfear had I: I believe I would have followed that frank tread, through continual\r\nnight, to the world\u2019s end.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, when the park was traversed, \u201cyou will go along this broad\r\nstreet till you come to steps; two lamps will show you where they are: these\r\nsteps you will descend: a narrower street lies below; following that, at the\r\nbottom you will find your inn. They speak English there, so your difficulties\r\nare now pretty well over. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, sir,\u201d said I: \u201caccept my sincerest thanks.\u201d And we parted.\r\n\n\r\nThe remembrance of his countenance, which I am sure wore a light not\r\nunbenignant to the friendless\u2014the sound in my ear of his voice, which spoke a\r\nnature chivalric to the needy and feeble, as well as the youthful and fair\u2014were\r\na sort of cordial to me long after. He was a true young English gentleman.\r\n\n\r\nOn I went, hurrying fast through a magnificent street and square, with the\r\ngrandest houses round, and amidst them the huge outline of more than one\r\noverbearing pile; which might be palace or church\u2014I could not tell. Just as I\r\npassed a portico, two mustachioed men came suddenly from behind the pillars;\r\nthey were smoking cigars: their dress implied pretensions to the rank of\r\ngentlemen, but, poor things! they were very plebeian in soul. They spoke with\r\ninsolence, and, fast as I walked, they kept pace with me a long way. At last I\r\nmet a sort of patrol, and my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit; but\r\nthey had driven me beyond my reckoning: when I could collect my faculties, I no\r\nlonger knew where I was; the staircase I must long since have passed. Puzzled,\r\nout of breath, all my pulses throbbing in inevitable agitation, I knew not\r\nwhere to turn. It was terrible to think of again encountering those bearded,\r\nsneering simpletons; yet the ground must be retraced, and the steps sought out.\r\n\n\r\nI came at last to an old and worn flight, and, taking it for granted that this\r\nmust be the one indicated, I descended them. The street into which they led was\r\nindeed narrow, but it contained no inn. On I wandered. In a very quiet and\r\ncomparatively clean and well-paved street, I saw a light burning over the door\r\nof a rather large house, loftier by a story than those round it. This\r\nmight be the inn at last. I hastened on: my knees now trembled under me: I was\r\ngetting quite exhausted.\r\n\n\r\nNo inn was this. A brass-plate embellished the great porte-coch\u00e8re: \u201cPensionnat\r\nde Demoiselles\u201d was the inscription; and beneath, a name, \u201cMadame Beck.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI started. About a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a moment. Yet I\r\nplanned nothing, and considered nothing: I had not time. Providence said, \u201cStop\r\nhere; this is your inn.\u201d Fate took me in her strong hand; mastered my\r\nwill; directed my actions: I rang the door-bell.\r\n\n\r\nWhile I waited, I would not reflect. I fixedly looked at the street-stones,\r\nwhere the door-lamp shone, and counted them and noted their shapes, and the\r\nglitter of wet on their angles. I rang again. They opened at last. A bonne in a\r\nsmart cap stood before me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay I see Madame Beck?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\nI believe if I had spoken French she would not have admitted me; but, as I\r\nspoke English, she concluded I was a foreign teacher come on business connected\r\nwith the pensionnat, and, even at that late hour, she let me in, without a word\r\nof reluctance, or a moment of hesitation.\r\n\n\r\nThe next moment I sat in a cold, glittering salon, with porcelain stove, unlit,\r\nand gilded ornaments, and polished floor. A pendule on the mantel-piece struck\r\nnine o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed. How fast beat every pulse in my frame! How I\r\nturned cold and hot by turns! I sat with my eyes fixed on the door\u2014a great\r\nwhite folding-door, with gilt mouldings: I watched to see a leaf move and open.\r\nAll had been quiet: not a mouse had stirred; the white doors were closed and\r\nmotionless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou ayre Engliss?\u201d said a voice at my elbow. I almost bounded, so unexpected\r\nwas the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.\r\n\n\r\nNo ghost stood beside me, nor anything of spectral aspect; merely a motherly,\r\ndumpy little woman, in a large shawl, a wrapping-gown, and a clean, trim\r\nnightcap.\r\n\n\r\nI said I was English, and immediately, without further prelude, we fell to a\r\nmost remarkable conversation. Madame Beck (for Madame Beck it was\u2014she had\r\nentered by a little door behind me, and, being shod with the shoes of silence,\r\nI had heard neither her entrance nor approach)\u2014Madame Beck had exhausted her\r\ncommand of insular speech when she said, \u201cYou ayre Engliss,\u201d and she now\r\nproceeded to work away volubly in her own tongue. I answered in mine. She\r\npartly understood me, but as I did not at all understand her\u2014though we made\r\ntogether an awful clamour (anything like Madame\u2019s gift of utterance I had not\r\nhitherto heard or imagined)\u2014we achieved little progress. She rang, ere long,\r\nfor aid; which arrived in the shape of a \u201cma\u00eetresse,\u201d who had been partly\r\neducated in an Irish convent, and was esteemed a perfect adept in the English\r\nlanguage. A bluff little personage this ma\u00eetresse was\u2014Labassecourienne from top\r\nto toe: and how she did slaughter the speech of Albion! However, I told her a\r\nplain tale, which she translated. I told her how I had left my own country,\r\nintent on extending my knowledge, and gaining my bread; how I was ready to turn\r\nmy hand to any useful thing, provided it was not wrong or degrading; how I\r\nwould be a child\u2019s-nurse, or a lady\u2019s-maid, and would not refuse even housework\r\nadapted to my strength. Madame heard this; and, questioning her countenance, I\r\nalmost thought the tale won her ear:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIl n\u2019y a que les Anglaises pour ces sortes d\u2019entreprises,\u201d said she:\r\n\u201csont-elles donc intr\u00e9pides ces femmes l\u00e0!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe asked my name, my age; she sat and looked at me\u2014not pityingly, not with\r\ninterest: never a gleam of sympathy, or a shade of compassion, crossed her\r\ncountenance during the interview. I felt she was not one to be led an inch by\r\nher feelings: grave and considerate, she gazed, consulting her judgment and\r\nstudying my narrative. A bell rang.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 pour la pri\u00e8re du soir!\u201d said she, and rose. Through her interpreter,\r\nshe desired me to depart now, and come back on the morrow; but this did not\r\nsuit me: I could not bear to return to the perils of darkness and the street.\r\nWith energy, yet with a collected and controlled manner, I said, addressing\r\nherself personally, and not the ma\u00eetresse: \u201cBe assured, madame, that by\r\ninstantly securing my services, your interests will be served and not injured:\r\nyou will find me one who will wish to give, in her labour, a full equivalent\r\nfor her wages; and if you hire me, it will be better that I should stay here\r\nthis night: having no acquaintance in Villette, and not possessing the language\r\nof the country, how can I secure a lodging?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d said she; \u201cbut at least you can give a reference?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe inquired after my luggage: I told her when it would arrive. She mused. At\r\nthat moment a man\u2019s step was heard in the vestibule, hastily proceeding to the\r\nouter door. (I shall go on with this part of my tale as if I had understood all\r\nthat passed; for though it was then scarce intelligible to me, I heard it\r\ntranslated afterwards).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho goes out now?\u201d demanded Madame Beck, listening to the tread.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. Paul,\u201d replied the teacher. \u201cHe came this evening to give a reading to the\r\nfirst class.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe very man I should at this moment most wish to see. Call him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe teacher ran to the salon door. M. Paul was summoned. He entered: a small,\r\ndark and spare man, in spectacles.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon cousin,\u201d began Madame, \u201cI want your opinion. We know your skill in\r\nphysiognomy; use it now. Read that countenance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe little man fixed on me his spectacles: A resolute compression of the lips,\r\nand gathering of the brow, seemed to say that he meant to see through me, and\r\nthat a veil would be no veil for him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read it,\u201d he pronounced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt qu\u2019en dites vous?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais\u2014bien des choses,\u201d was the oracular answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBad or good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf each kind, without doubt,\u201d pursued the diviner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay one trust her word?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you negotiating a matter of importance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe wishes me to engage her as bonne or gouvernante; tells a tale full of\r\nintegrity, but gives no reference.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a stranger?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn Englishwoman, as one may see.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe speaks French?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a word.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe understands it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne may then speak plainly in her presence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe gazed steadily. \u201cDo you need her services?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could do with them. You know I am disgusted with Madame Svini.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill he scrutinized. The judgment, when it at last came, was as indefinite as\r\nwhat had gone before it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEngage her. If good predominates in that nature, the action will bring its own\r\nreward; if evil\u2014eh bien! ma cousine, ce sera toujours une bonne \u0153uvre.\u201d And\r\nwith a bow and a \u201cbon soir,\u201d this vague arbiter of my destiny vanished.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Madame did engage me that very night\u2014by God\u2019s blessing I was spared the\r\nnecessity of passing forth again into the lonesome, dreary, hostile street.\r\n\n"}
{"9": "\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nMADAME BECK.\n\r\nBeing delivered into the charge of the ma\u00eetresse, I was led through a long\r\nnarrow passage into a foreign kitchen, very clean but very strange. It seemed\r\nto contain no means of cooking\u2014neither fireplace nor oven; I did not understand\r\nthat the great black furnace which filled one corner, was an efficient\r\nsubstitute for these. Surely pride was not already beginning its whispers in my\r\nheart; yet I felt a sense of relief when, instead of being left in the kitchen,\r\nas I half anticipated, I was led forward to a small inner room termed a\r\n\u201ccabinet.\u201d A cook in a jacket, a short petticoat and sabots, brought my supper:\r\nto wit\u2014some meat, nature unknown, served in an odd and acid, but pleasant\r\nsauce; some chopped potatoes, made savoury with, I know not what: vinegar and\r\nsugar, I think: a tartine, or slice of bread and butter, and a baked pear.\r\nBeing hungry, I ate and was grateful.\r\n\n\r\nAfter the \u201cpri\u00e8re du soir,\u201d Madame herself came to have another look at me. She\r\ndesired me to follow her up-stairs. Through a series of the queerest little\r\ndormitories\u2014which, I heard afterwards, had once been nuns\u2019 cells: for the\r\npremises were in part of ancient date\u2014and through the oratory\u2014a long, low,\r\ngloomy room, where a crucifix hung, pale, against the wall, and two tapers kept\r\ndim vigils\u2014she conducted me to an apartment where three children were asleep in\r\nthree tiny beds. A heated stove made the air of this room oppressive; and, to\r\nmend matters, it was scented with an odour rather strong than delicate: a\r\nperfume, indeed, altogether surprising and unexpected under the circumstances,\r\nbeing like the combination of smoke with some spirituous essence\u2014a smell, in\r\nshort, of whisky.\r\n\n\r\nBeside a table, on which flared the remnant of a candle guttering to waste in\r\nthe socket, a coarse woman, heterogeneously clad in a broad striped showy silk\r\ndress, and a stuff apron, sat in a chair fast asleep. To complete the picture,\r\nand leave no doubt as to the state of matters, a bottle and an empty glass\r\nstood at the sleeping beauty\u2019s elbow.\r\n\n\r\nMadame contemplated this remarkable tableau with great calm; she neither smiled\r\nnor scowled; no impress of anger, disgust, or surprise, ruffled the equality of\r\nher grave aspect; she did not even wake the woman! Serenely pointing to a\r\nfourth bed, she intimated that it was to be mine; then, having extinguished the\r\ncandle and substituted for it a night-lamp, she glided through an inner door,\r\nwhich she left ajar\u2014the entrance to her own chamber, a large, well-furnished\r\napartment; as was discernible through the aperture.\r\n\n\r\nMy devotions that night were all thanksgiving. Strangely had I been led since\r\nmorning\u2014unexpectedly had I been provided for. Scarcely could I believe that not\r\nforty-eight hours had elapsed since I left London, under no other guardianship\r\nthan that which protects the passenger-bird\u2014with no prospect but the dubious\r\ncloud-tracery of hope.\r\n\n\r\nI was a light sleeper; in the dead of night I suddenly awoke. All was hushed,\r\nbut a white figure stood in the room\u2014Madame in her night-dress. Moving without\r\nperceptible sound, she visited the three children in the three beds; she\r\napproached me: I feigned sleep, and she studied me long. A small pantomime\r\nensued, curious enough. I daresay she sat a quarter of an hour on the edge of\r\nmy bed, gazing at my face. She then drew nearer, bent close over me; slightly\r\nraised my cap, and turned back the border so as to expose my hair; she looked\r\nat my hand lying on the bedclothes. This done, she turned to the chair where my\r\nclothes lay: it was at the foot of the bed. Hearing her touch and lift them, I\r\nopened my eyes with precaution, for I own I felt curious to see how far her\r\ntaste for research would lead her. It led her a good way: every article did she\r\ninspect. I divined her motive for this proceeding, viz. the wish to form from\r\nthe garments a judgment respecting the wearer, her station, means, neatness,\r\n&c. The end was not bad, but the means were hardly fair or justifiable. In\r\nmy dress was a pocket; she fairly turned it inside out: she counted the money\r\nin my purse; she opened a little memorandum-book, coolly perused its contents,\r\nand took from between the leaves a small plaited lock of Miss Marchmont\u2019s grey\r\nhair. To a bunch of three keys, being those of my trunk, desk, and work-box,\r\nshe accorded special attention: with these, indeed, she withdrew a moment to\r\nher own room. I softly rose in my bed and followed her with my eye: these keys,\r\nreader, were not brought back till they had left on the toilet of the adjoining\r\nroom the impress of their wards in wax. All being thus done decently and in\r\norder, my property was returned to its place, my clothes were carefully\r\nrefolded. Of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this scrutiny? Were\r\nthey favourable or otherwise? Vain question. Madame\u2019s face of stone (for of\r\nstone in its present night aspect it looked: it had been human, and, as I said\r\nbefore, motherly, in the salon) betrayed no response.\r\n\n\r\nHer duty done\u2014I felt that in her eyes this business was a duty\u2014she rose,\r\nnoiseless as a shadow: she moved towards her own chamber; at the door, she\r\nturned, fixing her eye on the heroine of the bottle, who still slept and loudly\r\nsnored. Mrs. Svini (I presume this was Mrs. Svini, Anglic\u00e9 or Hibernic\u00e9,\r\nSweeny)\u2014Mrs. Sweeny\u2019s doom was in Madame Beck\u2019s eye\u2014an immutable purpose that\r\neye spoke: Madame\u2019s visitations for shortcomings might be slow, but they were\r\nsure. All this was very un-English: truly I was in a foreign land.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow made me further acquainted with Mrs. Sweeny. It seems she had\r\nintroduced herself to her present employer as an English lady in reduced\r\ncircumstances: a native, indeed, of Middlesex, professing to speak the English\r\ntongue with the purest metropolitan accent. Madame\u2014reliant on her own\r\ninfallible expedients for finding out the truth in time\u2014had a singular\r\nintrepidity in hiring service off-hand (as indeed seemed abundantly proved in\r\nmy own case). She received Mrs. Sweeny as nursery-governess to her three\r\nchildren. I need hardly explain to the reader that this lady was in effect a\r\nnative of Ireland; her station I do not pretend to fix: she boldly declared\r\nthat she had \u201chad the bringing-up of the son and daughter of a marquis.\u201d I\r\nthink myself, she might possibly have been a hanger-on, nurse, fosterer, or\r\nwasherwoman, in some Irish family: she spoke a smothered tongue, curiously\r\noverlaid with mincing cockney inflections. By some means or other she had\r\nacquired, and now held in possession, a wardrobe of rather suspicious\r\nsplendour\u2014gowns of stiff and costly silk, fitting her indifferently, and\r\napparently made for other proportions than those they now adorned; caps with\r\nreal lace borders, and\u2014the chief item in the inventory, the spell by which she\r\nstruck a certain awe through the household, quelling the otherwise scornfully\r\ndisposed teachers and servants, and, so long as her broad shoulders wore\r\nthe folds of that majestic drapery, even influencing Madame herself\u2014a real\r\nIndian shawl\u2014\u201cun v\u00e9ritable cachemire,\u201d as Madame Beck said, with unmixed\r\nreverence and amaze. I feel quite sure that without this \u201ccachemire\u201d she would\r\nnot have kept her footing in the pensionnat for two days: by virtue of it, and\r\nit only, she maintained the same a month.\r\n\n\r\nBut when Mrs. Sweeny knew that I was come to fill her shoes, then it was that\r\nshe declared herself\u2014then did she rise on Madame Beck in her full power\u2014then\r\ncome down on me with her concentrated weight. Madame bore this revelation and\r\nvisitation so well, so stoically, that I for very shame could not support it\r\notherwise than with composure. For one little moment Madame Beck absented\r\nherself from the room; ten minutes after, an agent of the police stood in the\r\nmidst of us. Mrs. Sweeny and her effects were removed. Madame\u2019s brow had not\r\nbeen ruffled during the scene\u2014her lips had not dropped one sharply-accented\r\nword.\r\n\n\r\nThis brisk little affair of the dismissal was all settled before breakfast:\r\norder to march given, policeman called, mutineer expelled; \u201cchambre d\u2019enfans\u201d\r\nfumigated and cleansed, windows thrown open, and every trace of the\r\naccomplished Mrs. Sweeny\u2014even to the fine essence and spiritual fragrance which\r\ngave token so subtle and so fatal of the head and front of her offending\u2014was\r\nannihilated from the Rue Fossette: all this, I say, was done between the moment\r\nof Madame Beck\u2019s issuing like Aurora from her chamber, and that in which she\r\ncoolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.\r\n\n\r\nAbout noon, I was summoned to dress Madame. (It appeared my place was to be a\r\nhybrid between gouvernante and lady\u2019s-maid.) Till noon, she haunted the house\r\nin her wrapping-gown, shawl, and soundless slippers. How would the lady-chief\r\nof an English school approve this custom?\r\n\n\r\nThe dressing of her hair puzzled me; she had plenty of it: auburn, unmixed with\r\ngrey: though she was forty years old. Seeing my embarrassment, she said, \u201cYou\r\nhave not been a femme-de-chambre in your own country?\u201d And taking the brush\r\nfrom my hand, and setting me aside, not ungently or disrespectfully, she\r\narranged it herself. In performing other offices of the toilet, she\r\nhalf-directed, half-aided me, without the least display of temper or\r\nimpatience. N.B.\u2014That was the first and last time I was required to dress her.\r\nHenceforth, on Rosine, the portress, devolved that duty.\r\n\n\r\nWhen attired, Madame Beck appeared a personage of a figure rather short and\r\nstout, yet still graceful in its own peculiar way; that is, with the grace\r\nresulting from proportion of parts. Her complexion was fresh and sanguine, not\r\ntoo rubicund; her eye, blue and serene; her dark silk dress fitted her as a\r\nFrench sempstress alone can make a dress fit; she looked well, though a little\r\nbourgeoise; as bourgeoise, indeed, she was. I know not what of harmony pervaded\r\nher whole person; and yet her face offered contrast, too: its features were by\r\nno means such as are usually seen in conjunction with a complexion of such\r\nblended freshness and repose: their outline was stern: her forehead was high\r\nbut narrow; it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did\r\nher peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled in the heart\r\nor the softness which flows thence. Her mouth was hard: it could be a little\r\ngrim; her lips were thin. For sensibility and genius, with all their tenderness\r\nand temerity, I felt somehow that Madame would be the right sort of Minos in\r\npetticoats.\r\n\n\r\nIn the long run, I found she was something else in petticoats too. Her name was\r\nModeste Maria Beck, n\u00e9e Kint: it ought to have been Ignacia. She was a\r\ncharitable woman, and did a great deal of good. There never was a mistress\r\nwhose rule was milder. I was told that she never once remonstrated with the\r\nintolerable Mrs. Sweeny, despite her tipsiness, disorder, and general neglect;\r\nyet Mrs. Sweeny had to go the moment her departure became convenient. I was\r\ntold, too, that neither masters nor teachers were found fault with in that\r\nestablishment; yet both masters and teachers were often changed: they vanished\r\nand others filled their places, none could well explain how.\r\n\n\r\nThe establishment was both a pensionnat and an externat: the externes or\r\nday-pupils exceeded one hundred in number; the boarders were about a score.\r\nMadame must have possessed high administrative powers: she ruled all these,\r\ntogether with four teachers, eight masters, six servants, and three children,\r\nmanaging at the same time to perfection the pupils\u2019 parents and friends; and\r\nthat without apparent effort; without bustle, fatigue, fever, or any symptom of\r\nundue excitement: occupied she always was\u2014busy, rarely. It is true that Madame\r\nhad her own system for managing and regulating this mass of machinery; and a\r\nvery pretty system it was: the reader has seen a specimen of it, in that small\r\naffair of turning my pocket inside out, and reading my private memoranda.\r\n\u201cSurveillance,\u201d \u201cespionage,\u201d\u2014these were her watchwords.\r\n\n\r\nStill, Madame knew what honesty was, and liked it\u2014that is, when it did not\r\nobtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her will and interest. She had a\r\nrespect for \u201cAngleterre;\u201d and as to \u201cles Anglaises,\u201d she would have the women\r\nof no other country about her own children, if she could help it.\r\n\n\r\nOften in the evening, after she had been plotting and counter-plotting, spying\r\nand receiving the reports of spies all day, she would come up to my room\u2014a\r\ntrace of real weariness on her brow\u2014and she would sit down and listen while the\r\nchildren said their little prayers to me in English: the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and the\r\nhymn beginning \u201cGentle Jesus,\u201d these little Catholics were permitted to repeat\r\nat my knee; and, when I had put them to bed, she would talk to me (I soon\r\ngained enough French to be able to understand, and even answer her) about\r\nEngland and Englishwomen, and the reasons for what she was pleased to term\r\ntheir superior intelligence, and more real and reliable probity. Very good\r\nsense she often showed; very sound opinions she often broached: she seemed to\r\nknow that keeping girls in distrustful restraint, in blind ignorance, and under\r\na surveillance that left them no moment and no corner for retirement, was not\r\nthe best way to make them grow up honest and modest women; but she averred that\r\nruinous consequences would ensue if any other method were tried with\r\ncontinental children: they were so accustomed to restraint, that relaxation,\r\nhowever guarded, would be misunderstood and fatally presumed on. She was sick,\r\nshe would declare, of the means she had to use, but use them she must; and\r\nafter discoursing, often with dignity and delicacy, to me, she would move away\r\non her \u201csouliers de silence,\u201d and glide ghost-like through the house, watching\r\nand spying everywhere, peering through every keyhole, listening behind every\r\ndoor.\r\n\n\r\nAfter all, Madame\u2019s system was not bad\u2014let me do her justice. Nothing could be\r\nbetter than all her arrangements for the physical well-being of her scholars.\r\nNo minds were overtasked: the lessons were well distributed and made\r\nincomparably easy to the learner; there was a liberty of amusement, and a\r\nprovision for exercise which kept the girls healthy; the food was abundant and\r\ngood: neither pale nor puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette.\r\nShe never grudged a holiday; she allowed plenty of time for sleeping, dressing,\r\nwashing, eating; her method in all these matters was easy, liberal, salutary,\r\nand rational: many an austere English school-mistress would do vastly well to\r\nimitate her\u2014and I believe many would be glad to do so, if exacting English\r\nparents would let them.\r\n\n\r\nAs Madame Beck ruled by espionage, she of course had her staff of spies: she\r\nperfectly knew the quality of the tools she used, and while she would not\r\nscruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty occasion\u2014flinging this sort from her\r\nlike refuse rind, after the orange has been duly squeezed\u2014I have known her\r\nfastidious in seeking pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and\r\nrustless instrument was found, she was careful of the prize, keeping it in silk\r\nand cotton-wool. Yet, woe be to that man or woman who relied on her one inch\r\nbeyond the point where it was her interest to be trustworthy: interest was the\r\nmaster-key of Madame\u2019s nature\u2014the mainspring of her motives\u2014the alpha and omega\r\nof her life. I have seen her feelings appealed to, and I have smiled in\r\nhalf-pity, half-scorn at the appellants. None ever gained her ear through that\r\nchannel, or swayed her purpose by that means. On the contrary, to attempt to\r\ntouch her heart was the surest way to rouse her antipathy, and to make of her a\r\nsecret foe. It proved to her that she had no heart to be touched: it reminded\r\nher where she was impotent and dead. Never was the distinction between charity\r\nand mercy better exemplified than in her. While devoid of sympathy, she had a\r\nsufficiency of rational benevolence: she would give in the readiest manner to\r\npeople she had never seen\u2014rather, however, to classes than to individuals.\r\n\u201cPour les pauvres,\u201d she opened her purse freely\u2014against the poor man, as\r\na rule, she kept it closed. In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society\r\nat large she took a cheerful part; no private sorrow touched her: no force or\r\nmass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers. Not the\r\nagony in Gethsemane, not the death on Calvary, could have wrung from her eyes\r\none tear.\r\n\n\r\nI say again, Madame was a very great and a very capable woman. That school\r\noffered her for her powers too limited a sphere; she ought to have swayed a\r\nnation: she should have been the leader of a turbulent legislative assembly.\r\nNobody could have browbeaten her, none irritated her nerves, exhausted her\r\npatience, or over-reached her astuteness. In her own single person, she could\r\nhave comprised the duties of a first minister and a superintendent of police.\r\nWise, firm, faithless; secret, crafty, passionless; watchful and inscrutable;\r\nacute and insensate\u2014withal perfectly decorous\u2014what more could be desired?\r\n\n\r\nThe sensible reader will not suppose that I gained all the knowledge here\r\ncondensed for his benefit in one month, or in one half-year. No! what I saw at\r\nfirst was the thriving outside of a large and flourishing educational\r\nestablishment. Here was a great house, full of healthy, lively girls, all\r\nwell-dressed and many of them handsome, gaining knowledge by a marvellously\r\neasy method, without painful exertion or useless waste of spirits; not,\r\nperhaps, making very rapid progress in anything; taking it easy, but still\r\nalways employed, and never oppressed. Here was a corps of teachers and masters,\r\nmore stringently tasked, as all the real head-labour was to be done by them, in\r\norder to save the pupils, yet having their duties so arranged that they\r\nrelieved each other in quick succession whenever the work was severe: here, in\r\nshort, was a foreign school; of which the life, movement, and variety made it a\r\ncomplete and most charming contrast to many English institutions of the same\r\nkind.\r\n\n\r\nBehind the house was a large garden, and, in summer, the pupils almost lived\r\nout of doors amongst the rose-bushes and the fruit-trees. Under the vast and\r\nvine-draped berceau, Madame would take her seat on summer afternoons, and send\r\nfor the classes, in turns, to sit round her and sew and read. Meantime, masters\r\ncame and went, delivering short and lively lectures, rather than lessons, and\r\nthe pupils made notes of their instructions, or did not make them\u2014just\r\nas inclination prompted; secure that, in case of neglect, they could copy the\r\nnotes of their companions. Besides the regular monthly jours de sortie,\r\nthe Catholic f\u00eate-days brought a succession of holidays all the year round; and\r\nsometimes on a bright summer morning, or soft summer evening; the boarders were\r\ntaken out for a long walk into the country, regaled with gaufres and\r\nvin blanc, or new milk and pain bis, or pistolets au\r\nbeurre (rolls) and coffee. All this seemed very pleasant, and Madame\r\nappeared goodness itself; and the teachers not so bad but they might be worse;\r\nand the pupils, perhaps, a little noisy and rough, but types of health and\r\nglee.\r\n\n\r\nThus did the view appear, seen through the enchantment of distance; but there\r\ncame a time when distance was to melt for me\u2014when I was to be called down from\r\nmy watch-tower of the nursery, whence I had hitherto made my observations, and\r\nwas to be compelled into closer intercourse with this little world of the Rue\r\nFossette.\r\n\n\r\nI was one day sitting up-stairs, as usual, hearing the children their English\r\nlessons, and at the same time turning a silk dress for Madame, when she came\r\nsauntering into the room with that absorbed air and brow of hard thought she\r\nsometimes wore, and which made her look so little genial. Dropping into a seat\r\nopposite mine, she remained some minutes silent. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, the eldest girl, was\r\nreading to me some little essay of Mrs. Barbauld\u2019s, and I was making her\r\ntranslate currently from English to French as she proceeded, by way of\r\nascertaining that she comprehended what she read: Madame listened.\r\n\n\r\nPresently, without preface or prelude, she said, almost in the tone of one\r\nmaking an accusation, \u201cMeess, in England you were a governess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Madame,\u201d said I smiling, \u201cyou are mistaken.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs this your first essay at teaching\u2014this attempt with my children?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI assured her it was. Again she became silent; but looking up, as I took a pin\r\nfrom the cushion, I found myself an object of study: she held me under her eye;\r\nshe seemed turning me round in her thoughts\u2014measuring my fitness for a purpose,\r\nweighing my value in a plan. Madame had, ere this, scrutinized all I had, and I\r\nbelieve she esteemed herself cognizant of much that I was; but from that day,\r\nfor the space of about a fortnight, she tried me by new tests. She listened at\r\nthe nursery door when I was shut in with the children; she followed me at a\r\ncautious distance when I walked out with them, stealing within ear-shot\r\nwhenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient screen: a strict\r\npreliminary process having thus been observed, she made a move forward.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning, coming on me abruptly, and with the semblance of hurry, she said\r\nshe found herself placed in a little dilemma. Mr. Wilson, the English master,\r\nhad failed to come at his hour, she feared he was ill; the pupils were waiting\r\nin classe; there was no one to give a lesson; should I, for once, object to\r\ngiving a short dictation exercise, just that the pupils might not have it to\r\nsay they had missed their English lesson?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn classe, Madame?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, in classe: in the second division.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere there are sixty pupils,\u201d said I; for I knew the number, and with my\r\nusual base habit of cowardice, I shrank into my sloth like a snail into its\r\nshell, and alleged incapacity and impracticability as a pretext to escape\r\naction. If left to myself, I should infallibly have let this chance slip.\r\nInadventurous, unstirred by impulses of practical ambition, I was capable of\r\nsitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook, turning silk dresses and\r\nmaking children\u2019s frocks. Not that true contentment dignified this infatuated\r\nresignation: my work had neither charm for my taste, nor hold on my interest;\r\nbut it seemed to me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety, and relieved\r\nfrom intimate trial: the negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach\r\nto happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives\u2014the life\r\nof thought, and that of reality; and, provided the former was nourished with a\r\nsufficiency of the strange necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the\r\nlatter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work, and a roof of shelter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Madame, as I stooped more busily than ever over the cutting-out of\r\na child\u2019s pinafore, \u201cleave that work.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Fifine wants it, Madame.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFifine must want it, then, for I want you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd as Madame Beck did really want and was resolved to have me\u2014as she had long\r\nbeen dissatisfied with the English master, with his shortcomings in\r\npunctuality, and his careless method of tuition\u2014as, too, she did not\r\nlack resolution and practical activity, whether I lacked them or\r\nnot\u2014she, without more ado, made me relinquish thimble and needle; my hand was\r\ntaken into hers, and I was conducted down-stairs. When we reached the carr\u00e9, a\r\nlarge square hall between the dwelling-house and the pensionnat, she paused,\r\ndropped my hand, faced, and scrutinized me. I was flushed, and tremulous from\r\nhead to foot: tell it not in Gath, I believe I was crying. In fact, the\r\ndifficulties before me were far from being wholly imaginary; some of them were\r\nreal enough; and not the least substantial lay in my want of mastery over the\r\nmedium through which I should be obliged to teach. I had, indeed, studied\r\nFrench closely since my arrival in Villette; learning its practice by day, and\r\nits theory in every leisure moment at night, to as late an hour as the rule of\r\nthe house would allow candle-light; but I was far from yet being able to trust\r\nmy powers of correct oral expression.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00eetes donc,\u201d said Madame sternly, \u201cvous sentez vous r\u00e9ellement trop faible?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI might have said \u201cYes,\u201d and gone back to nursery obscurity, and there,\r\nperhaps, mouldered for the rest of my life; but looking up at Madame, I saw in\r\nher countenance a something that made me think twice ere I decided. At that\r\ninstant she did not wear a woman\u2019s aspect, but rather a man\u2019s. Power of a\r\nparticular kind strongly limned itself in all her traits, and that power was\r\nnot my kind of power: neither sympathy, nor congeniality, nor submission, were\r\nthe emotions it awakened. I stood\u2014not soothed, nor won, nor overwhelmed. It\r\nseemed as if a challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given, and I\r\nsuddenly felt all the dishonour of my diffidence\u2014all the pusillanimity of my\r\nslackness to aspire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you,\u201d she said, \u201cgo backward or forward?\u201d indicating with her hand,\r\nfirst, the small door of communication with the dwelling-house, and then the\r\ngreat double portals of the classes or schoolrooms.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEn avant,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d pursued she, cooling as I warmed, and continuing the hard look, from\r\nvery antipathy to which I drew strength and determination, \u201ccan you face the\r\nclasses, or are you over-excited?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe sneered slightly in saying this: nervous excitability was not much to\r\nMadame\u2019s taste.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no more excited than this stone,\u201d I said, tapping the flag with my toe:\r\n\u201cor than you,\u201d I added, returning her look.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! But let me tell you these are not quiet, decorous, English girls you are\r\ngoing to encounter. Ce sont des Labassecouriennes, rondes, franches, brusques,\r\net tant soit peu rebelles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said: \u201cI know; and I know, too, that though I have studied French hard since\r\nI came here, yet I still speak it with far too much hesitation\u2014too little\r\naccuracy to be able to command their respect I shall make blunders that will\r\nlay me open to the scorn of the most ignorant. Still I mean to give the\r\nlesson.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey always throw over timid teachers,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know that too, Madame; I have heard how they rebelled against and persecuted\r\nMiss Turner\u201d\u2014a poor friendless English teacher, whom Madame had employed, and\r\nlightly discarded; and to whose piteous history I was no stranger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est vrai,\u201d said she, coolly. \u201cMiss Turner had no more command over them than\r\na servant from the kitchen would have had. She was weak and wavering; she had\r\nneither tact nor intelligence, decision nor dignity. Miss Turner would not do\r\nfor these girls at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI made no reply, but advanced to the closed schoolroom door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not expect aid from me, or from any one,\u201d said Madame. \u201cThat would at\r\nonce set you down as incompetent for your office.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI opened the door, let her pass with courtesy, and followed her. There were\r\nthree schoolrooms, all large. That dedicated to the second division, where I\r\nwas to figure, was considerably the largest, and accommodated an assemblage\r\nmore numerous, more turbulent, and infinitely more unmanageable than the other\r\ntwo. In after days, when I knew the ground better, I used to think sometimes\r\n(if such a comparison may be permitted), that the quiet, polished, tame first\r\ndivision was to the robust, riotous, demonstrative second division, what the\r\nEnglish House of Lords is to the House of Commons.\r\n\n\r\nThe first glance informed me that many of the pupils were more than girls\u2014quite\r\nyoung women; I knew that some of them were of noble family (as nobility goes in\r\nLabassecour), and I was well convinced that not one amongst them was ignorant\r\nof my position in Madame\u2019s household. As I mounted the estr\u00e0de (a low platform,\r\nraised a step above the flooring), where stood the teacher\u2019s chair and desk, I\r\nbeheld opposite to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy\r\nweather\u2014eyes full of an insolent light, and brows hard and unblushing as\r\nmarble. The continental \u201cfemale\u201d is quite a different being to the insular\r\n\u201cfemale\u201d of the same age and class: I never saw such eyes and brows in England.\r\nMadame Beck introduced me in one cool phrase, sailed from the room, and left me\r\nalone in my glory.\r\n\n\r\nI shall never forget that first lesson, nor all the under-current of life and\r\ncharacter it opened up to me. Then first did I begin rightly to see the wide\r\ndifference that lies between the novelist\u2019s and poet\u2019s ideal \u201cjeune fille\u201d and\r\nthe said \u201cjeune fille\u201d as she really is.\r\n\n\r\nIt seems that three titled belles in the first row had sat down predetermined\r\nthat a bonne d\u2019enfants should not give them lessons in English. They\r\nknew they had succeeded in expelling obnoxious teachers before now; they knew\r\nthat Madame would at any time throw overboard a professeur or maitresse who\r\nbecame unpopular with the school\u2014that she never assisted a weak official to\r\nretain his place\u2014that if he had not strength to fight, or tact to win his way,\r\ndown he went: looking at \u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d they promised themselves an easy\r\nvictory.\r\n\n\r\nMesdemoiselles Blanche, Virginie, and Ang\u00e9lique opened the campaign by a series\r\nof titterings and whisperings; these soon swelled into murmurs and short\r\nlaughs, which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more loudly. This\r\ngrowing revolt of sixty against one, soon became oppressive enough; my command\r\nof French being so limited, and exercised under such cruel constraint.\r\n\n\r\nCould I but have spoken in my own tongue, I felt as if I might have gained a\r\nhearing; for, in the first place, though I knew I looked a poor creature, and\r\nin many respects actually was so, yet nature had given me a voice that could\r\nmake itself heard, if lifted in excitement or deepened by emotion. In the\r\nsecond place, while I had no flow, only a hesitating trickle of language, in\r\nordinary circumstances, yet\u2014under stimulus such as was now rife through the\r\nmutinous mass\u2014I could, in English, have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing\r\ntheir proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized; and then with\r\nsome sarcasm, flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders, and\r\nrelieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish followers, it seemed\r\nto me that one might possibly get command over this wild herd, and bring them\r\ninto training, at least. All I could now do was to walk up to\r\nBlanche\u2014Mademoiselle de Melcy, a young baronne\u2014the eldest, tallest, handsomest,\r\nand most vicious\u2014stand before her desk, take from under her hand her\r\nexercise-book, remount the estrade, deliberately read the composition, which I\r\nfound very stupid, and, as deliberately, and in the face of the whole school,\r\ntear the blotted page in two.\r\n\n\r\nThis action availed to draw attention and check noise. One girl alone, quite in\r\nthe background, persevered in the riot with undiminished energy. I looked at\r\nher attentively. She had a pale face, hair like night, broad strong eyebrows,\r\ndecided features, and a dark, mutinous, sinister eye: I noted that she sat\r\nclose by a little door, which door, I was well aware, opened into a small\r\ncloset where books were kept. She was standing up for the purpose of conducting\r\nher clamour with freer energies. I measured her stature and calculated her\r\nstrength. She seemed both tall and wiry; but, so the conflict were brief and\r\nthe attack unexpected, I thought I might manage her.\r\n\n\r\nAdvancing up the room, looking as cool and careless as I possibly could, in\r\nshort, ayant l\u2019air de rien, I slightly pushed the door and found it was\r\najar. In an instant, and with sharpness, I had turned on her. In another\r\ninstant she occupied the closet, the door was shut, and the key in my pocket.\r\n\n\r\nIt so happened that this girl, Dolores by name, and a Catalonian by race, was\r\nthe sort of character at once dreaded and hated by all her associates; the act\r\nof summary justice above noted proved popular: there was not one present but,\r\nin her heart, liked to see it done. They were stilled for a moment; then a\r\nsmile\u2014not a laugh\u2014passed from desk to desk: then\u2014when I had gravely and\r\ntranquilly returned to the estrade, courteously requested silence, and\r\ncommenced a dictation as if nothing at all had happened\u2014the pens travelled\r\npeacefully over the pages, and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and\r\nindustry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est bien,\u201d said Madame Beck, when I came out of class, hot and a little\r\nexhausted. \u201cCa ira.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe had been listening and peeping through a spy-hole the whole time.\r\n\n\r\nFrom that day I ceased to be nursery governess, and became English teacher.\r\nMadame raised my salary; but she got thrice the work out of me she had\r\nextracted from Mr. Wilson, at half the expense.\r\n\n"}
{"10": "\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nISIDORE.\n\r\nMy time was now well and profitably filled up. What with teaching others and\r\nstudying closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment. It was pleasant. I felt I\r\nwas getting on; not lying the stagnant prey of mould and rust, but polishing\r\nmy faculties and whetting them to a keen edge with constant use. Experience of\r\na certain kind lay before me, on no narrow scale. Villette is a cosmopolitan\r\ncity, and in this school were girls of almost every European nation, and\r\nlikewise of very varied rank in life. Equality is much practised in\r\nLabassecour; though not republican in form, it is nearly so in substance, and\r\nat the desks of Madame Beck\u2019s establishment the young countess and the young\r\nbourgeoise sat side by side. Nor could you always by outward indications decide\r\nwhich was noble and which plebeian; except that, indeed, the latter had often\r\nfranker and more courteous manners, while the former bore away the bell for a\r\ndelicately-balanced combination of insolence and deceit. In the former there\r\nwas often quick French blood mixed with the marsh-phlegm: I regret to say that\r\nthe effect of this vivacious fluid chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with\r\nwhich flattery and fiction ran from the tongue, and in a manner lighter and\r\nlivelier, but quite heartless and insincere.\r\n\n\r\nTo do all parties justice, the honest aboriginal Labassecouriennes had an\r\nhypocrisy of their own, too; but it was of a coarse order, such as could\r\ndeceive few. Whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions, they brought it\r\nout with a careless ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of\r\nconscience. Not a soul in Madame Beck\u2019s house, from the scullion to the\r\ndirectress herself, but was above being ashamed of a lie; they thought nothing\r\nof it: to invent might not be precisely a virtue, but it was the most venial of\r\nfaults. \u201cJ\u2019ai menti plusieurs fois,\u201d formed an item of every girl\u2019s and woman\u2019s\r\nmonthly confession: the priest heard unshocked, and absolved unreluctant. If\r\nthey had missed going to mass, or read a chapter of a novel, that was another\r\nthing: these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the unfailing weed.\r\n\n\r\nWhile yet but half-conscious of this state of things, and unlearned in its\r\nresults, I got on in my new sphere very well. After the first few difficult\r\nlessons, given amidst peril and on the edge of a moral volcano that rumbled\r\nunder my feet and sent sparks and hot fumes into my eyes, the eruptive spirit\r\nseemed to subside, as far as I was concerned. My mind was a good deal bent on\r\nsuccess: I could not bear the thought of being baffled by mere undisciplined\r\ndisaffection and wanton indocility, in this first attempt to get on in life.\r\nMany hours of the night I used to lie awake, thinking what plan I had best\r\nadopt to get a reliable hold on these mutineers, to bring this stiff-necked\r\ntribe under permanent influence. In the first place, I saw plainly that aid in\r\nno shape was to be expected from Madame: her righteous plan was to maintain an\r\nunbroken popularity with the pupils, at any and every cost of justice or\r\ncomfort to the teachers. For a teacher to seek her alliance in any crisis of\r\ninsubordination was equivalent to securing her own expulsion. In intercourse\r\nwith her pupils, Madame only took to herself what was pleasant, amiable, and\r\nrecommendatory; rigidly requiring of her lieutenants sufficiency for every\r\nannoying crisis, where to act with adequate promptitude was to be unpopular.\r\nThus, I must look only to myself.\r\n\n\r\nImprimis\u2014it was clear as the day that this swinish multitude were not to be\r\ndriven by force. They were to be humoured, borne with very patiently: a\r\ncourteous though sedate manner impressed them; a very rare flash of raillery\r\ndid good. Severe or continuous mental application they could not, or would not,\r\nbear: heavy demand on the memory, the reason, the attention, they rejected\r\npoint-blank. Where an English girl of not more than average capacity and\r\ndocility would quietly take a theme and bind herself to the task of\r\ncomprehension and mastery, a Labassecourienne would laugh in your face, and\r\nthrow it back to you with the phrase,\u2014\u201cDieu, que c\u2019est difficile! Je n\u2019en veux\r\npas. Cela m\u2019ennuie trop.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA teacher who understood her business would take it back at once, without\r\nhesitation, contest, or expostulation\u2014proceed with even exaggerated care to\r\nsmoothe every difficulty, to reduce it to the level of their understandings,\r\nreturn it to them thus modified, and lay on the lash of sarcasm with unsparing\r\nhand. They would feel the sting, perhaps wince a little under it; but they bore\r\nno malice against this sort of attack, provided the sneer was not sour,\r\nbut hearty, and that it held well up to them, in a clear, light, and\r\nbold type, so that she who ran might read, their incapacity, ignorance, and\r\nsloth. They would riot for three additional lines to a lesson; but I never knew\r\nthem rebel against a wound given to their self-respect: the little they had of\r\nthat quality was trained to be crushed, and it rather liked the pressure of a\r\nfirm heel than otherwise.\r\n\n\r\nBy degrees, as I acquired fluency and freedom in their language, and could make\r\nsuch application of its more nervous idioms as suited their case, the elder and\r\nmore intelligent girls began rather to like me in their way: I noticed that\r\nwhenever a pupil had been roused to feel in her soul the stirring of worthy\r\nemulation, or the quickening of honest shame, from that date she was won. If I\r\ncould but once make their (usually large) ears burn under their thick glossy\r\nhair, all was comparatively well. By-and-by bouquets began to be laid on my\r\ndesk in the morning; by way of acknowledgment for this little foreign\r\nattention, I used sometimes to walk with a select few during recreation. In the\r\ncourse of conversation it befel once or twice that I made an unpremeditated\r\nattempt to rectify some of their singularly distorted notions of principle;\r\nespecially I expressed my ideas of the evil and baseness of a lie. In an\r\nunguarded moment, I chanced to say that, of the two errors; I considered\r\nfalsehood worse than an occasional lapse in church-attendance. The poor girls\r\nwere tutored to report in Catholic ears whatever the Protestant teacher said.\r\nAn edifying consequence ensued. Something\u2014an unseen, an indefinite, a\r\nnameless\u2014something stole between myself and these my best pupils: the bouquets\r\ncontinued to be offered, but conversation thenceforth became impracticable. As\r\nI paced the alleys or sat in the berceau, a girl never came to my right hand\r\nbut a teacher, as if by magic, appeared at my left. Also, wonderful to relate,\r\nMadame\u2019s shoes of silence brought her continually to my back, as quick, as\r\nnoiseless and unexpected, as some wandering zephyr.\r\n\n\r\nThe opinion of my Catholic acquaintance concerning my spiritual prospects was\r\nsomewhat na\u00efvely expressed to me on one occasion. A pensionnaire, to whom I had\r\nrendered some little service, exclaimed one day as she sat beside me:\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, what a pity you are a Protestant!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Isabelle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cParceque, quand vous serez morte\u2014vous br\u00fblerez tout de suite dans l\u2019Enfer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCroyez-vous?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainement que j\u2019y crois: tout le monde le sait; et d\u2019ailleurs le pr\u00eatre me\r\nl\u2019a dit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIsabelle was an odd, blunt little creature. She added, sotto voce: \u201cPour\r\nassurer votre salut l\u00e0-haut, on ferait bien de vous br\u00fbler toute vive ici-bas.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed, as, indeed, it was impossible to do otherwise.\r\n\n\r\nHas the reader forgotten Miss Ginevra Fanshawe? If so, I must be allowed to\r\nre-introduce that young lady as a thriving pupil of Madame Beck\u2019s; for such she\r\nwas. On her arrival in the Rue Fossette, two or three days after my sudden\r\nsettlement there, she encountered me with very little surprise. She must have\r\nhad good blood in her veins, for never was any duchess more perfectly,\r\nradically, unaffectedly nonchalante than she: a weak, transient amaze\r\nwas all she knew of the sensation of wonder. Most of her other faculties seemed\r\nto be in the same flimsy condition: her liking and disliking, her love and\r\nhate, were mere cobweb and gossamer; but she had one thing about her that\r\nseemed strong and durable enough, and that was\u2014her selfishness.\r\n\n\r\nShe was not proud; and\u2014bonne d\u2019enfants as I was\u2014she would forthwith have\r\nmade of me a sort of friend and confidant. She teased me with a thousand vapid\r\ncomplaints about school-quarrels and household economy: the cookery was not to\r\nher taste; the people about her, teachers and pupils, she held to be\r\ndespicable, because they were foreigners. I bore with her abuse of the Friday\u2019s\r\nsalt fish and hard eggs\u2014with her invective against the soup, the bread, the\r\ncoffee\u2014with some patience for a time; but at last, wearied by iteration, I\r\nturned crusty, and put her to rights: a thing I ought to have done in the very\r\nbeginning, for a salutary setting down always agreed with her.\r\n\n\r\nMuch longer had I to endure her demands on me in the way of work. Her wardrobe,\r\nso far as concerned articles of external wear, was well and elegantly supplied;\r\nbut there were other habiliments not so carefully provided: what she had,\r\nneeded frequent repair. She hated needle-drudgery herself, and she would bring\r\nher hose, &c. to me in heaps, to be mended. A compliance of some weeks\r\nthreatening to result in the establishment of an intolerable bore\u2014I at last\r\ndistinctly told her she must make up her mind to mend her own garments. She\r\ncried on receiving this information, and accused me of having ceased to be her\r\nfriend; but I held by my decision, and let the hysterics pass as they could.\r\n\n\r\nNotwithstanding these foibles, and various others needless to mention\u2014but by no\r\nmeans of a refined or elevating character\u2014how pretty she was! How charming she\r\nlooked, when she came down on a sunny Sunday morning, well-dressed and\r\nwell-humoured, robed in pale lilac silk, and with her fair long curls reposing\r\non her white shoulders. Sunday was a holiday which she always passed with\r\nfriends resident in town; and amongst these friends she speedily gave me to\r\nunderstand was one who would fain become something more. By glimpses and hints\r\nit was shown me, and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was ere\r\nlong proved, that ardent admiration\u2014perhaps genuine love\u2014was at her command.\r\nShe called her suitor \u201cIsidore:\u201d this, however, she intimated was not his real\r\nname, but one by which it pleased her to baptize him\u2014his own, she hinted, not\r\nbeing \u201cvery pretty.\u201d Once, when she had been bragging about the vehemence of\r\n\u201cIsidore\u2019s\u201d attachment, I asked if she loved him in return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComme cela,\u201d said she: \u201che is handsome, and he loves me to distraction, so\r\nthat I am well amused. Ca suffit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFinding that she carried the thing on longer than, from her very fickle tastes,\r\nI had anticipated, I one day took it upon me to make serious inquiries as to\r\nwhether the gentleman was such as her parents, and especially her uncle\u2014on\r\nwhom, it appeared, she was dependent\u2014would be likely to approve. She allowed\r\nthat this was very doubtful, as she did not believe \u201cIsidore\u201d had much money.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you encourage him?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFurieusement sometimes,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWithout being certain that you will be permitted to marry him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, how dowdyish you are! I don\u2019t want to be married. I am too young.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if he loves you as much as you say, and yet it comes to nothing in the\r\nend, he will be made miserable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf course he will break his heart. I should be shocked and, disappointed if he\r\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder whether this M. Isidore is a fool?\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is, about me; but he is wise in other things, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on dit. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley considers him extremely clever: she says he will push his way by\r\nhis talents; all I know is, that he does little more than sigh in my presence,\r\nand that I can wind him round my little finger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWishing to get a more definite idea of this love-stricken M. Isidore; whose\r\nposition seemed to me of the least secure, I requested her to favour me with a\r\npersonal description; but she could not describe: she had neither words nor the\r\npower of putting them together so as to make graphic phrases. She even seemed\r\nnot properly to have noticed him: nothing of his looks, of the changes in his\r\ncountenance, had touched her heart or dwelt in her memory\u2014that he was \u201cbeau,\r\nmais plut\u00f4t bel homme que joli gar\u00e7on,\u201d was all she could assert. My patience\r\nwould often have failed, and my interest flagged, in listening to her, but for\r\none thing. All the hints she dropped, all the details she gave, went\r\nunconsciously to prove, to my thinking, that M. Isidore\u2019s homage was offered\r\nwith great delicacy and respect. I informed her very plainly that I believed\r\nhim much too good for her, and intimated with equal plainness my impression\r\nthat she was but a vain coquette. She laughed, shook her curls from her eyes,\r\nand danced away as if I had paid her a compliment.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Ginevra\u2019s school-studies were little better than nominal; there were but\r\nthree things she practised in earnest, viz. music, singing, and dancing; also\r\nembroidering the fine cambric handkerchiefs which she could not afford to buy\r\nready worked: such mere trifles as lessons in history, geography, grammar, and\r\narithmetic, she left undone, or got others to do for her. Very much of her time\r\nwas spent in visiting. Madame, aware that her stay at school was now limited to\r\na certain period, which would not be extended whether she made progress or not,\r\nallowed her great licence in this particular. Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2014her\r\nchaperon\u2014a gay, fashionable lady, invited her whenever she had company\r\nat her own house, and sometimes took her to evening-parties at the houses of\r\nher acquaintance. Ginevra perfectly approved this mode of procedure: it had but\r\none inconvenience; she was obliged to be well dressed, and she had not money to\r\nbuy variety of dresses. All her thoughts turned on this difficulty; her whole\r\nsoul was occupied with expedients for effecting its solution. It was wonderful\r\nto witness the activity of her otherwise indolent mind on this point, and to\r\nsee the much-daring intrepidity to which she was spurred by a sense of\r\nnecessity, and the wish to shine.\r\n\n\r\nShe begged boldly of Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2014boldly, I say: not with an air of\r\nreluctant shame, but in this strain:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy darling Mrs. C., I have nothing in the world fit to wear for your party\r\nnext week; you must give me a book-muslin dress, and then a ceinture\r\nbleu celeste: do\u2014there\u2019s an angel! will you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe \u201cdarling Mrs. C.\u201d yielded at first; but finding that applications increased\r\nas they were complied with, she was soon obliged, like all Miss Fanshawe\u2019s\r\nfriends, to oppose resistance to encroachment. After a while I heard no more of\r\nMrs. Cholmondeley\u2019s presents; but still, visiting went on, and the absolutely\r\nnecessary dresses continued to be supplied: also many little expensive\r\netcetera\u2014gloves, bouquets, even trinkets. These things, contrary to her\r\ncustom, and even nature\u2014for she was not secretive\u2014were most sedulously kept out\r\nof sight for a time; but one evening, when she was going to a large party for\r\nwhich particular care and elegance of costume were demanded, she could not\r\nresist coming to my chamber to show herself in all her splendour.\r\n\n\r\nBeautiful she looked: so young, so fresh, and with a delicacy of skin and\r\nflexibility of shape altogether English, and not found in the list of\r\ncontinental female charms. Her dress was new, costly, and perfect. I saw at a\r\nglance that it lacked none of those finishing details which cost so much, and\r\ngive to the general effect such an air of tasteful completeness.\r\n\n\r\nI viewed her from top to toe. She turned airily round that I might survey her\r\non all sides. Conscious of her charms, she was in her best humour: her rather\r\nsmall blue eyes sparkled gleefully. She was going to bestow on me a kiss, in\r\nher school-girl fashion of showing her delights but I said, \u201cSteady! Let us be\r\nSteady, and know what we are about, and find out the meaning of our\r\nmagnificence\u201d\u2014and so put her off at arm\u2019s length, to undergo cooler inspection.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I do?\u201d was her question.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo?\u201d said I. \u201cThere are different ways of doing; and, by my word, I don\u2019t\r\nunderstand yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how do I look?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look well dressed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe thought the praise not warm enough, and proceeded to direct attention to\r\nthe various decorative points of her attire. \u201cLook at this parure,\u201d said\r\nshe. \u201cThe brooch, the ear-rings, the bracelets: no one in the school has such a\r\nset\u2014not Madame herself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see them all.\u201d (Pause.) \u201cDid M. de Bassompierre give you those jewels?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle knows nothing about them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere they presents from Mrs. Cholmondeley?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot they, indeed. Mrs. Cholmondeley is a mean, stingy creature; she never\r\ngives me anything now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not choose to ask any further questions, but turned abruptly away.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, old Crusty\u2014old Diogenes\u201d (these were her familiar terms for me when we\r\ndisagreed), \u201cwhat is the matter now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake yourself away. I have no pleasure in looking at you or your\r\nparure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor an instant, she seemed taken by surprise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now, Mother Wisdom? I have not got into debt for it\u2014that is, not for the\r\njewels, nor the gloves, nor the bouquet. My dress is certainly not paid for,\r\nbut uncle de Bassompierre will pay it in the bill: he never notices items, but\r\njust looks at the total; and he is so rich, one need not care about a few\r\nguineas more or less.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you go? I want to shut the door\u2026. Ginevra, people may tell you you are\r\nvery handsome in that ball-attire; but, in my eyes, you will never look\r\nso pretty as you did in the gingham gown and plain straw bonnet you wore when I\r\nfirst saw you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOther people have not your puritanical tastes,\u201d was her angry reply. \u201cAnd,\r\nbesides, I see no right you have to sermonize me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly! I have little right; and you, perhaps, have still less to come\r\nflourishing and fluttering into my chamber\u2014a mere jay in borrowed plumes. I\r\nhave not the least respect for your feathers, Miss Fanshawe; and especially the\r\npeacock\u2019s eyes you call a parure: very pretty things, if you had bought\r\nthem with money which was your own, and which you could well spare, but not at\r\nall pretty under present circumstances.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn est l\u00e0 pour Mademoiselle Fanshawe!\u201d was announced by the portress, and away\r\nshe tripped.\r\n\n\r\nThis semi-mystery of the parure was not solved till two or three days\r\nafterwards, when she came to make a voluntary confession.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need not be sulky with me,\u201d she began, \u201cin the idea that I am running\r\nsomebody, papa or M. de Bassompierre, deeply into debt. I assure you nothing\r\nremains unpaid for, but the few dresses I have lately had: all the rest is\r\nsettled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d I thought, \u201clies the mystery; considering that they were not given you\r\nby Mrs. Cholmondeley, and that your own means are limited to a few shillings,\r\nof which I know you to be excessively careful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEcoutez!\u201d she went on, drawing near and speaking in her most confidential and\r\ncoaxing tone; for my \u201csulkiness\u201d was inconvenient to her: she liked me to be in\r\na talking and listening mood, even if I only talked to chide and listened to\r\nrail. \u201cEcoutez, ch\u00e8re grogneuse! I will tell you all how and about it; and you\r\nwill then see, not only how right the whole thing is, but how cleverly managed.\r\nIn the first place, I must go out. Papa himself said that he wished me\r\nto see something of the world; he particularly remarked to Mrs. Cholmondeley,\r\nthat, though I was a sweet creature enough, I had rather a\r\nbread-and-butter-eating, school-girl air; of which it was his special desire\r\nthat I should get rid, by an introduction to society here, before I make my\r\nregular d\u00e9but in England. Well, then, if I go out, I must dress. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley is turned shabby, and will give nothing more; it would be too hard\r\nupon uncle to make him pay for all the things I need: that you\r\ncan\u2019t deny\u2014that agrees with your own preachments. Well, but SOMEBODY who\r\nheard me (quite by chance, I assure you) complaining to Mrs. Cholmondeley of my\r\ndistressed circumstances, and what straits I was put to for an ornament or\r\ntwo\u2014somebody, far from grudging one a present, was quite delighted at\r\nthe idea of being permitted to offer some trifle. You should have seen what a\r\nblanc-bec he looked when he first spoke of it: how he hesitated and\r\nblushed, and positively trembled from fear of a repulse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Miss Fanshawe. I suppose I am to understand that M. Isidore is\r\nthe benefactor: that it is from him you have accepted that costly\r\nparure; that he supplies your bouquets and your gloves?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou express yourself so disagreeably,\u201d said she, \u201cone hardly knows how to\r\nanswer; what I mean to say is, that I occasionally allow Isidore the pleasure\r\nand honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt comes to the same thing\u2026. Now, Ginevra, to speak the plain truth, I don\u2019t\r\nvery well understand these matters; but I believe you are doing very\r\nwrong\u2014seriously wrong. Perhaps, however, you now feel certain that you will be\r\nable to marry M. Isidore; your parents and uncle have given their consent, and,\r\nfor your part, you love him entirely?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais pas du tout!\u201d (she always had recourse to French when about to say\r\nsomething specially heartless and perverse). \u201cJe suis sa reine, mais il n\u2019est\r\npas mon roi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I must believe this language is mere nonsense and coquetry. There\r\nis nothing great about you, yet you are above profiting by the good nature and\r\npurse of a man to whom you feel absolute indifference. You love M. Isidore far\r\nmore than you think, or will avow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. I danced with a young officer the other night, whom I love a thousand\r\ntimes more than he. I often wonder why I feel so very cold to Isidore, for\r\neverybody says he is handsome, and other ladies admire him; but, somehow, he\r\nbores me: let me see now how it is\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she seemed to make an effort to reflect. In this I encouraged her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d I said, \u201ctry to get a clear idea of the state of your mind. To me it\r\nseems in a great mess\u2014chaotic as a rag-bag.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is something in this fashion,\u201d she cried out ere long: \u201cthe man is too\r\nromantic and devoted, and he expects something more of me than I find it\r\nconvenient to be. He thinks I am perfect: furnished with all sorts of sterling\r\nqualities and solid virtues, such as I never had, nor intend to have. Now, one\r\ncan\u2019t help, in his presence, rather trying to justify his good opinion; and it\r\ndoes so tire one to be goody, and to talk sense,\u2014for he really thinks I am\r\nsensible. I am far more at my ease with you, old lady\u2014you, you dear\r\ncrosspatch\u2014who take me at my lowest, and know me to be coquettish, and\r\nignorant, and flirting, and fickle, and silly, and selfish, and all the other\r\nsweet things you and I have agreed to be a part of my character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is all very well,\u201d I said, making a strenuous effort to preserve that\r\ngravity and severity which ran risk of being shaken by this whimsical candour,\r\n\u201cbut it does not alter that wretched business of the presents. Pack them up,\r\nGinevra, like a good, honest girl, and send them back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I won\u2019t,\u201d said she, stoutly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are deceiving M. Isidore. It stands to reason that by accepting his\r\npresents you give him to understand he will one day receive an equivalent, in\r\nyour regard\u2026\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t,\u201d she interrupted: \u201che has his equivalent now, in the pleasure of\r\nseeing me wear them\u2014quite enough for him: he is only bourgeois.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis phrase, in its senseless arrogance, quite cured me of the temporary\r\nweakness which had made me relax my tone and aspect. She rattled on:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy present business is to enjoy youth, and not to think of fettering myself,\r\nby promise or vow, to this man or that. When first I saw Isidore, I believed he\r\nwould help me to enjoy it I believed he would be content with my being a pretty\r\ngirl; and that we should meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies,\r\nand be happy. Lo, and behold! I find him at times as grave as a judge, and\r\ndeep-feeling and thoughtful. Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes profonds et\r\npassionn\u00e9s ne sont pas \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far\r\nbetter. Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons! Vive les joies et les\r\nplaisirs! A bas les grandes passions et les s\u00e9v\u00e8res vertus!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked for an answer to this tirade. I gave none.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019aime mon beau Colonel,\u201d she went on: \u201cje n\u2019aimerai jamais son rival. Je ne\r\nserai jamais femme de bourgeois, moi!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI now signified that it was imperatively necessary my apartment should be\r\nrelieved of the honour of her presence: she went away laughing.\r\n\n"}
{"11": "\nCHAPTER X.\r\nDR JOHN.\n\r\nMadame Beck was a most consistent character; forbearing with all the world, and\r\ntender to no part of it. Her own children drew her into no deviation from the\r\neven tenor of her stoic calm. She was solicitous about her family, vigilant for\r\ntheir interests and physical well-being; but she never seemed to know the wish\r\nto take her little children upon her lap, to press their rosy lips with her\r\nown, to gather them in a genial embrace, to shower on them softly the benignant\r\ncaress, the loving word.\r\n\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes sitting in the garden, viewing the little bees\r\nafar off, as they walked in a distant alley with Trinette, their bonne;\r\nin her mien spoke care and prudence. I know she often pondered anxiously what\r\nshe called \u201cleur avenir;\u201d but if the youngest, a puny and delicate but engaging\r\nchild, chancing to spy her, broke from its nurse, and toddling down the walk,\r\ncame all eager and laughing and panting to clasp her knee, Madame would just\r\ncalmly put out one hand, so as to prevent inconvenient concussion from the\r\nchild\u2019s sudden onset: \u201cPrends garde, mon enfant!\u201d she would say unmoved,\r\npatiently permit it to stand near her a few moments, and then, without smile or\r\nkiss, or endearing syllable, rise and lead it back to Trinette.\r\n\n\r\nHer demeanour to the eldest girl was equally characteristic in another way.\r\nThis was a vicious child. \u201cQuelle peste que cette D\u00e9sir\u00e9e! Quel poison que cet\r\nenfant l\u00e0!\u201d were the expressions dedicated to her, alike in kitchen and in\r\nschoolroom. Amongst her other endowments she boasted an exquisite skill in the\r\nart, of provocation, sometimes driving her bonne and the servants almost\r\nwild. She would steal to their attics, open their drawers and boxes, wantonly\r\ntear their best caps and soil their best shawls; she would watch her\r\nopportunity to get at the buffet of the salle-\u00e0-manger, where she would smash\r\narticles of porcelain or glass\u2014or to the cupboard of the storeroom, where she\r\nwould plunder the preserves, drink the sweet wine, break jars and bottles, and\r\nso contrive as to throw the onus of suspicion on the cook and the kitchen-maid.\r\nAll this when Madame saw, and of which when she received report, her sole\r\nobservation, uttered with matchless serenity, was:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00e9sir\u00e9e a besoin d\u2019une surveillance toute particuli\u00e8re.\u201d Accordingly she kept\r\nthis promising olive-branch a good deal at her side. Never once, I believe, did\r\nshe tell her faithfully of her faults, explain the evil of such habits, and\r\nshow the results which must thence ensue. Surveillance must work the whole\r\ncure. It failed of course. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e was kept in some measure from the servants,\r\nbut she teased and pillaged her mamma instead. Whatever belonging to Madame\u2019s\r\nwork-table or toilet she could lay her hands on, she stole and hid. Madame saw\r\nall this, but she still pretended not to see: she had not rectitude of soul to\r\nconfront the child with her vices. When an article disappeared whose value\r\nrendered restitution necessary, she would profess to think that D\u00e9sir\u00e9e had\r\ntaken it away in play, and beg her to restore it. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e was not to be so\r\ncheated: she had learned to bring falsehood to the aid of theft, and would deny\r\nhaving touched the brooch, ring, or scissors. Carrying on the hollow system,\r\nthe mother would calmly assume an air of belief, and afterwards ceaselessly\r\nwatch and dog the child till she tracked her: to her hiding-places\u2014some hole in\r\nthe garden-wall\u2014some chink or cranny in garret or out-house. This done, Madame\r\nwould send D\u00e9sir\u00e9e out for a walk with her bonne, and profit by her\r\nabsence to rob the robber. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e proved herself the true daughter of her\r\nastute parent, by never suffering either her countenance or manner to betray\r\nthe least sign of mortification on discovering the loss.\r\n\n\r\nThe second child, Fifine, was said to be like its dead father. Certainly,\r\nthough the mother had given it her healthy frame, her blue eye and ruddy cheek,\r\nnot from her was derived its moral being. It was an honest, gleeful little\r\nsoul: a passionate, warm-tempered, bustling creature it was too, and of the\r\nsort likely to blunder often into perils and difficulties. One day it bethought\r\nitself to fall from top to bottom of a steep flight of stone steps; and when\r\nMadame, hearing the noise (she always heard every noise), issued from the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger and picked it up, she said quietly,\u2014\u201cCet enfant a un os de\r\ncass\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt first we hoped this was not the case. It was, however, but too true: one\r\nlittle plump arm hung powerless.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet Meess\u201d (meaning me) \u201ctake her,\u201d said Madame; \u201cet qu\u2019on aille tout de suite\r\nchercher un fiacre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn a fiacre she promptly, but with admirable coolness and\r\nself-possession, departed to fetch a surgeon.\r\n\n\r\nIt appeared she did not find the family-surgeon at home; but that mattered not:\r\nshe sought until she laid her hand on a substitute to her mind, and brought him\r\nback with her. Meantime I had cut the child\u2019s sleeve from its arm, undressed\r\nand put it to bed.\r\n\n\r\nWe none of us, I suppose (by we I mean the bonne, the cook, the\r\nportress, and myself, all which personages were now gathered in the small and\r\nheated chamber), looked very scrutinizingly at the new doctor when he came into\r\nthe room. I, at least, was taken up with endeavouring to soothe Fifine; whose\r\ncries (for she had good lungs) were appalling to hear. These cries redoubled in\r\nintensity as the stranger approached her bed; when he took her up, \u201cLet alone!\u201d\r\nshe cried passionately, in her broken English (for she spoke English as did the\r\nother children). \u201cI will not you: I will Dr. Pillule!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Dr. Pillule is my very good friend,\u201d was the answer, in perfect English;\r\n\u201cbut he is busy at a place three leagues off, and I am come in his stead. So\r\nnow, when we get a little calmer, we must commence business; and we will soon\r\nhave that unlucky little arm bandaged and in right order.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHereupon he called for a glass of eau sucr\u00e9e, fed her with some\r\nteaspoonfuls of the sweet liquid (Fifine was a frank gourmande; anybody could\r\nwin her heart through her palate), promised her more when the operation should\r\nbe over, and promptly went to work. Some assistance being needed, he demanded\r\nit of the cook, a robust, strong-armed woman; but she, the portress, and the\r\nnurse instantly fled. I did not like to touch that small, tortured limb, but\r\nthinking there was no alternative, my hand was already extended to do what was\r\nrequisite. I was anticipated; Madame Beck had put out her own hand: hers was\r\nsteady while mine trembled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCa vaudra mieux,\u201d said the doctor, turning from me to her.\r\n\n\r\nHe showed wisdom in his choice. Mine would have been feigned stoicism, forced\r\nfortitude. Hers was neither forced nor feigned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerci, Madame; tr\u00e8s bien, fort bien!\u201d said the operator when he had finished.\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 un sang-froid bien opportun, et qui vaut mille \u00e9lans de sensibilit\u00e9\r\nd\u00e9plac\u00e9e.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was pleased with her firmness, she with his compliment. It was likely, too,\r\nthat his whole general appearance, his voice, mien, and manner, wrought\r\nimpressions in his favour. Indeed, when you looked well at him, and when a lamp\r\nwas brought in\u2014for it was evening and now waxing dusk\u2014you saw that, unless\r\nMadame Beck had been less than woman, it could not well be otherwise. This\r\nyoung doctor (he was young) had no common aspect. His stature looked\r\nimposingly tall in that little chamber, and amidst that group of Dutch-made\r\nwomen; his profile was clear, fine and expressive: perhaps his eye glanced from\r\nface to face rather too vividly, too quickly, and too often; but it had a most\r\npleasant character, and so had his mouth; his chin was full, cleft, Grecian,\r\nand perfect. As to his smile, one could not in a hurry make up one\u2019s mind as to\r\nthe descriptive epithet it merited; there was something in it that pleased, but\r\nsomething too that brought surging up into the mind all one\u2019s foibles and weak\r\npoints: all that could lay one open to a laugh. Yet Fifine liked this doubtful\r\nsmile, and thought the owner genial: much as he had hurt her, she held out her\r\nhand to bid him a friendly good-night. He patted the little hand kindly, and\r\nthen he and Madame went down-stairs together; she talking in her highest tide\r\nof spirits and volubility, he listening with an air of good-natured amenity,\r\ndashed with that unconscious roguish archness I find it difficult to describe.\r\n\n\r\nI noticed that though he spoke French well, he spoke English better; he had,\r\ntoo, an English complexion, eyes, and form. I noticed more. As he passed me in\r\nleaving the room, turning his face in my direction one moment\u2014not to address\r\nme, but to speak to Madame, yet so standing, that I almost necessarily looked\r\nup at him\u2014a recollection which had been struggling to form in my memory, since\r\nthe first moment I heard his voice, started up perfected. This was the very\r\ngentleman to whom I had spoken at the bureau; who had helped me in the matter\r\nof the trunk; who had been my guide through the dark, wet park. Listening, as\r\nhe passed down the long vestibule out into the street, I recognised his very\r\ntread: it was the same firm and equal stride I had followed under the dripping\r\ntrees.\r\n\n\r\nIt was to be concluded that this young surgeon-physician\u2019s first visit to the\r\nRue Fossette would be the last. The respectable Dr. Pillule being expected home\r\nthe next day, there appeared no reason why his temporary substitute should\r\nagain represent him; but the Fates had written their decree to the contrary.\r\n\n\r\nDr. Pillule had been summoned to see a rich old hypochondriac at the antique\r\nuniversity town of Bouquin-Moisi, and upon his prescribing change of air and\r\ntravel as remedies, he was retained to accompany the timid patient on a tour of\r\nsome weeks; it but remained, therefore, for the new doctor to continue his\r\nattendance at the Rue Fossette.\r\n\n\r\nI often saw him when he came; for Madame would not trust the little invalid to\r\nTrinette, but required me to spend much of my time in the nursery. I think he\r\nwas skilful. Fifine recovered rapidly under his care, yet even her\r\nconvalescence did not hasten his dismissal. Destiny and Madame Beck seemed in\r\nleague, and both had ruled that he should make deliberate acquaintance with the\r\nvestibule, the private staircase and upper chambers of the Rue Fossette.\r\n\n\r\nNo sooner did Fifine emerge from his hands than D\u00e9sir\u00e9e declared herself ill.\r\nThat possessed child had a genius for simulation, and captivated by the\r\nattentions and indulgences of a sick-room, she came to the conclusion that an\r\nillness would perfectly accommodate her tastes, and took her bed accordingly.\r\nShe acted well, and her mother still better; for while the whole case was\r\ntransparent to Madame Beck as the day, she treated it with an astonishingly\r\nwell-assured air of gravity and good faith.\r\n\n\r\nWhat surprised me was, that Dr. John (so the young Englishman had taught Fifine\r\nto call him, and we all took from her the habit of addressing him by this name,\r\ntill it became an established custom, and he was known by no other in the Rue\r\nFossette)\u2014that Dr. John consented tacitly to adopt Madame\u2019s tactics, and to\r\nfall in with her man\u0153uvres. He betrayed, indeed, a period of comic doubt, cast\r\none or two rapid glances from the child to the mother, indulged in an interval\r\nof self-consultation, but finally resigned himself with a good grace to play\r\nhis part in the farce. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e eat like a raven, gambolled day and night in her\r\nbed, pitched tents with the sheets and blankets, lounged like a Turk amidst\r\npillows and bolsters, diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne and\r\ngrimacing at her sisters\u2014over-flowed, in short, with unmerited health and evil\r\nspirits; only languishing when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal\r\nvisit. Madame Beck, I knew, was glad, at any price, to have her daughter in bed\r\nout of the way of mischief; but I wondered that Dr. John did not tire of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\n\r\nEvery day, on this mere pretext of a motive, he gave punctual attendance;\r\nMadame always received him with the same empressement, the same sunshine for\r\nhimself, the same admirably counterfeited air of concern for her child. Dr.\r\nJohn wrote harmless prescriptions for the patient, and viewed her mother with a\r\nshrewdly sparkling eye. Madame caught his rallying looks without resenting\r\nthem\u2014she had too much good sense for that. Supple as the young doctor seemed,\r\none could not despise him\u2014this pliant part was evidently not adopted in the\r\ndesign to curry favour with his employer: while he liked his office at the\r\npensionnat, and lingered strangely about the Rue Fossette, he was independent,\r\nalmost careless in his carriage there; and yet, too, he was often thoughtful\r\nand preoccupied.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not perhaps my business to observe the mystery of his bearing, or search\r\nout its origin or aim; but, placed as I was, I could hardly help it. He laid\r\nhimself open to my observation, according to my presence in the room just that\r\ndegree of notice and consequence a person of my exterior habitually expects:\r\nthat is to say, about what is given to unobtrusive articles of furniture,\r\nchairs of ordinary joiner\u2019s work, and carpets of no striking pattern. Often,\r\nwhile waiting for Madame, he would muse, smile, watch, or listen like a man who\r\nthinks himself alone. I, meantime, was free to puzzle over his countenance and\r\nmovements, and wonder what could be the meaning of that peculiar interest and\r\nattachment\u2014all mixed up with doubt and strangeness, and inexplicably ruled by\r\nsome presiding spell\u2014which wedded him to this demi-convent, secluded in the\r\nbuilt-up core of a capital. He, I believe, never remembered that I had eyes in\r\nmy head, much less a brain behind them.\r\n\n\r\nNor would he ever have found this out, but that one day, while he sat in the\r\nsunshine and I was observing the colouring of his hair, whiskers, and\r\ncomplexion\u2014the whole being of such a tone as a strong light brings out with\r\nsomewhat perilous force (indeed I recollect I was driven to compare his beamy\r\nhead in my thoughts to that of the \u201cgolden image\u201d which Nebuchadnezzar the king\r\nhad set up), an idea new, sudden, and startling, riveted my attention with an\r\nover-mastering strength and power of attraction. I know not to this day how I\r\nlooked at him: the force of surprise, and also of conviction, made me forget\r\nmyself; and I only recovered wonted consciousness when I saw that his notice\r\nwas arrested, and that it had caught my movement in a clear little oval mirror\r\nfixed in the side of the window recess\u2014by the aid of which reflector Madame\r\noften secretly spied persons walking in the garden below. Though of so gay and\r\nsanguine a temperament, he was not without a certain nervous sensitiveness\r\nwhich made him ill at ease under a direct, inquiring gaze. On surprising me\r\nthus, he turned and said, in a tone which, though courteous, had just so much\r\ndryness in it as to mark a shade of annoyance, as well as to give to what was\r\nsaid the character of rebuke, \u201cMademoiselle does not spare me: I am not vain\r\nenough to fancy that it is my merits which attract her attention; it must then\r\nbe some defect. Dare I ask\u2014what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was confounded, as the reader may suppose, yet not with an irrecoverable\r\nconfusion; being conscious that it was from no emotion of incautious\r\nadmiration, nor yet in a spirit of unjustifiable inquisitiveness, that I had\r\nincurred this reproof. I might have cleared myself on the spot, but would not.\r\nI did not speak. I was not in the habit of speaking to him. Suffering him,\r\nthen, to think what he chose and accuse me of what he would, I resumed some\r\nwork I had dropped, and kept my head bent over it during the remainder of his\r\nstay. There is a perverse mood of the mind which is rather soothed than\r\nirritated by misconstruction; and in quarters where we can never be rightly\r\nknown, we take pleasure, I think, in being consummately ignored. What honest\r\nman, on being casually taken for a housebreaker, does not feel rather tickled\r\nthan vexed at the mistake?\r\n\n"}
{"12": "\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE PORTRESS\u2019S CABINET.\n\r\nIt was summer and very hot. Georgette, the youngest of Madame Beck\u2019s children,\r\ntook a fever. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, suddenly cured of her ailments, was, together with\r\nFifine, packed off to Bonne-Maman, in the country, by way of precaution against\r\ninfection. Medical aid was now really needed, and Madame, choosing to ignore\r\nthe return of Dr. Pillule, who had been at home a week, conjured his English\r\nrival to continue his visits. One or two of the pensionnaires complained of\r\nheadache, and in other respects seemed slightly to participate in Georgette\u2019s\r\nailment. \u201cNow, at last,\u201d I thought, \u201cDr. Pillule must be recalled: the prudent\r\ndirectress will never venture to permit the attendance of so young a man on the\r\npupils.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe directress was very prudent, but she could also be intrepidly venturous.\r\nShe actually introduced Dr. John to the school-division of the premises, and\r\nestablished him in attendance on the proud and handsome Blanche de Melcy, and\r\nthe vain, flirting Ang\u00e9lique, her friend. Dr. John, I thought, testified a\r\ncertain gratification at this mark of confidence; and if discretion of bearing\r\ncould have justified the step, it would by him have been amply justified. Here,\r\nhowever, in this land of convents and confessionals, such a presence as his was\r\nnot to be suffered with impunity in a \u201cpensionnat de demoiselles.\u201d The school\r\ngossiped, the kitchen whispered, the town caught the rumour, parents wrote\r\nletters and paid visits of remonstrance. Madame, had she been weak, would now\r\nhave been lost: a dozen rival educational houses were ready to improve this\r\nfalse step\u2014if false step it were\u2014to her ruin; but Madame was not weak, and\r\nlittle Jesuit though she might be, yet I clapped the hands of my heart, and\r\nwith its voice cried \u201cbrava!\u201d as I watched her able bearing, her skilled\r\nmanagement, her temper and her firmness on this occasion.\r\n\n\r\nShe met the alarmed parents with a good-humoured, easy grace for nobody matched\r\nher in, I know not whether to say the possession or the assumption of a certain\r\n\u201crondeur et franchise de bonne femme;\u201d which on various occasions gained the\r\npoint aimed at with instant and complete success, where severe gravity and\r\nserious reasoning would probably have failed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCe pauvre Docteur Jean!\u201d she would say, chuckling and rubbing joyously her fat\r\nlittle white hands; \u201cce cher jeune homme! le meilleur cr\u00e9ature du monde!\u201d and\r\ngo on to explain how she happened to be employing him for her own children, who\r\nwere so fond of him they would scream themselves into fits at the thought of\r\nanother doctor; how, where she had confidence for her own, she thought it\r\nnatural to repose trust for others, and au reste, it was only the most\r\ntemporary expedient in the world; Blanche and Ang\u00e9lique had the migraine; Dr.\r\nJohn had written a prescription; voil\u00e0 tout!\r\n\n\r\nThe parents\u2019 mouths were closed. Blanche and Ang\u00e9lique saved her all remaining\r\ntrouble by chanting loud duets in their physician\u2019s praise; the other pupils\r\nechoed them, unanimously declaring that when they were ill they would have Dr.\r\nJohn and nobody else; and Madame laughed, and the parents laughed too. The\r\nLabassecouriens must have a large organ of philoprogenitiveness: at least the\r\nindulgence of offspring is carried by them to excessive lengths; the law of\r\nmost households being the children\u2019s will. Madame now got credit for having\r\nacted on this occasion in a spirit of motherly partiality: she came off with\r\nflying colours; people liked her as a directress better than ever.\r\n\n\r\nTo this day I never fully understood why she thus risked her interest for the\r\nsake of Dr. John. What people said, of course I know well: the whole\r\nhouse\u2014pupils, teachers, servants included\u2014affirmed that she was going to marry\r\nhim. So they had settled it; difference of age seemed to make no obstacle in\r\ntheir eyes: it was to be so.\r\n\n\r\nIt must be admitted that appearances did not wholly discountenance this idea;\r\nMadame seemed so bent on retaining his services, so oblivious of her former\r\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9, Pillule. She made, too, such a point of personally receiving his\r\nvisits, and was so unfailingly cheerful, blithe, and benignant in her manner to\r\nhim. Moreover, she paid, about this time, marked attention to dress: the\r\nmorning dishabille, the nightcap and shawl, were discarded; Dr. John\u2019s early\r\nvisits always found her with auburn braids all nicely arranged, silk dress\r\ntrimly fitted on, neat laced brodequins in lieu of slippers: in short the whole\r\ntoilette complete as a model, and fresh as a flower. I scarcely think, however,\r\nthat her intention in this went further than just to show a very handsome man\r\nthat she was not quite a plain woman; and plain she was not. Without beauty of\r\nfeature or elegance of form, she pleased. Without youth and its gay graces, she\r\ncheered. One never tired of seeing her: she was never monotonous, or insipid,\r\nor colourless, or flat. Her unfaded hair, her eye with its temperate blue\r\nlight, her cheek with its wholesome fruit-like bloom\u2014these things pleased in\r\nmoderation, but with constancy.\r\n\n\r\nHad she, indeed, floating visions of adopting Dr. John as a husband, taking him\r\nto her well-furnished home, endowing him with her savings, which were said to\r\namount to a moderate competency, and making him comfortable for the rest of his\r\nlife? Did Dr. John suspect her of such visions? I have met him coming out of\r\nher presence with a mischievous half-smile about his lips, and in his eyes a\r\nlook as of masculine vanity elate and tickled. With all his good looks and\r\ngood-nature, he was not perfect; he must have been very imperfect if he\r\nroguishly encouraged aims he never intended to be successful. But did he not\r\nintend them to be successful? People said he had no money, that he was wholly\r\ndependent upon his profession. Madame\u2014though perhaps some fourteen years his\r\nsenior\u2014was yet the sort of woman never to grow old, never to wither, never to\r\nbreak down. They certainly were on good terms. He perhaps was not in\r\nlove; but how many people ever do love, or at least marry for love, in\r\nthis world. We waited the end.\r\n\n\r\nFor what he waited, I do not know, nor for what he watched; but the\r\npeculiarity of his manner, his expectant, vigilant, absorbed, eager look, never\r\nwore off: it rather intensified. He had never been quite within the compass of\r\nmy penetration, and I think he ranged farther and farther beyond it.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning little Georgette had been more feverish and consequently more\r\npeevish; she was crying, and would not be pacified. I thought a particular\r\ndraught ordered, disagreed with her, and I doubted whether it ought to be\r\ncontinued; I waited impatiently for the doctor\u2019s coming in order to consult\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, he was admitted; I felt sure of this, for I heard his voice\r\naddressing the portress. It was his custom to mount straight to the nursery,\r\ntaking about three degrees of the staircase at once, and coming upon us like a\r\ncheerful surprise. Five minutes elapsed\u2014ten\u2014and I saw and heard nothing of him.\r\nWhat could he be doing? Possibly waiting in the corridor below. Little\r\nGeorgette still piped her plaintive wail, appealing to me by her familiar term,\r\n\u201cMinnie, Minnie, me very poorly!\u201d till my heart ached. I descended to ascertain\r\nwhy he did not come. The corridor was empty. Whither was he vanished? Was he\r\nwith Madame in the salle-\u00e0-manger? Impossible: I had left her but a\r\nshort time since, dressing in her own chamber. I listened. Three pupils were\r\njust then hard at work practising in three proximate rooms\u2014the dining-room and\r\nthe greater and lesser drawing-rooms, between which and the corridor there was\r\nbut the portress\u2019s cabinet communicating with the salons, and intended\r\noriginally for a boudoir. Farther off, at a fourth instrument in the oratory, a\r\nwhole class of a dozen or more were taking a singing lesson, and just then\r\njoining in a \u201cbarcarole\u201d (I think they called it), whereof I yet remember these\r\nwords \u201cfra\u00eech\u00eb,\u201d \u201cbris\u00eb,\u201d and \u201cVenis\u00eb.\u201d Under these circumstances, what could I\r\nhear? A great deal, certainly; had it only been to the purpose.\r\n\n\r\nYes; I heard a giddy treble laugh in the above-mentioned little cabinet, close\r\nby the door of which I stood\u2014that door half-unclosed; a man\u2019s voice in a soft,\r\ndeep, pleading tone, uttered some words, whereof I only caught the adjuration,\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d Then, after a second\u2019s pause, forth issued Dr. John, his eye\r\nfull shining, but not with either joy or triumph; his fair English cheek\r\nhigh-coloured; a baffled, tortured, anxious, and yet a tender meaning on his\r\nbrow.\r\n\n\r\nThe open door served me as a screen; but had I been full in his way, I believe\r\nhe would have passed without seeing me. Some mortification, some strong\r\nvexation had hold of his soul: or rather, to write my impressions now as I\r\nreceived them at the time I should say some sorrow, some sense of injustice. I\r\ndid not so much think his pride was hurt, as that his affections had been\r\nwounded\u2014cruelly wounded, it seemed to me. But who was the torturer? What being\r\nin that house had him so much in her power? Madame I believed to be in her\r\nchamber; the room whence he had stepped was dedicated to the portress\u2019s sole\r\nuse; and she, Rosine Matou, an unprincipled though pretty little French\r\ngrisette, airy, fickle, dressy, vain, and mercenary\u2014it was not, surely, to\r\nher hand he owed the ordeal through which he seemed to have passed?\r\n\n\r\nBut while I pondered, her voice, clear, though somewhat sharp, broke out in a\r\nlightsome French song, trilling through the door still ajar: I glanced in,\r\ndoubting my senses. There at the table she sat in a smart dress of \u201cjaconas\r\nrose,\u201d trimming a tiny blond cap: not a living thing save herself was in the\r\nroom, except indeed some gold fish in a glass globe, some flowers in pots, and\r\na broad July sunbeam.\r\n\n\r\nHere was a problem: but I must go up-stairs to ask about the medicine.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John sat in a chair at Georgette\u2019s bedside; Madame stood before him; the\r\nlittle patient had been examined and soothed, and now lay composed in her crib.\r\nMadame Beck, as I entered, was discussing the physician\u2019s own health, remarking\r\non some real or fancied change in his looks, charging him with over-work, and\r\nrecommending rest and change of air. He listened good-naturedly, but with\r\nlaughing indifference, telling her that she was \u201ctrop bonne,\u201d and that he felt\r\nperfectly well. Madame appealed to me\u2014Dr. John following her movement with a\r\nslow glance which seemed to express languid surprise at reference being made to\r\na quarter so insignificant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Miss Lucie?\u201d asked Madame. \u201cIs he not paler and thinner?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was very seldom that I uttered more than monosyllables in Dr. John\u2019s\r\npresence; he was the kind of person with whom I was likely ever to remain the\r\nneutral, passive thing he thought me. Now, however, I took licence to answer in\r\na phrase: and a phrase I purposely made quite significant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe looks ill at this moment; but perhaps it is owing to some temporary cause:\r\nDr. John may have been vexed or harassed.\u201d I cannot tell how he took this\r\nspeech, as I never sought his face for information. Georgette here began to ask\r\nme in her broken English if she might have a glass of eau sucr\u00e9e. I\r\nanswered her in English. For the first time, I fancy, he noticed that I spoke\r\nhis language; hitherto he had always taken me for a foreigner, addressing me as\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d and giving in French the requisite directions about the\r\nchildren\u2019s treatment. He seemed on the point of making a remark; but thinking\r\nbetter of it, held his tongue.\r\n\n\r\nMadame recommenced advising him; he shook his head, laughing, rose and bid her\r\ngood-morning, with courtesy, but still with the regardless air of one whom too\r\nmuch unsolicited attention was surfeiting and spoiling.\r\n\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Madame dropped into the chair he had just left; she rested\r\nher chin in her hand; all that was animated and amiable vanished from her face:\r\nshe looked stony and stern, almost mortified and morose. She sighed; a single,\r\nbut a deep sigh. A loud bell rang for morning-school. She got up; as she passed\r\na dressing-table with a glass upon it, she looked at her reflected image. One\r\nsingle white hair streaked her nut-brown tresses; she plucked it out with a\r\nshudder. In the full summer daylight, her face, though it still had the colour,\r\ncould plainly be seen to have lost the texture of youth; and then, where were\r\nyouth\u2019s contours? Ah, Madame! wise as you were, even you knew weakness.\r\nNever had I pitied Madame before, but my heart softened towards her, when she\r\nturned darkly from the glass. A calamity had come upon her. That hag\r\nDisappointment was greeting her with a grisly \u201cAll-hail,\u201d and her soul rejected\r\nthe intimacy.\r\n\n\r\nBut Rosine! My bewilderment there surpasses description. I embraced five\r\nopportunities of passing her cabinet that day, with a view to contemplating her\r\ncharms, and finding out the secret of their influence. She was pretty, young,\r\nand wore a well-made dress. All very good points, and, I suppose, amply\r\nsufficient to account, in any philosophic mind, for any amount of agony and\r\ndistraction in a young man, like Dr. John. Still, I could not help forming half\r\na wish that the said doctor were my brother; or at least that he had a sister\r\nor a mother who would kindly sermonize him. I say half a wish; I broke\r\nit, and flung it away before it became a whole one, discovering in good time\r\nits exquisite folly. \u201cSomebody,\u201d I argued, \u201cmight as well sermonize Madame\r\nabout her young physician: and what good would that do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI believe Madame sermonized herself. She did not behave weakly, or make herself\r\nin any shape ridiculous. It is true she had neither strong feelings to\r\novercome, nor tender feelings by which to be miserably pained. It is true\r\nlikewise that she had an important avocation, a real business to fill her time,\r\ndivert her thoughts, and divide her interest. It is especially true that she\r\npossessed a genuine good sense which is not given to all women nor to all men;\r\nand by dint of these combined advantages she behaved wisely\u2014she behaved well.\r\nBrava! once more, Madame Beck. I saw you matched against an Apollyon of a\r\npredilection; you fought a good fight, and you overcame!\r\n\n"}
{"13": "\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE CASKET.\n\r\nBehind the house at the Rue Fossette there was a garden\u2014large, considering that\r\nit lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection at this day it seems\r\npleasant: but time, like distance, lends to certain scenes an influence so\r\nsoftening; and where all is stone around, blank wall and hot pavement, how\r\nprecious seems one shrub, how lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!\r\n\n\r\nThere went a tradition that Madame Beck\u2019s house had in old days been a convent.\r\nThat in years gone by\u2014how long gone by I cannot tell, but I think some\r\ncenturies\u2014before the city had over-spread this quarter, and when it was tilled\r\nground and avenue, and such deep and leafy seclusion as ought to embosom a\r\nreligious house\u2014that something had happened on this site which, rousing fear\r\nand inflicting horror, had left to the place the inheritance of a ghost-story.\r\nA vague tale went of a black and white nun, sometimes, on some night or nights\r\nof the year, seen in some part of this vicinage. The ghost must have been built\r\nout some ages ago, for there were houses all round now; but certain\r\nconvent-relics, in the shape of old and huge fruit-trees, yet consecrated the\r\nspot; and, at the foot of one\u2014a Methuselah of a pear-tree, dead, all but a few\r\nboughs which still faithfully renewed their perfumed snow in spring, and their\r\nhoney-sweet pendants in autumn\u2014you saw, in scraping away the mossy earth\r\nbetween the half-bared roots, a glimpse of slab, smooth, hard, and black. The\r\nlegend went, unconfirmed and unaccredited, but still propagated, that this was\r\nthe portal of a vault, imprisoning deep beneath that ground, on whose surface\r\ngrass grew and flowers bloomed, the bones of a girl whom a monkish conclave of\r\nthe drear middle ages had here buried alive for some sin against her vow. Her\r\nshadow it was that tremblers had feared, through long generations after her\r\npoor frame was dust; her black robe and white veil that, for timid eyes,\r\nmoonlight and shade had mocked, as they fluctuated in the night-wind through\r\nthe garden-thicket.\r\n\n\r\nIndependently of romantic rubbish, however, that old garden had its charms. On\r\nsummer mornings I used to rise early, to enjoy them alone; on summer evenings,\r\nto linger solitary, to keep tryste with the rising moon, or taste one kiss of\r\nthe evening breeze, or fancy rather than feel the freshness of dew descending.\r\nThe turf was verdant, the gravelled walks were white; sun-bright nasturtiums\r\nclustered beautiful about the roots of the doddered orchard giants. There was a\r\nlarge berceau, above which spread the shade of an acacia; there was a smaller,\r\nmore sequestered bower, nestled in the vines which ran all along a high and\r\ngrey wall, and gathered their tendrils in a knot of beauty, and hung their\r\nclusters in loving profusion about the favoured spot where jasmine and ivy met\r\nand married them.\r\n\n\r\nDoubtless at high noon, in the broad, vulgar middle of the day, when Madame\r\nBeck\u2019s large school turned out rampant, and externes and pensionnaires were\r\nspread abroad, vying with the denizens of the boys\u2019 college close at hand, in\r\nthe brazen exercise of their lungs and limbs\u2014doubtless then the garden\r\nwas a trite, trodden-down place enough. But at sunset or the hour of\r\nsalut, when the externes were gone home, and the boarders quiet at their\r\nstudies; pleasant was it then to stray down the peaceful alleys, and hear the\r\nbells of St. Jean Baptiste peal out with their sweet, soft, exalted sound.\r\n\n\r\nI was walking thus one evening, and had been detained farther within the verge\r\nof twilight than usual, by the still-deepening calm, the mellow coolness, the\r\nfragrant breathing with which flowers no sunshine could win now answered the\r\npersuasion of the dew. I saw by a light in the oratory window that the Catholic\r\nhousehold were then gathered to evening prayer\u2014a rite, from attendance on\r\nwhich, I now and then, as a Protestant, exempted myself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne moment longer,\u201d whispered solitude and the summer moon, \u201cstay with us: all\r\nis truly quiet now; for another quarter of an hour your presence will not be\r\nmissed: the day\u2019s heat and bustle have tired you; enjoy these precious\r\nminutes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe windowless backs of houses built in this garden, and in particular the\r\nwhole of one side, was skirted by the rear of a long line of premises\u2014being the\r\nboarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This rear, however, was all blank\r\nstone, with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up, opening from the\r\nsleeping-rooms of the women-servants, and also one casement in a lower story\r\nsaid to mark the chamber or study of a master. But, though thus secure, an\r\nalley, which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was\r\nforbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed \u201cl\u2019all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue,\u201d\r\nand any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe\r\na penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck\u2019s establishment permitted. Teachers\r\nmight indeed go there with impunity; but as the walk was narrow, and the\r\nneglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side, weaving overhead\r\na roof of branch and leaf which the sun\u2019s rays penetrated but in rare chequers,\r\nthis alley was seldom entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully\r\nshunned.\r\n\n\r\nFrom the first I was tempted to make an exception to this rule of avoidance:\r\nthe seclusion, the very gloom of the walk attracted me. For a long time the\r\nfear of seeming singular scared me away; but by degrees, as people became\r\naccustomed to me and my habits, and to such shades of peculiarity as were\r\nengrained in my nature\u2014shades, certainly not striking enough to interest, and\r\nperhaps not prominent enough to offend, but born in and with me, and no more to\r\nbe parted with than my identity\u2014by slow degrees I became a frequenter of this\r\nstrait and narrow path. I made myself gardener of some tintless flowers that\r\ngrew between its closely-ranked shrubs; I cleared away the relics of past\r\nautumns, choking up a rustic seat at the far end. Borrowing of Goton, the\r\ncuisini\u00e8re, a pail of water and a scrubbing-brush, I made this seat clean.\r\nMadame saw me at work and smiled approbation: whether sincerely or not I don\u2019t\r\nknow; but she seemed sincere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoyez-vous,\u201d cried she, \u201ccomme elle est propre, cette demoiselle Lucie? Vous\r\naimez donc cette all\u00e9e, meess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is quiet and shady.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est juste,\u201d cried she with an air of bont\u00e9; and she kindly recommended me to\r\nconfine myself to it as much as I chose, saying, that as I was not charged with\r\nthe surveillance, I need not trouble myself to walk with the pupils: only I\r\nmight permit her children to come there, to talk English with me.\r\n\n\r\nOn the night in question, I was sitting on the hidden seat reclaimed from fungi\r\nand mould, listening to what seemed the far-off sounds of the city. Far off, in\r\ntruth, they were not: this school was in the city\u2019s centre; hence, it was but\r\nfive minutes\u2019 walk to the park, scarce ten to buildings of palatial splendour.\r\nQuite near were wide streets brightly lit, teeming at this moment with life:\r\ncarriages were rolling through them to balls or to the opera. The same hour\r\nwhich tolled curfew for our convent, which extinguished each lamp, and dropped\r\nthe curtain round each couch, rang for the gay city about us the summons to\r\nfestal enjoyment. Of this contrast I thought not, however: gay instincts my\r\nnature had few; ball or opera I had never seen; and though often I had heard\r\nthem described, and even wished to see them, it was not the wish of one who\r\nhopes to partake a pleasure if she could only reach it\u2014who feels fitted to\r\nshine in some bright distant sphere, could she but thither win her way; it was\r\nno yearning to attain, no hunger to taste; only the calm desire to look on a\r\nnew thing.\r\n\n\r\nA moon was in the sky, not a full moon, but a young crescent. I saw her through\r\na space in the boughs overhead. She and the stars, visible beside her, were no\r\nstrangers where all else was strange: my childhood knew them. I had seen that\r\ngolden sign with the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure, beside an\r\nold thorn at the top of an old field, in Old England, in long past days, just\r\nas it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this continental capital.\r\n\n\r\nOh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, little as I spoke, cold\r\nas I looked, when I thought of past days, I could feel. About the\r\npresent, it was better to be stoical; about the future\u2014such a future as mine\u2014to\r\nbe dead. And in catalepsy and a dead trance, I studiously held the quick of my\r\nnature.\r\n\n\r\nAt that time, I well remember whatever could excite\u2014certain accidents of the\r\nweather, for instance, were almost dreaded by me, because they woke the being I\r\nwas always lulling, and stirred up a craving cry I could not satisfy. One night\r\na thunder-storm broke; a sort of hurricane shook us in our beds: the Catholics\r\nrose in panic and prayed to their saints. As for me, the tempest took hold of\r\nme with tyranny: I was roughly roused and obliged to live. I got up and dressed\r\nmyself, and creeping outside the casement close by my bed, sat on its ledge,\r\nwith my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building. It was wet, it was\r\nwild, it was pitch-dark. Within the dormitory they gathered round the\r\nnight-lamp in consternation, praying loud. I could not go in: too resistless\r\nwas the delight of staying with the wild hour, black and full of thunder,\r\npealing out such an ode as language never delivered to man\u2014too terribly\r\nglorious, the spectacle of clouds, split and pierced by white and blinding\r\nbolts.\r\n\n\r\nI did long, achingly, then and for four and twenty hours afterwards, for\r\nsomething to fetch me out of my present existence, and lead me upwards and\r\nonwards. This longing, and all of a similar kind, it was necessary to knock on\r\nthe head; which I did, figuratively, after the manner of Jael to Sisera,\r\ndriving a nail through their temples. Unlike Sisera, they did not die: they\r\nwere but transiently stunned, and at intervals would turn on the nail with a\r\nrebellious wrench: then did the temples bleed, and the brain thrill to its\r\ncore.\r\n\n\r\nTo-night, I was not so mutinous, nor so miserable. My Sisera lay quiet in the\r\ntent, slumbering; and if his pain ached through his slumbers, something like an\r\nangel\u2014the ideal\u2014knelt near, dropping balm on the soothed temples, holding\r\nbefore the sealed eyes a magic glass, of which the sweet, solemn visions were\r\nrepeated in dreams, and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings and robe\r\nover the transfixed sleeper, over the tent threshold, over all the landscape\r\nlying without. Jael, the stern woman; sat apart, relenting somewhat over her\r\ncaptive; but more prone to dwell on the faithful expectation of Heber coming\r\nhome. By which words I mean that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the night\r\nfilled me with a mood of hope: not hope on any definite point, but a general\r\nsense of encouragement and heart-ease.\r\n\n\r\nShould not such a mood, so sweet, so tranquil, so unwonted, have been the\r\nharbinger of good? Alas, no good came of it! I Presently the rude Real burst\r\ncoarsely in\u2014all evil grovelling and repellent as she too often is.\r\n\n\r\nAmid the intense stillness of that pile of stone overlooking the walk, the\r\ntrees, the high wall, I heard a sound; a casement [all the windows here are\r\ncasements, opening on hinges] creaked. Ere I had time to look up and mark\r\nwhere, in which story, or by whom unclosed, a tree overhead shook, as if struck\r\nby a missile; some object dropped prone at my feet.\r\n\n\r\nNine was striking by St. Jean Baptiste\u2019s clock; day was fading, but it was not\r\ndark: the crescent moon aided little, but the deep gilding of that point in\r\nheaven where the sun beamed last, and the crystalline clearness of a wide space\r\nabove, sustained the summer twilight; even in my dark walk I could, by\r\napproaching an opening, have managed to read print of a small type. Easy was it\r\nto see then that the missile was a box, a small box of white and coloured\r\nivory; its loose lid opened in my hand; violets lay within, violets smothering\r\na closely folded bit of pink paper, a note, superscribed, \u201cPour la robe grise.\u201d\r\nI wore indeed a dress of French grey.\r\n\n\r\nGood. Was this a billet-doux? A thing I had heard of, but hitherto had not had\r\nthe honour of seeing or handling. Was it this sort of commodity I held between\r\nmy finger and thumb at this moment?\r\n\n\r\nScarcely: I did not dream it for a moment. Suitor or admirer my very thoughts\r\nhad not conceived. All the teachers had dreams of some lover; one (but she was\r\nnaturally of a credulous turn) believed in a future husband. All the pupils\r\nabove fourteen knew of some prospective bridegroom; two or three were already\r\naffianced by their parents, and had been so from childhood: but into the realm\r\nof feelings and hopes which such prospects open, my speculations, far less my\r\npresumptions, had never once had warrant to intrude. If the other teachers went\r\ninto town, or took a walk on the boulevards, or only attended mass, they were\r\nvery certain (according to the accounts brought back) to meet with some\r\nindividual of the \u201copposite sex,\u201d whose rapt, earnest gaze assured them of\r\ntheir power to strike and to attract. I can\u2019t say that my experience tallied\r\nwith theirs, in this respect. I went to church and I took walks, and am very\r\nwell convinced that nobody minded me. There was not a girl or woman in the Rue\r\nFossette who could not, and did not testify to having received an admiring beam\r\nfrom our young doctor\u2019s blue eyes at one time or other. I am obliged, however\r\nhumbling it may sound, to except myself: as far as I was concerned, those blue\r\neyes were guiltless, and calm as the sky, to whose tint theirs seemed akin. So\r\nit came to pass that I heard the others talk, wondered often at their gaiety,\r\nsecurity, and self-satisfaction, but did not trouble myself to look up and gaze\r\nalong the path they seemed so certain of treading. This then was no\r\nbillet-doux; and it was in settled conviction to the contrary that I quietly\r\nopened it. Thus it ran\u2014I translate:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAngel of my dreams! A thousand, thousand thanks for the promise kept: scarcely\r\ndid I venture to hope its fulfilment. I believed you, indeed, to be half in\r\njest; and then you seemed to think the enterprise beset with such danger\u2014the\r\nhour so untimely, the alley so strictly secluded\u2014often, you said, haunted by\r\nthat dragon, the English teacher\u2014une v\u00e9ritable b\u00e9gueule Britannique \u00e0 ce que\r\nvous dites\u2014esp\u00e8ce de monstre, brusque et rude comme un vieux caporal de\r\ngrenadiers, et rev\u00eache comme une religieuse\u201d (the reader will excuse my modesty\r\nin allowing this flattering sketch of my amiable self to retain the slight veil\r\nof the original tongue). \u201cYou are aware,\u201d went on this precious effusion, \u201cthat\r\nlittle Gustave, on account of his illness, has been removed to a master\u2019s\r\nchamber\u2014that favoured chamber, whose lattice overlooks your prison-ground.\r\nThere, I, the best uncle in the world, am admitted to visit him. How\r\ntremblingly I approached the window and glanced into your Eden\u2014an Eden for me,\r\nthough a desert for you!\u2014how I feared to behold vacancy, or the dragon\r\naforesaid! How my heart palpitated with delight when, through apertures in the\r\nenvious boughs, I at once caught the gleam of your graceful straw-hat, and the\r\nwaving of your grey dress\u2014dress that I should recognise amongst a thousand. But\r\nwhy, my angel, will you not look up? Cruel, to deny me one ray of those\r\nadorable eyes!\u2014how a single glance would have revived me! I write this in fiery\r\nhaste; while the physician examines Gustave, I snatch an opportunity to enclose\r\nit in a small casket, together with a bouquet of flowers, the sweetest that\r\nblow\u2014yet less sweet than thee, my Peri\u2014my all-charming! ever thine-thou well\r\nknowest whom!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish I did know whom,\u201d was my comment; and the wish bore even closer\r\nreference to the person addressed in this choice document, than to the writer\r\nthereof. Perhaps it was from the fianc\u00e9 of one of the engaged pupils; and, in\r\nthat case, there was no great harm done or intended\u2014only a small irregularity.\r\nSeveral of the girls, the majority, indeed, had brothers or cousins at the\r\nneighbouring college. But \u201cla robe grise, le chapeau de paille,\u201d here surely\r\nwas a clue\u2014a very confusing one. The straw-hat was an ordinary garden\r\nhead-screen, common to a score besides myself. The grey dress hardly gave more\r\ndefinite indication. Madame Beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress just now;\r\nanother teacher, and three of the pensionnaires, had had grey dresses purchased\r\nof the same shade and fabric as mine: it was a sort of every-day wear which\r\nhappened at that time to be in vogue.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, as I pondered, I knew I must go in. Lights, moving in the dormitory,\r\nannounced that prayers were over, and the pupils going to bed. Another\r\nhalf-hour and all doors would be locked\u2014all lights extinguished. The front door\r\nyet stood open, to admit into the heated house the coolness of the summer\r\nnight; from the portress\u2019s cabinet close by shone a lamp, showing the long\r\nvestibule with the two-leaved drawing-room doors on one side, the great\r\nstreet-door closing the vista.\r\n\n\r\nAll at once, quick rang the bell\u2014quick, but not loud\u2014a cautious tinkle\u2014a sort\r\nof warning metal whisper. Rosine darted from her cabinet and ran to open. The\r\nperson she admitted stood with her two minutes in parley: there seemed a demur,\r\na delay. Rosine came to the garden door, lamp in hand; she stood on the steps,\r\nlifting her lamp, looking round vaguely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel conte!\u201d she cried, with a coquettish laugh. \u201cPersonne n\u2019y a \u00e9t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me pass,\u201d pleaded a voice I knew: \u201cI ask but five minutes;\u201d and a familiar\r\nshape, tall and grand (as we of the Rue Fossette all thought it), issued from\r\nthe house, and strode down amongst the beds and walks. It was sacrilege\u2014the\r\nintrusion of a man into that spot, at that hour; but he knew himself\r\nprivileged, and perhaps he trusted to the friendly night. He wandered down the\r\nalleys, looking on this side and on that\u2014he was lost in the shrubs, trampling\r\nflowers and breaking branches in his search\u2014he penetrated at last the\r\n\u201cforbidden walk.\u201d There I met him, like some ghost, I suppose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John! it is found.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe did not ask by whom, for with his quick eye he perceived that I held it in\r\nmy hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not betray her,\u201d he said, looking at me as if I were indeed a dragon.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere I ever so disposed to treachery, I cannot betray what I do not know,\u201d was\r\nmy answer. \u201cRead the note, and you will see how little it reveals.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you have read it,\u201d I thought to myself; and yet I could not believe he\r\nwrote it: that could hardly be his style: besides, I was fool enough to think\r\nthere would be a degree of hardship in his calling me such names. His own look\r\nvindicated him; he grew hot, and coloured as he read.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed too much: this is cruel, this is humiliating,\u201d were the words\r\nthat fell from him.\r\n\n\r\nI thought it was cruel, when I saw his countenance so moved. No matter\r\nwhether he was to blame or not; somebody, it seemed to me, must be more to\r\nblame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall you do about it?\u201d he inquired of me. \u201cShall you tell Madame Beck\r\nwhat you have found, and cause a stir\u2014an esclandre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I ought to tell, and said so; adding that I did not believe there\r\nwould be either stir or esclandre: Madame was much too prudent to make a noise\r\nabout an affair of that sort connected with her establishment.\r\n\n\r\nHe stood looking down and meditating. He was both too proud and too honourable\r\nto entreat my secresy on a point which duty evidently commanded me to\r\ncommunicate. I wished to do right, yet loathed to grieve or injure him. Just\r\nthen Rosine glanced out through the open door; she could not see us, though\r\nbetween the trees I could plainly see her: her dress was grey, like mine. This\r\ncircumstance, taken in connection with prior transactions, suggested to me that\r\nperhaps the case, however deplorable, was one in which I was under no\r\nobligation whatever to concern myself. Accordingly, I said,\u2014\u201cIf you can assure\r\nme that none of Madame Beck\u2019s pupils are implicated in this business, I shall\r\nbe very happy to stand aloof from all interference. Take the casket, the\r\nbouquet, and the billet; for my part, I gladly forget the whole affair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d he whispered suddenly, as his hand closed on what I offered, and\r\nat the same time he pointed through the boughs.\r\n\n\r\nI looked. Behold Madame, in shawl, wrapping-gown, and slippers, softly\r\ndescending the steps, and stealing like a cat round the garden: in two minutes\r\nshe would have been upon Dr. John. If she were like a cat, however,\r\nhe, quite as much, resembled a leopard: nothing could be lighter than\r\nhis tread when he chose. He watched, and as she turned a corner, he took the\r\ngarden at two noiseless bounds. She reappeared, and he was gone. Rosine helped\r\nhim, instantly interposing the door between him and his huntress. I, too, might\r\nhave got away, but I preferred to meet Madame openly.\r\n\n\r\nThough it was my frequent and well-known custom to spend twilight in the\r\ngarden, yet, never till now, had I remained so late. Full sure was I that\r\nMadame had missed\u2014was come in search of me, and designed now to pounce on the\r\ndefaulter unawares. I expected a reprimand. No. Madame was all goodness. She\r\ntendered not even a remonstrance; she testified no shade of surprise. With that\r\nconsummate tact of hers, in which I believe she was never surpassed by living\r\nthing, she even professed merely to have issued forth to taste \u201cla brise du\r\nsoir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuelle belle nuit!\u201d cried she, looking up at the stars\u2014the moon was now gone\r\ndown behind the broad tower of Jean Baptiste. \u201cQu\u2019il fait bon? que l\u2019air est\r\nfrais!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd, instead of sending me in, she detained me to take a few turns with her\r\ndown the principal alley. When at last we both re-entered, she leaned affably\r\non my shoulder by way of support in mounting the front-door steps; at parting,\r\nher cheek was presented to my lips, and \u201cBon soir, my bonne amie; dormez bien!\u201d\r\nwas her kindly adieu for the night.\r\n\n\r\nI caught myself smiling as I lay awake and thoughtful on my couch\u2014smiling at\r\nMadame. The unction, the suavity of her behaviour offered, for one who knew\r\nher, a sure token that suspicion of some kind was busy in her brain. From some\r\naperture or summit of observation, through parted bough or open window, she had\r\ndoubtless caught a glimpse, remote or near, deceptive or instructive, of that\r\nnight\u2019s transactions. Finely accomplished as she was in the art of\r\nsurveillance, it was next to impossible that a casket could be thrown into her\r\ngarden, or an interloper could cross her walks to seek it, without that she, in\r\nshaken branch, passing shade, unwonted footfall, or stilly murmur (and though\r\nDr. John had spoken very low in the few words he dropped me, yet the hum of his\r\nman\u2019s voice pervaded, I thought, the whole conventual ground)\u2014without, I say,\r\nthat she should have caught intimation of things extraordinary transpiring on\r\nher premises. What things, she might by no means see, or at that time be\r\nable to discover; but a delicious little ravelled plot lay tempting her to\r\ndisentanglement; and in the midst, folded round and round in cobwebs, had she\r\nnot secured \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d clumsily involved, like the foolish fly she was?\r\n\n"}
{"14": "\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON.\n\r\nI had occasion to smile\u2014nay, to laugh, at Madame again, within the space of\r\nfour and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the last chapter.\r\n\n\r\nVillette owns a climate as variable, though not so humid, as that of any\r\nEnglish town. A night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset, and all the\r\nnext day was one of dry storm\u2014dark, beclouded, yet rainless,\u2014the streets were\r\ndim with sand and dust, whirled from the boulevards. I know not that even\r\nlovely weather would have tempted me to spend the evening-time of study and\r\nrecreation where I had spent it yesterday. My alley, and, indeed, all the walks\r\nand shrubs in the garden, had acquired a new, but not a pleasant interest;\r\ntheir seclusion was now become precarious; their calm\u2014insecure. That casement\r\nwhich rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked; and\r\nelsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained vision, and the knots in the\r\ntree-boles listened like secret ears. Some plants there were, indeed, trodden\r\ndown by Dr. John in his search, and his hasty and heedless progress, which I\r\nwished to prop up, water, and revive; some footmarks, too, he had left on the\r\nbeds: but these, in spite of the strong wind, I found a moment\u2019s leisure to\r\nefface very early in the morning, ere common eyes had discovered them. With a\r\npensive sort of content, I sat down to my desk and my German, while the pupils\r\nsettled to their evening lessons; and the other teachers took up their\r\nneedlework.\r\n\n\r\nThe scene of the \u201cetude du soir\u201d was always the refectory, a much smaller\r\napartment than any of the three classes or schoolrooms; for here none, save the\r\nboarders, were ever admitted, and these numbered only a score. Two lamps hung\r\nfrom the ceiling over the two tables; these were lit at dusk, and their\r\nkindling was the signal for school-books being set aside, a grave demeanour\r\nassumed, general silence enforced, and then commenced \u201cla lecture pieuse.\u201d This\r\nsaid \u201clecture pieuse\u201d was, I soon found, mainly designed as a wholesome\r\nmortification of the Intellect, a useful humiliation of the Reason; and such a\r\ndose for Common Sense as she might digest at her leisure, and thrive on as she\r\nbest could.\r\n\n\r\nThe book brought out (it was never changed, but when finished, recommenced) was\r\na venerable volume, old as the hills\u2014grey as the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\r\n\n\r\nI would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my\r\nhands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and\r\nperusing with my own eyes the enormous figments which, as an unworthy heretic,\r\nit was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears. This book\r\ncontained legends of the saints. Good God! (I speak the words reverently) what\r\nlegends they were. What gasconading rascals those saints must have been, if\r\nthey first boasted these exploits or invented these miracles. These legends,\r\nhowever, were no more than monkish extravagances, over which one laughed\r\ninwardly; there were, besides, priestly matters, and the priestcraft of the\r\nbook was far worse than its monkery. The ears burned on each side of my head as\r\nI listened, perforce, to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by Rome; the dread\r\nboasts of confessors, who had wickedly abused their office, trampling to deep\r\ndegradation high-born ladies, making of countesses and princesses the most\r\ntormented slaves under the sun. Stories like that of Conrad and Elizabeth of\r\nHungary, recurred again and again, with all its dreadful viciousness, sickening\r\ntyranny and black impiety: tales that were nightmares of oppression, privation,\r\nand agony.\r\n\n\r\nI sat out this \u201clecture pieuse\u201d for some nights as well as I could, and as\r\nquietly too; only once breaking off the points of my scissors by involuntarily\r\nsticking them somewhat deep in the worm-eaten board of the table before me.\r\nBut, at last, it made me so burning hot, and my temples, and my heart, and my\r\nwrist throbbed so fast, and my sleep afterwards was so broken with excitement,\r\nthat I could sit no longer. Prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance\r\nof my person from the place, the moment that guilty old book was brought out.\r\nNo Mause Headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against\r\nSergeant Bothwell, than I\u2014to speak my mind in this matter of the popish\r\n\u201clecture pieuse.\u201d However, I did manage somehow to curb and rein in; and though\r\nalways, as soon as Rosine came to light the lamps, I shot from the room\r\nquickly, yet also I did it quietly; seizing that vantage moment given by the\r\nlittle bustle before the dead silence, and vanishing whilst the boarders put\r\ntheir books away.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I vanished\u2014it was into darkness; candles were not allowed to be carried\r\nabout, and the teacher who forsook the refectory, had only the unlit hall,\r\nschoolroom, or bedroom, as a refuge. In winter I sought the long classes, and\r\npaced them fast to keep myself warm\u2014fortunate if the moon shone, and if there\r\nwere only stars, soon reconciled to their dim gleam, or even to the total\r\neclipse of their absence. In summer it was never quite dark, and then I went\r\nup-stairs to my own quarter of the long dormitory, opened my own casement (that\r\nchamber was lit by five casements large as great doors), and leaning out,\r\nlooked forth upon the city beyond the garden, and listened to band-music from\r\nthe park or the palace-square, thinking meantime my own thoughts, living my own\r\nlife, in my own still, shadow-world.\r\n\n\r\nThis evening, fugitive as usual before the Pope and his works, I mounted the\r\nstaircase, approached the dormitory, and quietly opened the door, which was\r\nalways kept carefully shut, and which, like every other door in this house,\r\nrevolved noiselessly on well-oiled hinges. Before I saw, I felt\r\nthat life was in the great room, usually void: not that there was either stir\r\nor breath, or rustle of sound, but Vacuum lacked, Solitude was not at home. All\r\nthe white beds\u2014the \u201clits d\u2019ange,\u201d as they were poetically termed\u2014lay visible at\r\na glance; all were empty: no sleeper reposed therein. The sound of a drawer\r\ncautiously slid out struck my ear; stepping a little to one side, my vision\r\ntook a free range, unimpeded by falling curtains. I now commanded my own bed\r\nand my own toilet, with a locked work-box upon it, and locked drawers\r\nunderneath.\r\n\n\r\nVery good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent shawl and the cleanest of\r\npossible nightcaps, stood before this toilet, hard at work apparently doing me\r\nthe kindness of \u201ctidying out\u201d the \u201cmeuble.\u201d Open stood the lid of the work-box,\r\nopen the top drawer; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in\r\nturn: not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded, not a paper\r\nbut was glanced over, not a little box but was unlidded; and beautiful was the\r\nadroitness, exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished. Madame\r\nwrought at it like a true star, \u201cunhasting yet unresting.\u201d I will not deny that\r\nit was with a secret glee I watched her. Had I been a gentleman I believe\r\nMadame would have found favour in my eyes, she was so handy, neat, thorough in\r\nall she did: some people\u2019s movements provoke the soul by their loose\r\nawkwardness, hers\u2014satisfied by their trim compactness. I stood, in short,\r\nfascinated; but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell, a\r\nretreat must be beaten. The searcher might have turned and caught me; there\r\nwould have been nothing for it then but a scene, and she and I would have had\r\nto come all at once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough knowledge of each\r\nother: down would have gone conventionalities, away swept disguises, and\r\nI should have looked into her eyes, and she into mine\u2014we should have\r\nknown that we could work together no more, and parted in this life for ever.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was the use of tempting such a catastrophe? I was not angry, and had no\r\nwish in the world to leave her. I could hardly get another employer whose yoke\r\nwould be so light and so easy of carriage; and truly I liked Madame for her\r\ncapital sense, whatever I might think of her principles: as to her system, it\r\ndid me no harm; she might work me with it to her heart\u2019s content: nothing would\r\ncome of the operation. Loverless and inexpectant of love, I was as safe from\r\nspies in my heart-poverty, as the beggar from thieves in his destitution of\r\npurse. I turned, then, and fled; descending the stairs with progress as swift\r\nand soundless as that of the spider, which at the same instant ran down the\r\nbannister.\r\n\n\r\nHow I laughed when I reached the schoolroom. I knew now she had certainly seen\r\nDr. John in the garden; I knew what her thoughts were. The spectacle of a\r\nsuspicious nature so far misled by its own inventions, tickled me much. Yet as\r\nthe laugh died, a kind of wrath smote me, and then bitterness followed: it was\r\nthe rock struck, and Meribah\u2019s waters gushing out. I never had felt so strange\r\nand contradictory an inward tumult as I felt for an hour that evening: soreness\r\nand laughter, and fire, and grief, shared my heart between them. I cried hot\r\ntears: not because Madame mistrusted me\u2014I did not care twopence for her\r\nmistrust\u2014but for other reasons. Complicated, disquieting thoughts broke up the\r\nwhole repose of my nature. However, that turmoil subsided: next day I was again\r\nLucy Snowe.\r\n\n\r\nOn revisiting my drawers, I found them all securely locked; the closest\r\nsubsequent examination could not discover change or apparent disturbance in the\r\nposition of one object. My few dresses were folded as I had left them; a\r\ncertain little bunch of white violets that had once been silently presented to\r\nme by a stranger (a stranger to me, for we had never exchanged words), and\r\nwhich I had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds of my best\r\ndress, lay there unstirred; my black silk scarf, my lace chemisette and\r\ncollars, were unrumpled. Had she creased one solitary article, I own I should\r\nhave felt much greater difficulty in forgiving her; but finding all straight\r\nand orderly, I said, \u201cLet bygones be bygones. I am unharmed: why should I bear\r\nmalice?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA thing there was which puzzled myself, and I sought in my brain a key to that\r\nriddle almost as sedulously as Madame had sought a guide to useful knowledge in\r\nmy toilet drawers. How was it that Dr. John, if he had not been accessory to\r\nthe dropping of that casket into the garden, should have known that it\r\nwas dropped, and appeared so promptly on the spot to seek it? So strong\r\nwas the wish to clear up this point that I began to entertain this daring\r\nsuggestion: \u201cWhy may I not, in case I should ever have the opportunity, ask Dr.\r\nJohn himself to explain this coincidence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so long as Dr. John was absent, I really believed I had courage to test him\r\nwith such a question.\r\n\n\r\nLittle Georgette was now convalescent; and her physician accordingly made his\r\nvisits very rare: indeed, he would have ceased them altogether, had not Madame\r\ninsisted on his giving an occasional call till the child should be quite well.\r\n\n\r\nShe came into the nursery one evening just after I had listened to Georgette\u2019s\r\nlisped and broken prayer, and had put her to bed. Taking the little one\u2019s hand,\r\nshe said, \u201cCette enfant a toujours un peu de fi\u00e8vre.\u201d And presently afterwards,\r\nlooking at me with a quicker glance than was habitual to her quiet eye, \u201cLe\r\nDocteur John l\u2019a-t-il vue derni\u00e8rement? Non, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course she knew this better than any other person in the house. \u201cWell,\u201d she\r\ncontinued, \u201cI am going out, pour faire quelques courses en fiacre. I shall call\r\non Dr. John, and send him to the child. I will that he sees her this evening;\r\nher cheeks are flushed, her pulse is quick; you will receive him\u2014for my\r\npart, I shall be from home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow the child was well enough, only warm with the warmth of July; it was\r\nscarcely less needful to send for a priest to administer extreme unction than\r\nfor a doctor to prescribe a dose; also Madame rarely made \u201ccourses,\u201d as she\r\ncalled them, in the evening: moreover, this was the first time she had chosen\r\nto absent herself on the occasion of a visit from Dr. John. The whole\r\narrangement indicated some plan; this I saw, but without the least anxiety.\r\n\u201cHa! ha! Madame,\u201d laughed Light-heart the Beggar, \u201cyour crafty wits are on the\r\nwrong tack.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe departed, attired very smartly, in a shawl of price, and a certain\r\nchapeau vert tendre\u2014hazardous, as to its tint, for any complexion less\r\nfresh than her own, but, to her, not unbecoming. I wondered what she intended:\r\nwhether she really would send Dr. John or not; or whether indeed he would come:\r\nhe might be engaged.\r\n\n\r\nMadame had charged me not to let Georgette sleep till the doctor came; I had\r\ntherefore sufficient occupation in telling her nursery tales and palavering the\r\nlittle language for her benefit. I affected Georgette; she was a sensitive and\r\na loving child: to hold her in my lap, or carry her in my arms, was to me a\r\ntreat. To-night she would have me lay my head on the pillow of her crib; she\r\neven put her little arms round my neck. Her clasp, and the nestling action with\r\nwhich she pressed her cheek to mine, made me almost cry with a tender pain.\r\nFeeling of no kind abounded in that house; this pure little drop from a pure\r\nlittle source was too sweet: it penetrated deep, and subdued the heart, and\r\nsent a gush to the eyes. Half an hour or an hour passed; Georgette murmured in\r\nher soft lisp that she was growing sleepy. \u201cAnd you shall sleep,\u201d\r\nthought I, \u201cmalgr\u00e9 maman and m\u00e9decin, if they are not here in ten minutes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHark! There was the ring, and there the tread, astonishing the staircase by the\r\nfleetness with which it left the steps behind. Rosine introduced Dr. John, and,\r\nwith a freedom of manner not altogether peculiar to herself, but characteristic\r\nof the domestics of Villette generally, she stayed to hear what he had to say.\r\nMadame\u2019s presence would have awed her back to her own realm of the vestibule\r\nand the cabinet\u2014for mine, or that of any other teacher or pupil, she cared not\r\na jot. Smart, trim and pert, she stood, a hand in each pocket of her gay\r\ngrisette apron, eyeing Dr. John with no more fear or shyness than if he had\r\nbeen a picture instead of a living gentleman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLe marmot n\u2019a rien n\u2019est ce pas?\u201d said she, indicating Georgette with a jerk\r\nof her chin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPas beaucoup,\u201d was the answer, as the doctor hastily scribbled with his pencil\r\nsome harmless prescription.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien!\u201d pursued Rosine, approaching him quite near, while he put up his\r\npencil. \u201cAnd the box\u2014did you get it? Monsieur went off like a coup-de-vent the\r\nother night; I had not time to ask him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI found it: yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who threw it, then?\u201d continued Rosine, speaking quite freely the very\r\nwords I should so much have wished to say, but had no address or courage to\r\nbring it out: how short some people make the road to a point which, for others,\r\nseems unattainable!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat may be my secret,\u201d rejoined Dr. John briefly, but with no sort of\r\nhauteur: he seemed quite to understand the Rosine or grisette character.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais enfin,\u201d continued she, nothing abashed, \u201cmonsieur knew it was thrown,\r\nsince he came to seek it\u2014how did he know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was attending a little patient in the college near,\u201d said he, \u201cand saw it\r\ndropped out of his chamber window, and so came to pick it up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow simple the whole explanation! The note had alluded to a physician as then\r\nexamining \u201cGustave.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh \u00e7a!\u201d pursued Rosine; \u201cil n\u2019y a donc rien l\u00e0-dessous: pas de myst\u00e8re, pas\r\nd\u2019amourette, par exemple?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPas plus que sur ma main,\u201d responded the doctor, showing his palm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel dommage!\u201d responded the grisette: \u201cet moi\u2014\u00e0 qui tout cela commen\u00e7ait \u00e0\r\ndonner des id\u00e9es.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVraiment! vous en \u00eates pour vos frais,\u201d was the doctor\u2019s cool rejoinder.\r\n\n\r\nShe pouted. The doctor could not help laughing at the sort of \u201cmoue\u201d she made:\r\nwhen he laughed, he had something peculiarly good-natured and genial in his\r\nlook. I saw his hand incline to his pocket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow many times have you opened the door for me within this last month?\u201d he\r\nasked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur ought to have kept count of that,\u201d said Rosine, quite readily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if I had not something better to do!\u201d rejoined he; but I saw him give her a\r\npiece of gold, which she took unscrupulously, and then danced off to answer the\r\ndoor-bell, ringing just now every five minutes, as the various servants came to\r\nfetch the half-boarders.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader must not think too hardly of Rosine; on the whole, she was not a bad\r\nsort of person, and had no idea there could be any disgrace in grasping at\r\nwhatever she could get, or any effrontery in chattering like a pie to the best\r\ngentleman in Christendom.\r\n\n\r\nI had learnt something from the above scene besides what concerned the ivory\r\nbox: viz., that not on the robe de jaconas, pink or grey, nor yet on the\r\nfrilled and pocketed apron, lay the blame of breaking Dr. John\u2019s heart: these\r\nitems of array were obviously guiltless as Georgette\u2019s little blue tunic. So\r\nmuch the better. But who then was the culprit? What was the ground\u2014what the\r\norigin\u2014what the perfect explanation of the whole business? Some points had been\r\ncleared, but how many yet remained obscure as night!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cit is no affair of yours;\u201d and turning from the\r\nface on which I had been unconsciously dwelling with a questioning gaze, I\r\nlooked through the window which commanded the garden below. Dr. John, meantime,\r\nstanding by the bed-side, was slowly drawing on his gloves and watching his\r\nlittle patient, as her eyes closed and her rosy lips parted in coming sleep. I\r\nwaited till he should depart as usual, with a quick bow and scarce articulate\r\n\u201cgood-night.\u201d. Just as he took his hat, my eyes, fixed on the tall houses\r\nbounding the garden, saw the one lattice, already commemorated, cautiously\r\nopen; forth from the aperture projected a hand and a white handkerchief; both\r\nwaved. I know not whether the signal was answered from some viewless quarter of\r\nour own dwelling; but immediately after there fluttered from the lattice a\r\nfalling object, white and light\u2014billet the second, of course.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d I ejaculated involuntarily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d, asked Dr. John with energy, making direct for the window. \u201cWhat, is\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have gone and done it again,\u201d was my reply. \u201cA handkerchief waved and\r\nsomething fell:\u201d and I pointed to the lattice, now closed and looking\r\nhypocritically blank.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo, at once; pick it up and bring it here,\u201d was his prompt direction; adding,\r\n\u201cNobody will take notice of you: I should be seen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStraight I went. After some little search, I found a folded paper, lodged on\r\nthe lower branch of a shrub; I seized and brought it direct to Dr. John. This\r\ntime, I believe not even Rosine saw me.\r\n\n\r\nHe instantly tore the billet into small pieces, without reading it. \u201cIt is not\r\nin the least her fault, you must remember,\u201d he said, looking at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhose fault?\u201d I asked. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t yet know, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you no guess?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I knew you better, I might be tempted to risk some confidence, and thus\r\nsecure you as guardian over a most innocent and excellent, but somewhat\r\ninexperienced being.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs a duenna?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he abstractedly. \u201cWhat snares are round her!\u201d he added, musingly:\r\nand now, certainly for the first time, he examined my face, anxious, doubtless,\r\nto see if any kindly expression there, would warrant him in recommending to my\r\ncare and indulgence some ethereal creature, against whom powers of darkness\r\nwere plotting. I felt no particular vocation to undertake the surveillance of\r\nethereal creatures; but recalling the scene at the bureau, it seemed to me that\r\nI owed him a good turn: if I could help him then I would, and it\r\nlay not with me to decide how. With as little reluctance as might be, I\r\nintimated that \u201cI was willing to do what I could towards taking care of any\r\nperson in whom he might be interested.\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am no farther interested than as a spectator,\u201d said he, with a modesty,\r\nadmirable, as I thought, to witness. \u201cI happen to be acquainted with the rather\r\nworthless character of the person, who, from the house opposite, has now twice\r\ninvaded the sanctity of this place; I have also met in society the object at\r\nwhom these vulgar attempts are aimed. Her exquisite superiority and innate\r\nrefinement ought, one would think, to scare impertinence from her very idea. It\r\nis not so, however; and innocent, unsuspicious as she is, I would guard her\r\nfrom evil if I could. In person, however, I can do nothing, I cannot come near\r\nher\u201d\u2014he paused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I am willing to help you,\u201d said I, \u201conly tell me how.\u201d And busily, in my\r\nown mind, I ran over the list of our inmates, seeking this paragon, this pearl\r\nof great price, this gem without flaw. \u201cIt must be Madame,\u201d I concluded.\r\n\u201cShe only, amongst us all, has the art even to seem superior: but\r\nas to being unsuspicious, inexperienced, &c., Dr. John need not distract\r\nhimself about that. However, this is just his whim, and I will not contradict\r\nhim; he shall be humoured: his angel shall be an angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust notify the quarter to which my care is to be directed,\u201d I continued\r\ngravely: chuckling, however, to myself over the thought of being set to\r\nchaperon Madame Beck or any of her pupils. Now Dr. John had a fine set of\r\nnerves, and he at once felt by instinct, what no more coarsely constituted mind\r\nwould have detected; namely, that I was a little amused at him. The colour rose\r\nto his cheek; with half a smile he turned and took his hat\u2014he was going. My\r\nheart smote me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will\u2014I will help you,\u201d said I eagerly. \u201cI will do what you wish. I will\r\nwatch over your angel; I will take care of her, only tell me who she is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you must know,\u201d said he then with earnestness, yet speaking very\r\nlow. \u201cSo spotless, so good, so unspeakably beautiful! impossible that one house\r\nshould contain two like her. I allude, of course\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere the latch of Madame Beck\u2019s chamber-door (opening into the nursery) gave a\r\nsudden click, as if the hand holding it had been slightly convulsed; there was\r\nthe suppressed explosion of an irrepressible sneeze. These little accidents\r\nwill happen to the best of us. Madame\u2014excellent woman! was then on duty. She\r\nhad come home quietly, stolen up-stairs on tip-toe; she was in her chamber. If\r\nshe had not sneezed, she would have heard all, and so should I; but that\r\nunlucky sternutation routed Dr. John. While he stood aghast, she came forward\r\nalert, composed, in the best yet most tranquil spirits: no novice to her habits\r\nbut would have thought she had just come in, and scouted the idea of her ear\r\nhaving been glued to the key-hole for at least ten minutes. She affected to\r\nsneeze again, declared she was \u201cenrhum\u00e9e,\u201d and then proceeded volubly to\r\nrecount her \u201ccourses en fiacre.\u201d The prayer-bell rang, and I left her with the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\n"}
{"15": "\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE F\u00caTE.\n\r\nAs soon as Georgette was well, Madame sent her away into the country. I was\r\nsorry; I loved the child, and her loss made me poorer than before. But I must\r\nnot complain. I lived in a house full of robust life; I might have had\r\ncompanions, and I chose solitude. Each of the teachers in turn made me\r\novertures of special intimacy; I tried them all. One I found to be an honest\r\nwoman, but a narrow thinker, a coarse feeler, and an egotist. The second was a\r\nParisienne, externally refined\u2014at heart, corrupt\u2014without a creed, without a\r\nprinciple, without an affection: having penetrated the outward crust of decorum\r\nin this character, you found a slough beneath. She had a wonderful passion for\r\npresents; and, in this point, the third teacher\u2014a person otherwise\r\ncharacterless and insignificant\u2014closely resembled her. This last-named had also\r\none other distinctive property\u2014that of avarice. In her reigned the love of\r\nmoney for its own sake. The sight of a piece of gold would bring into her eyes\r\na green glisten, singular to witness. She once, as a mark of high favour, took\r\nme up-stairs, and, opening a secret door, showed me a hoard\u2014a mass of coarse,\r\nlarge coin\u2014about fifteen guineas, in five-franc pieces. She loved this hoard as\r\na bird loves its eggs. These were her savings. She would come and talk to me\r\nabout them with an infatuated and persevering dotage, strange to behold in a\r\nperson not yet twenty-five.\r\n\n\r\nThe Parisienne, on the other hand, was prodigal and profligate (in disposition,\r\nthat is: as to action, I do not know). That latter quality showed its\r\nsnake-head to me but once, peeping out very cautiously. A curious kind of\r\nreptile it seemed, judging from the glimpse I got; its novelty whetted my\r\ncuriosity: if it would have come out boldly, perhaps I might philosophically\r\nhave stood my ground, and coolly surveyed the long thing from forked tongue to\r\nscaly tail-tip; but it merely rustled in the leaves of a bad novel; and, on\r\nencountering a hasty and ill-advised demonstration of wrath, recoiled and\r\nvanished, hissing. She hated me from that day.\r\n\n\r\nThis Parisienne was always in debt; her salary being anticipated, not only in\r\ndress, but in perfumes, cosmetics, confectionery, and condiments. What a cold,\r\ncallous epicure she was in all things! I see her now. Thin in face and figure,\r\nsallow in complexion, regular in features, with perfect teeth, lips like a\r\nthread, a large, prominent chin, a well-opened, but frozen eye, of light at\r\nonce craving and ingrate. She mortally hated work, and loved what she called\r\npleasure; being an insipid, heartless, brainless dissipation of time.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck knew this woman\u2019s character perfectly well. She once talked to me\r\nabout her, with an odd mixture of discrimination, indifference, and antipathy.\r\nI asked why she kept her in the establishment. She answered plainly, \u201cbecause\r\nit suited her interest to do so;\u201d and pointed out a fact I had already noticed,\r\nnamely, that Mademoiselle St. Pierre possessed, in an almost unique degree, the\r\npower of keeping order amongst her undisciplined ranks of scholars. A certain\r\npetrifying influence accompanied and surrounded her: without passion, noise, or\r\nviolence, she held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might still a\r\nbrawling stream. She was of little use as far as communication of knowledge\r\nwent, but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules she was invaluable.\r\n\u201cJe sais bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas de principes, ni, peut-\u00eatre, de moeurs,\u201d admitted\r\nMadame frankly; but added with philosophy, \u201cson maintien en classe est toujours\r\nconvenable et rempli m\u00eame d\u2019une certaine dignit\u00e9: c\u2019est tout ce qu\u2019il faut. Ni\r\nles \u00e9l\u00e8ves ni les parents ne regardent plus loin; ni, par cons\u00e9quent, moi non\r\nplus.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA strange, frolicsome, noisy little world was this school: great pains were\r\ntaken to hide chains with flowers: a subtle essence of Romanism pervaded every\r\narrangement: large sensual indulgence (so to speak) was permitted by way of\r\ncounterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint. Each mind was being reared in\r\nslavery; but, to prevent reflection from dwelling on this fact, every pretext\r\nfor physical recreation was seized and made the most of. There, as elsewhere,\r\nthe CHURCH strove to bring up her children robust in body, feeble in soul, fat,\r\nruddy, hale, joyous, ignorant, unthinking, unquestioning. \u201cEat, drink, and\r\nlive!\u201d she says. \u201cLook after your bodies; leave your souls to me. I hold their\r\ncure\u2014guide their course: I guarantee their final fate.\u201d A bargain, in which\r\nevery true Catholic deems himself a gainer. Lucifer just offers the same terms:\r\n\u201cAll this power will I give thee, and the glory of it; for that is delivered\r\nunto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship\r\nme, all shall be thine!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAbout this time\u2014in the ripest glow of summer\u2014Madame Beck\u2019s house became as\r\nmerry a place as a school could well be. All day long the broad folding-doors\r\nand the two-leaved casements stood wide open: settled sunshine seemed\r\nnaturalized in the atmosphere; clouds were far off, sailing away beyond sea,\r\nresting, no doubt, round islands such as England\u2014that dear land of mists\u2014but\r\nwithdrawn wholly from the drier continent. We lived far more in the garden than\r\nunder a roof: classes were held, and meals partaken of, in the \u201cgrand berceau.\u201d\r\nMoreover, there was a note of holiday preparation, which almost turned freedom\r\ninto licence. The autumnal long vacation was but two months distant; but before\r\nthat, a great day\u2014an important ceremony\u2014none other than the f\u00eate of\r\nMadame\u2014awaited celebration.\r\n\n\r\nThe conduct of this f\u00eate devolved chiefly on Mademoiselle St. Pierre: Madame\r\nherself being supposed to stand aloof, disinterestedly unconscious of what\r\nmight be going forward in her honour. Especially, she never knew, never in the\r\nleast suspected, that a subscription was annually levied on the whole school\r\nfor the purchase of a handsome present. The polite tact of the reader will\r\nplease to leave out of the account a brief, secret consultation on this point\r\nin Madame\u2019s own chamber.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you have this year?\u201d was asked by her Parisian lieutenant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no matter! Let it alone. Let the poor children keep their francs,\u201d And\r\nMadame looked benign and modest.\r\n\n\r\nThe St. Pierre would here protrude her chin; she knew Madame by heart; she\r\nalways called her airs of \u201cbont\u00e9\u201d\u2014\u201cdes grimaces.\u201d She never even professed to\r\nrespect them one instant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVite!\u201d she would say coldly. \u201cName the article. Shall it be jewellery or\r\nporcelain, haberdashery or silver?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien! Deux ou trois cuillers, et autant de fourchettes en argent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the result was a handsome case, containing 300 francs worth of plate.\r\n\n\r\nThe programme of the f\u00eate-day\u2019s proceedings comprised: Presentation of plate,\r\ncollation in the garden, dramatic performance (with pupils and teachers for\r\nactors), a dance and supper. Very gorgeous seemed the effect of the whole to\r\nme, as I well remember. Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre understood these things and managed\r\nthem ably.\r\n\n\r\nThe play was the main point; a month\u2019s previous drilling being there required.\r\nThe choice, too, of the actors required knowledge and care; then came lessons\r\nin elocution, in attitude, and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals. For\r\nall this, as may well be supposed, St. Pierre did not suffice: other\r\nmanagement, other accomplishments than hers were requisite here. They were\r\nsupplied in the person of a master\u2014M. Paul Emanuel, professor of literature. It\r\nwas never my lot to be present at the histrionic lessons of M. Paul, but I\r\noften saw him as he crossed the carr\u00e9 (a square hall between the\r\ndwelling-house and school-house). I heard him, too, in the warm evenings,\r\nlecturing with open doors, and his name, with anecdotes of him, resounded in\r\nones ears from all sides. Especially our former acquaintance, Miss Ginevra\r\nFanshawe,\u2014who had been selected to take a prominent part in the play\u2014used, in\r\nbestowing upon me a large portion of her leisure, to lard her discourse with\r\nfrequent allusions to his sayings and doings. She esteemed him hideously plain,\r\nand used to profess herself frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of\r\nhis step or voice. A dark little man he certainly was; pungent and austere.\r\nEven to me he seemed a harsh apparition, with his close-shorn, black head, his\r\nbroad, sallow brow, his thin cheek, his wide and quivering nostril, his\r\nthorough glance, and hurried bearing. Irritable he was; one heard that, as he\r\napostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders. Sometimes he\r\nwould break out on these raw amateur actresses with a passion of impatience at\r\ntheir falseness of conception, their coldness of emotion, their feebleness of\r\ndelivery. \u201cEcoutez!\u201d he would cry; and then his voice rang through the premises\r\nlike a trumpet; and when, mimicking it, came the small pipe of a Ginevra, a\r\nMathilde, or a Blanche, one understood why a hollow groan of scorn, or a fierce\r\nhiss of rage, rewarded the tame echo.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous n\u2019\u00eates donc que des poup\u00e9es,\u201d I heard him thunder. \u201cVous n\u2019avez pas de\r\npassions\u2014vous autres. Vous ne sentez donc rien? Votre chair est de neige, votre\r\nsang de glace! Moi, je veux que tout cela s\u2019allume, qu\u2019il ait une vie, une\r\n\u00e2me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nVain resolve! And when he at last found it was vain, he suddenly broke\r\nthe whole business down. Hitherto he had been teaching them a grand tragedy; he\r\ntore the tragedy in morsels, and came next day with a compact little comic\r\ntrifle. To this they took more kindly; he presently knocked it all into their\r\nsmooth round pates.\r\n\n\r\nMademoiselle St. Pierre always presided at M. Emanuel\u2019s lessons, and I was told\r\nthat the polish of her manner, her seeming attention, her tact and grace,\r\nimpressed that gentleman very favourably. She had, indeed, the art of pleasing,\r\nfor a given time, whom she would; but the feeling would not last: in an hour it\r\nwas dried like dew, vanished like gossamer.\r\n\n\r\nThe day preceding Madame\u2019s f\u00eate was as much a holiday as the f\u00eate itself. It\r\nwas devoted to clearing out, cleaning, arranging and decorating the three\r\nschoolrooms. All within-doors was the gayest bustle; neither up-stairs nor down\r\ncould a quiet, isolated person find rest for the sole of her foot; accordingly,\r\nfor my part, I took refuge in the garden. The whole day did I wander or sit\r\nthere alone, finding warmth in the sun, shelter among the trees, and a sort of\r\ncompanionship in my own thoughts. I well remember that I exchanged but two\r\nsentences that day with any living being: not that I felt solitary; I was glad\r\nto be quiet. For a looker-on, it sufficed to pass through the rooms once or\r\ntwice, observe what changes were being wrought, how a green-room and a\r\ndressing-room were being contrived, a little stage with scenery erected, how M.\r\nPaul Emanuel, in conjunction with Mademoiselle St. Pierre, was directing all,\r\nand how an eager band of pupils, amongst them Ginevra Fanshawe, were working\r\ngaily under his control.\r\n\n\r\nThe great day arrived. The sun rose hot and unclouded, and hot and unclouded it\r\nburned on till evening. All the doors and all the windows were set open, which\r\ngave a pleasant sense of summer freedom\u2014and freedom the most complete seemed\r\nindeed the order of the day. Teachers and pupils descended to breakfast in\r\ndressing-gowns and curl-papers: anticipating \u201cavec d\u00e9lices\u201d the toilette of the\r\nevening, they seemed to take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon in a luxury\r\nof slovenliness; like aldermen fasting in preparation for a feast. About nine\r\no\u2019clock A.M., an important functionary, the \u201ccoiffeur,\u201d arrived. Sacrilegious\r\nto state, he fixed his head-quarters in the oratory, and there, in presence of\r\nb\u00e9nitier, candle, and crucifix, solemnised the mysteries of his art.\r\nEach girl was summoned in turn to pass through his hands; emerging from them\r\nwith head as smooth as a shell, intersected by faultless white lines, and\r\nwreathed about with Grecian plaits that shone as if lacquered. I took my turn\r\nwith the rest, and could hardly believe what the glass said when I applied to\r\nit for information afterwards; the lavished garlandry of woven brown hair\r\namazed me\u2014I feared it was not all my own, and it required several convincing\r\npulls to give assurance to the contrary. I then acknowledged in the coiffeur a\r\nfirst-rate artist\u2014one who certainly made the most of indifferent materials.\r\n\n\r\nThe oratory closed, the dormitory became the scene of ablutions, arrayings and\r\nbedizenings curiously elaborate. To me it was, and ever must be an enigma, how\r\nthey contrived to spend so much time in doing so little. The operation seemed\r\nclose, intricate, prolonged: the result simple. A clear white muslin dress, a\r\nblue sash (the Virgin\u2019s colours), a pair of white, or straw-colour kid\r\ngloves\u2014such was the gala uniform, to the assumption whereof that houseful of\r\nteachers and pupils devoted three mortal hours. But though simple, it must be\r\nallowed the array was perfect\u2014perfect in fashion, fit, and freshness; every\r\nhead being also dressed with exquisite nicety, and a certain compact\r\ntaste\u2014suiting the full, firm comeliness of Labassecourien contours, though too\r\nstiff for any more flowing and flexible style of beauty\u2014the general effect was,\r\non the whole, commendable.\r\n\n\r\nIn beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass, I well remember feeling myself to\r\nbe a mere shadowy spot on a field of light; the courage was not in me to put on\r\na transparent white dress: something thin I must wear\u2014the weather and rooms\r\nbeing too hot to give substantial fabrics sufferance, so I had sought through a\r\ndozen shops till I lit upon a crape-like material of purple-gray\u2014the colour, in\r\nshort, of dun mist, lying on a moor in bloom. My tailleuse had kindly\r\nmade it as well as she could: because, as she judiciously observed, it was \u201csi\r\ntriste\u2014si pen voyant,\u201d care in the fashion was the more imperative: it was well\r\nshe took this view of the matter, for I, had no flower, no jewel to relieve it:\r\nand, what was more, I had no natural rose of complexion.\r\n\n\r\nWe become oblivious of these deficiencies in the uniform routine of daily\r\ndrudgery, but they will force upon us their unwelcome blank on those\r\nbright occasions when beauty should shine.\r\n\n\r\nHowever, in this same gown of shadow, I felt at home and at ease; an advantage\r\nI should not have enjoyed in anything more brilliant or striking. Madame Beck,\r\ntoo, kept me in countenance; her dress was almost as quiet as mine, except that\r\nshe wore a bracelet, and a large brooch bright with gold and fine stones. We\r\nchanced to meet on the stairs, and she gave me a nod and smile of approbation.\r\nNot that she thought I was looking well\u2014a point unlikely to engage her\r\ninterest\u2014but she considered me dressed \u201cconvenablement,\u201d \u201cd\u00e9cemment,\u201d and la\r\nConvenance et la D\u00e9cence were the two calm deities of Madame\u2019s worship. She\r\neven paused, laid on my shoulder her gloved hand, holding an embroidered and\r\nperfumed handkerchief, and confided to my ear a sarcasm on the other teachers\r\n(whom she had just been complimenting to their faces). \u201cNothing so absurd,\u201d she\r\nsaid, \u201cas for des femmes m\u00fbres \u2018to dress themselves like girls of\r\nfifteen\u2019\u2014quant \u00e0 la St. Pierre, elle a l\u2019air d\u2019une vieille coquette qui fait\r\nl\u2019ing\u00e9nue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBeing dressed at least a couple of hours before anybody else, I felt a pleasure\r\nin betaking myself\u2014not to the garden, where servants were busy propping up long\r\ntables, placing seats, and spreading cloths in readiness for the collation but\r\nto the schoolrooms, now empty, quiet, cool, and clean; their walls fresh\r\nstained, their planked floors fresh scoured and scarce dry; flowers fresh\r\ngathered adorning the recesses in pots, and draperies, fresh hung, beautifying\r\nthe great windows.\r\n\n\r\nWithdrawing to the first classe, a smaller and neater room than the others, and\r\ntaking from the glazed bookcase, of which I kept the key, a volume whose title\r\npromised some interest, I sat down to read. The glass-door of this \u201cclasse,\u201d or\r\nschoolroom, opened into the large berceau; acacia-boughs caressed its panes, as\r\nthey stretched across to meet a rose-bush blooming by the opposite lintel: in\r\nthis rose-bush bees murmured busy and happy. I commenced reading. Just as the\r\nstilly hum, the embowering shade, the warm, lonely calm of my retreat were\r\nbeginning to steal meaning from the page, vision from my eyes, and to lure me\r\nalong the track of reverie, down into some deep dell of dreamland\u2014just then,\r\nthe sharpest ring of the street-door bell to which that much-tried instrument\r\nhad ever thrilled, snatched me back to consciousness.\r\n\n\r\nNow the bell had been ringing all the morning, as workmen, or servants, or\r\ncoiffeurs, or tailleuses, went and came on their several errands.\r\nMoreover, there was good reason to expect it would ring all the afternoon,\r\nsince about one hundred externes were yet to arrive in carriages or fiacres:\r\nnor could it be expected to rest during the evening, when parents and friends\r\nwould gather thronging to the play. Under these circumstances, a ring\u2014even a\r\nsharp ring\u2014was a matter of course: yet this particular peal had an accent of\r\nits own, which chased my dream, and startled my book from my knee.\r\n\n\r\nI was stooping to pick up this last, when\u2014firm, fast, straight\u2014right on through\r\nvestibule\u2014along corridor, across carr\u00e9, through first division, second\r\ndivision, grand salle\u2014strode a step, quick, regular, intent. The closed door of\r\nthe first classe\u2014my sanctuary\u2014offered no obstacle; it burst open, and a palet\u00f4t\r\nand a bonnet grec filled the void; also two eyes first vaguely struck upon, and\r\nthen hungrily dived into me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est cela!\u201d said a voice. \u201cJe la connais: c\u2019est l\u2019Anglaise. Tant pis. Toute\r\nAnglaise, et, par cons\u00e9quent, toute b\u00e9gueule qu\u2019elle soit\u2014elle fera mon\r\naffaire, ou je saurai pourquoi.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen, with a certain stern politeness (I suppose he thought I had not caught\r\nthe drift of his previous uncivil mutterings), and in a jargon the most\r\nexecrable that ever was heard, \u201cMeess\u2014\u2014, play you must: I am planted there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, M. Paul Emanuel?\u201d I inquired: for M. Paul Emanuel it\r\nwas, and in a state of no little excitement.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlay you must. I will not have you shrink, or frown, or make the prude. I read\r\nyour skull that night you came; I see your moyens: play you can; play you\r\nmust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how, M. Paul? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no time to be lost,\u201d he went on, now speaking in French; \u201cand let us\r\nthrust to the wall all reluctance, all excuses, all minauderies. You must take\r\na part.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the vaudeville?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the vaudeville. You have said it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI gasped, horror-struck. What did the little man mean?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d he said. \u201cThe case shall be stated, and you shall then answer me Yes,\r\nor No; and according to your answer shall I ever after estimate you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe scarce-suppressed impetus of a most irritable nature glowed in his cheek,\r\nfed with sharp shafts his glances, a nature\u2014the injudicious, the mawkish, the\r\nhesitating, the sullen, the affected, above all, the unyielding, might quickly\r\nrender violent and implacable. Silence and attention was the best balm to\r\napply: I listened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe whole matter is going to fail,\u201d he began. \u201cLouise Vanderkelkov has fallen\r\nill\u2014at least so her ridiculous mother asserts; for my part, I feel sure she\r\nmight play if she would: it is only good-will that lacks. She was charged with\r\na r\u00f4le, as you know, or do not know\u2014it is equal: without that\r\nr\u00f4le the play is stopped. There are now but a few hours in which to\r\nlearn it: not a girl in this school would hear reason, and accept the task.\r\nForsooth, it is not an interesting, not an amiable, part; their vile\r\namour-propre\u2014that base quality of which women have so much\u2014would revolt\r\nfrom it. Englishwomen are either the best or the worst of their sex. Dieu sait\r\nque je les d\u00e9teste comme la peste, ordinairement\u201d (this between his recreant\r\nteeth). \u201cI apply to an Englishwoman to rescue me. What is her answer\u2014Yes, or\r\nNo?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA thousand objections rushed into my mind. The foreign language, the limited\r\ntime, the public display\u2026 Inclination recoiled, Ability faltered, Self-respect\r\n(that \u201cvile quality\u201d) trembled. \u201cNon, non, non!\u201d said all these; but looking up\r\nat M. Paul, and seeing in his vexed, fiery, and searching eye, a sort of appeal\r\nbehind all its menace, my lips dropped the word \u201coui\u201d. For a moment his rigid\r\ncountenance relaxed with a quiver of content: quickly bent up again, however,\r\nhe went on,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVite \u00e0 l\u2019ouvrage! Here is the book; here is your r\u00f4le: read.\u201d And I\r\nread. He did not commend; at some passages he scowled and stamped. He gave me a\r\nlesson: I diligently imitated. It was a disagreeable part\u2014a man\u2019s\u2014an\r\nempty-headed fop\u2019s. One could put into it neither heart nor soul: I hated it.\r\nThe play\u2014a mere trifle\u2014ran chiefly on the efforts of a brace of rivals to gain\r\nthe hand of a fair coquette. One lover was called the \u201cOurs,\u201d a good and\r\ngallant but unpolished man, a sort of diamond in the rough; the other was a\r\nbutterfly, a talker, and a traitor: and I was to be the butterfly, talker, and\r\ntraitor.\r\n\n\r\nI did my best\u2014which was bad, I know: it provoked M. Paul; he fumed. Putting\r\nboth hands to the work, I endeavoured to do better than my best; I presume he\r\ngave me credit for good intentions; he professed to be partially content. \u201cCa\r\nira!\u201d he cried; and as voices began sounding from the garden, and white dresses\r\nfluttering among the trees, he added: \u201cYou must withdraw: you must be alone to\r\nlearn this. Come with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout being allowed time or power to deliberate, I found myself in the same\r\nbreath convoyed along as in a species of whirlwind, up-stairs, up two pair of\r\nstairs, nay, actually up three (for this fiery little man seemed as by instinct\r\nto know his way everywhere); to the solitary and lofty attic was I borne, put\r\nin and locked in, the key being, in the door, and that key he took with him and\r\nvanished.\r\n\n\r\nThe attic was no pleasant place: I believe he did not know how unpleasant it\r\nwas, or he never would have locked me in with so little ceremony. In this\r\nsummer weather, it was hot as Africa; as in winter, it was always cold as\r\nGreenland. Boxes and lumber filled it; old dresses draped its unstained\r\nwall\u2014cobwebs its unswept ceiling. Well was it known to be tenanted by rats, by\r\nblack beetles, and by cockroaches\u2014nay, rumour affirmed that the ghostly Nun of\r\nthe garden had once been seen here. A partial darkness obscured one end, across\r\nwhich, as for deeper mystery, an old russet curtain was drawn, by way of screen\r\nto a sombre band of winter cloaks, pendent each from its pin, like a malefactor\r\nfrom his gibbet. From amongst these cloaks, and behind that curtain, the Nun\r\nwas said to issue. I did not believe this, nor was I troubled by apprehension\r\nthereof; but I saw a very dark and large rat, with a long tail, come gliding\r\nout from that squalid alcove; and, moreover, my eye fell on many a\r\nblack-beetle, dotting the floor. These objects discomposed me more, perhaps,\r\nthan it would be wise to say, as also did the dust, lumber, and stifling heat\r\nof the place. The last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable, had I\r\nnot found means to open and prop up the skylight, thus admitting some\r\nfreshness. Underneath this aperture I pushed a large empty chest, and having\r\nmounted upon it a smaller box, and wiped from both the dust, I gathered my\r\ndress (my best, the reader must remember, and therefore a legitimate object of\r\ncare) fastidiously around me, ascended this species of extempore throne, and\r\nbeing seated, commenced the acquisition of my task; while I learned, not\r\nforgetting to keep a sharp look-out on the black-beetles and cockroaches, of\r\nwhich, more even, I believe, than of the rats, I sat in mortal dread.\r\n\n\r\nMy impression at first was that I had undertaken what it really was impossible\r\nto perform, and I simply resolved to do my best and be resigned to fail. I soon\r\nfound, however, that one part in so short a piece was not more than memory\r\ncould master at a few hours\u2019 notice. I learned and learned on, first in a\r\nwhisper, and then aloud. Perfectly secure from human audience, I acted my part\r\nbefore the garret-vermin. Entering into its emptiness, frivolity, and\r\nfalsehood, with a spirit inspired by scorn and impatience, I took my revenge on\r\nthis \u201cfat,\u201d by making him as fatuitous as I possibly could.\r\n\n\r\nIn this exercise the afternoon passed: day began to glide into evening; and I,\r\nwho had eaten nothing since breakfast, grew excessively hungry. Now I thought\r\nof the collation, which doubtless they were just then devouring in the garden\r\nfar below. (I had seen in the vestibule a basketful of small p\u00e2t\u00e9s \u00e0 la\r\ncr\u00eame, than which nothing in the whole range of cookery seemed to me\r\nbetter). A p\u00e2t\u00e9, or a square of cake, it seemed to me would come very\r\n\u00e0propos; and as my relish for those dainties increased, it began to\r\nappear somewhat hard that I should pass my holiday, fasting and in prison.\r\nRemote as was the attic from the street-door and vestibule, yet the\r\never-tinkling bell was faintly audible here; and also the ceaseless roll of\r\nwheels, on the tormented pavement. I knew that the house and garden were\r\nthronged, and that all was gay and glad below; here it began to grow dusk: the\r\nbeetles were fading from my sight; I trembled lest they should steal on me a\r\nmarch, mount my throne unseen, and, unsuspected, invade my skirts. Impatient\r\nand apprehensive, I recommenced the rehearsal of my part merely to kill time.\r\nJust as I was concluding, the long-delayed rattle of the key in the lock came\r\nto my ear\u2014no unwelcome sound. M. Paul (I could just see through the dusk that\r\nit was M. Paul, for light enough still lingered to show the velvet\r\nblackness of his close-shorn head, and the sallow ivory of his brow) looked in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBrava!\u201d cried he, holding the door open and remaining at the threshold. \u201cJ\u2019ai\r\ntout entendu. C\u2019est assez bien. Encore!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA moment I hesitated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEncore!\u201d said he sternly. \u201cEt point de grimaces! A bas la timidit\u00e9!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I went through the part, but not half so well as I had spoken it alone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEnfin, elle sait,\u201d said he, half dissatisfied, \u201cand one cannot be fastidious\r\nor exacting under the circumstances.\u201d Then he added, \u201cYou may yet have twenty\r\nminutes for preparation: au revoir!\u201d And he was going.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d I called out, taking courage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEh bien! Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est, Mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019ai bien faim.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComment, vous avez faim! Et la collation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing about it. I have not seen it, shut up here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! C\u2019est vrai,\u201d cried he.\r\n\n\r\nIn a moment my throne was abdicated, the attic evacuated; an inverse repetition\r\nof the impetus which had brought me up into the attic, instantly took me\r\ndown\u2014down\u2014down to the very kitchen. I thought I should have gone to the cellar.\r\nThe cook was imperatively ordered to produce food, and I, as imperatively, was\r\ncommanded to eat. To my great joy this food was limited to coffee and cake: I\r\nhad feared wine and sweets, which I did not like. How he guessed that I should\r\nlike a petit p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00eame I cannot tell; but he went out and procured\r\nme one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and drank,\r\nkeeping the petit p\u00e2t\u00e9 till the last, as a bonne bouche. M. Paul\r\nsuperintended my repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could swallow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA la bonne heure,\u201d he cried, when I signified that I really could take no\r\nmore, and, with uplifted hands, implored to be spared the additional roll on\r\nwhich he had just spread butter. \u201cYou will set me down as a species of tyrant\r\nand Bluebeard, starving women in a garret; whereas, after all, I am no such\r\nthing. Now, Mademoiselle, do you feel courage and strength to appear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, I thought I did; though, in truth, I was perfectly confused, and could\r\nhardly tell how I felt: but this little man was of the order of beings who must\r\nnot be opposed, unless you possessed an all-dominant force sufficient to crush\r\nhim at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome then,\u201d said he, offering his hand.\r\n\n\r\nI gave him mine, and he set off with a rapid walk, which obliged me to run at\r\nhis side in order to keep pace. In the carr\u00e9 he stopped a moment: it was lit\r\nwith large lamps; the wide doors of the classes were open, and so were the\r\nequally wide garden-doors; orange-trees in tubs, and tall flowers in pots,\r\nornamented these portals on each side; groups of ladies and gentlemen in\r\nevening-dress stood and walked amongst the flowers. Within, the long vista of\r\nthe school-rooms presented a thronging, undulating, murmuring, waving,\r\nstreaming multitude, all rose, and blue, and half translucent white. There were\r\nlustres burning overhead; far off there was a stage, a solemn green curtain, a\r\nrow of footlights.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cN\u2019est-ce pas que c\u2019est beau?\u201d demanded my companion.\r\n\n\r\nI should have said it was, but my heart got up into my throat. M. Paul\r\ndiscovered this, and gave me a side-scowl and a little shake for my pains.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will do my best, but I wish it was over,\u201d said I; then I asked: \u201cAre we to\r\nwalk through that crowd?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means: I manage matters better: we pass through the garden\u2014here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn an instant we were out of doors: the cool, calm night revived me somewhat.\r\nIt was moonless, but the reflex from the many glowing windows lit the court\r\nbrightly, and even the alleys\u2014dimly. Heaven was cloudless, and grand with the\r\nquiver of its living fires. How soft are the nights of the Continent! How\r\nbland, balmy, safe! No sea-fog; no chilling damp: mistless as noon, and fresh\r\nas morning.\r\n\n\r\nHaving crossed court and garden, we reached the glass door of the first classe.\r\nIt stood open, like all other doors that night; we passed, and then I was\r\nushered into a small cabinet, dividing the first classe from the grand salle.\r\nThis cabinet dazzled me, it was so full of light: it deafened me, it was\r\nclamorous with voices: it stifled me, it was so hot, choking, thronged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDe l\u2019ordre! Du silence!\u201d cried M. Paul. \u201cIs this chaos?\u201d, he demanded; and\r\nthere was a hush. With a dozen words, and as many gestures, he turned out half\r\nthe persons present, and obliged the remnant to fall into rank. Those left were\r\nall in costume: they were the performers, and this was the green-room. M. Paul\r\nintroduced me. All stared and some tittered. It was a surprise: they had not\r\nexpected the Englishwoman would play in a vaudeville. Ginevra Fanshawe,\r\nbeautifully dressed for her part, and looking fascinatingly pretty, turned on\r\nme a pair of eyes as round as beads. In the highest spirit, unperturbed by fear\r\nor bashfulness, delighted indeed at the thought of shining off before\r\nhundreds\u2014my entrance seemed to transfix her with amazement in the midst of her\r\njoy. She would have exclaimed, but M. Paul held her and all the rest in check.\r\n\n\r\nHaving surveyed and criticized the whole troop, he turned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, too, must be dressed for your part.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDressed\u2014dressed like a man!\u201d exclaimed Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, darting forwards;\r\nadding with officiousness, \u201cI will dress her myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo be dressed like a man did not please, and would not suit me. I had consented\r\nto take a man\u2019s name and part; as to his dress\u2014halte l\u00e0! No. I would\r\nkeep my own dress, come what might. M. Paul might storm, might rage: I would\r\nkeep my own dress. I said so, with a voice as resolute in intent, as it was\r\nlow, and perhaps unsteady in utterance.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not immediately storm or rage, as I fully thought he would he stood\r\nsilent. But Z\u00e9lie again interposed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe will make a capital petit-m\u00e2itre. Here are the garments, all\u2014all\r\ncomplete: somewhat too large, but\u2014I will arrange all that. Come, ch\u00e8re\r\namie\u2014belle Anglaise!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she sneered, for I was not \u201cbelle.\u201d She seized my hand, she was drawing me\r\naway. M. Paul stood impassable\u2014neutral.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must not resist,\u201d pursued St. Pierre\u2014for resist I did. \u201cYou will spoil\r\nall, destroy the mirth of the piece, the enjoyment of the company, sacrifice\r\neverything to your amour-propre. This would be too bad\u2014monsieur will\r\nnever permit this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe sought his eye. I watched, likewise, for a glance. He gave her one, and\r\nthen he gave me one. \u201cStop!\u201d he said slowly, arresting St. Pierre, who\r\ncontinued her efforts to drag me after her. Everybody awaited the decision. He\r\nwas not angry, not irritated; I perceived that, and took heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not like these clothes?\u201d he asked, pointing to the masculine vestments.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t object to some of them, but I won\u2019t have them all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow must it be, then? How accept a man\u2019s part, and go on the stage dressed as\r\na woman? This is an amateur affair, it is true\u2014a vaudeville de\r\npensionnat; certain modifications I might sanction, yet something you must\r\nhave to announce you as of the nobler sex.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I will, Monsieur; but it must be arranged in my own way: nobody must\r\nmeddle; the things must not be forced upon me. Just let me dress myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMonsieur, without another word, took the costume from St. Pierre, gave it to\r\nme, and permitted me to pass into the dressing-room. Once alone, I grew calm,\r\nand collectedly went to work. Retaining my woman\u2019s garb without the slightest\r\nretrenchment, I merely assumed, in addition, a little vest, a collar, and\r\ncravat, and a palet\u00f4t of small dimensions; the whole being the costume of a\r\nbrother of one of the pupils. Having loosened my hair out of its braids, made\r\nup the long back-hair close, and brushed the front hair to one side, I took my\r\nhat and gloves in my hand and came out. M. Paul was waiting, and so were the\r\nothers. He looked at me. \u201cThat may pass in a pensionnat,\u201d he pronounced. Then\r\nadded, not unkindly, \u201cCourage, mon ami! Un peu de sangfroid\u2014un peu d\u2019aplomb, M.\r\nLucien, et tout ira bien.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSt. Pierre sneered again, in her cold snaky manner.\r\n\n\r\nI was irritable, because excited, and I could not help turning upon her and\r\nsaying, that if she were not a lady and I a gentleman, I should feel disposed\r\nto call her out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfter the play, after the play,\u201d said M. Paul. \u201cI will then divide my pair of\r\npistols between you, and we will settle the dispute according to form: it will\r\nonly be the old quarrel of France and England.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut now the moment approached for the performance to commence. M. Paul, setting\r\nus before him, harangued us briefly, like a general addressing soldiers about\r\nto charge. I don\u2019t know what he said, except that he recommended each to\r\npenetrate herself with a sense of her personal insignificance. God knows I\r\nthought this advice superfluous for some of us. A bell tinkled. I and two more\r\nwere ushered on to the stage. The bell tinkled again. I had to speak the very\r\nfirst words.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not look at the crowd, nor think of it,\u201d whispered M. Paul in my ear.\r\n\u201cImagine yourself in the garret, acting to the rats.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe vanished. The curtain drew up\u2014shrivelled to the ceiling: the bright lights,\r\nthe long room, the gay throng, burst upon us. I thought of the black-beetles,\r\nthe old boxes, the worm-eaten bureau. I said my say badly; but I said it. That\r\nfirst speech was the difficulty; it revealed to me this fact, that it was not\r\nthe crowd I feared so much as my own voice. Foreigners and strangers, the crowd\r\nwere nothing to me. Nor did I think of them. When my tongue once got free, and\r\nmy voice took its true pitch, and found its natural tone, I thought of nothing\r\nbut the personage I represented\u2014and of M. Paul, who was listening, watching,\r\nprompting in the side-scenes.\r\n\n\r\nBy-and-by, feeling the right power come\u2014the spring demanded gush and rise\r\ninwardly\u2014I became sufficiently composed to notice my fellow-actors. Some of\r\nthem played very well; especially Ginevra Fanshawe, who had to coquette between\r\ntwo suitors, and managed admirably: in fact she was in her element. I observed\r\nthat she once or twice threw a certain marked fondness and pointed partiality\r\ninto her manner towards me\u2014the fop. With such emphasis and animation did she\r\nfavour me, such glances did she dart out into the listening and applauding\r\ncrowd, that to me\u2014who knew her\u2014it presently became evident she was acting\r\nat some one; and I followed her eye, her smile, her gesture, and ere\r\nlong discovered that she had at least singled out a handsome and distinguished\r\naim for her shafts; full in the path of those arrows\u2014taller than other\r\nspectators, and therefore more sure to receive them\u2014stood, in attitude quiet\r\nbut intent, a well-known form\u2014that of Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\nThe spectacle seemed somehow suggestive. There was language in Dr. John\u2019s look,\r\nthough I cannot tell what he said; it animated me: I drew out of it a history;\r\nI put my idea into the part I performed; I threw it into my wooing of Ginevra.\r\nIn the \u201cOurs,\u201d or sincere lover, I saw Dr. John. Did I pity him, as erst? No, I\r\nhardened my heart, rivalled and out-rivalled him. I knew myself but a fop, but\r\nwhere he was outcast I could please. Now I know I acted as if\r\nwishful and resolute to win and conquer. Ginevra seconded me; between us we\r\nhalf-changed the nature of the r\u00f4le, gilding it from top to toe. Between\r\nthe acts M. Paul, told us he knew not what possessed us, and half expostulated.\r\n\u201cC\u2019est peut-\u00eatre plus beau que votre mod\u00e8le,\u201d said he, \u201cmais ce n\u2019est pas\r\njuste.\u201d I know not what possessed me either; but somehow, my longing was to\r\neclipse the \u201cOurs,\u201d i.e., Dr. John. Ginevra was tender; how could I be\r\notherwise than chivalric? Retaining the letter, I recklessly altered the spirit\r\nof the r\u00f4le. Without heart, without interest, I could not play it at\r\nall. It must be played\u2014in went the yearned-for seasoning\u2014thus favoured, I\r\nplayed it with relish.\r\n\n\r\nWhat I felt that night, and what I did, I no more expected to feel and do, than\r\nto be lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven. Cold, reluctant, apprehensive,\r\nI had accepted a part to please another: ere long, warming, becoming\r\ninterested, taking courage, I acted to please myself. Yet the next day, when I\r\nthought it over, I quite disapproved of these amateur performances; and though\r\nglad that I had obliged M. Paul, and tried my own strength for once, I took a\r\nfirm resolution, never to be drawn into a similar affair. A keen relish for\r\ndramatic expression had revealed itself as part of my nature; to cherish and\r\nexercise this new-found faculty might gift me with a world of delight, but it\r\nwould not do for a mere looker-on at life: the strength and longing must be put\r\nby; and I put them by, and fastened them in with the lock of a resolution which\r\nneither Time nor Temptation has since picked.\r\n\n\r\nNo sooner was the play over, and well over, than the choleric and\r\narbitrary M. Paul underwent a metamorphosis. His hour of managerial\r\nresponsibility past, he at once laid aside his magisterial austerity; in a\r\nmoment he stood amongst us, vivacious, kind, and social, shook hands with us\r\nall round, thanked us separately, and announced his determination that each of\r\nus should in turn be his partner in the coming ball. On his claiming my\r\npromise, I told him I did not dance. \u201cFor once I must,\u201d was the answer; and if\r\nI had not slipped aside and kept out of his way, he would have compelled me to\r\nthis second performance. But I had acted enough for one evening; it was time I\r\nretired into myself and my ordinary life. My dun-coloured dress did well enough\r\nunder a palet\u00f4t on the stage, but would not suit a waltz or a quadrille.\r\nWithdrawing to a quiet nook, whence unobserved I could observe\u2014the ball, its\r\nsplendours and its pleasures, passed before me as a spectacle.\r\n\n\r\nAgain Ginevra Fanshawe was the belle, the fairest and the gayest present; she\r\nwas selected to open the ball: very lovely she looked, very gracefully she\r\ndanced, very joyously she smiled. Such scenes were her triumphs\u2014she was the\r\nchild of pleasure. Work or suffering found her listless and dejected, powerless\r\nand repining; but gaiety expanded her butterfly\u2019s wings, lit up their gold-dust\r\nand bright spots, made her flash like a gem, and flush like a flower. At all\r\nordinary diet and plain beverage she would pout; but she fed on creams and ices\r\nlike a humming-bird on honey-paste: sweet wine was her element, and sweet cake\r\nher daily bread. Ginevra lived her full life in a ball-room; elsewhere she\r\ndrooped dispirited.\r\n\n\r\nThink not, reader, that she thus bloomed and sparkled for the mere sake of M.\r\nPaul, her partner, or that she lavished her best graces that night for the\r\nedification of her companions only, or for that of the parents and\r\ngrand-parents, who filled the carr\u00e9, and lined the ball-room; under\r\ncircumstances so insipid and limited, with motives so chilly and vapid, Ginevra\r\nwould scarce have deigned to walk one quadrille, and weariness and fretfulness\r\nwould have replaced animation and good-humour, but she knew of a leaven in the\r\notherwise heavy festal mass which lighted the whole; she tasted a condiment\r\nwhich gave it zest; she perceived reasons justifying the display of her\r\nchoicest attractions.\r\n\n\r\nIn the ball-room, indeed, not a single male spectator was to be seen who was\r\nnot married and a father\u2014M. Paul excepted\u2014that gentleman, too, being the sole\r\ncreature of his sex permitted to lead out a pupil to the dance; and this\r\nexceptional part was allowed him, partly as a matter of old-established custom\r\n(for he was a kinsman of Madame Beck\u2019s, and high in her confidence), partly\r\nbecause he would always have his own way and do as he pleased, and partly\r\nbecause\u2014wilful, passionate, partial, as he might be\u2014he was the soul of honour,\r\nand might be trusted with a regiment of the fairest and purest; in perfect\r\nsecurity that under his leadership they would come to no harm. Many of the\r\ngirls\u2014it may be noted in parenthesis\u2014were not pure-minded at all, very much\r\notherwise; but they no more dare betray their natural coarseness in M. Paul\u2019s\r\npresence, than they dare tread purposely on his corns, laugh in his face during\r\na stormy apostrophe, or speak above their breath while some crisis of\r\nirritability was covering his human visage with the mask of an intelligent\r\ntiger. M. Paul, then, might dance with whom he would\u2014and woe be to the\r\ninterference which put him out of step.\r\n\n\r\nOthers there were admitted as spectators\u2014with (seeming) reluctance, through\r\nprayers, by influence, under restriction, by special and difficult exercise of\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s gracious good-nature, and whom she all the evening\u2014with her own\r\npersonal surveillance\u2014kept far aloof at the remotest, drearest, coldest,\r\ndarkest side of the carr\u00e9\u2014a small, forlorn band of \u201cjeunes gens;\u201d these being\r\nall of the best families, grown-up sons of mothers present, and whose sisters\r\nwere pupils in the school. That whole evening was Madame on duty beside these\r\n\u201cjeunes gens\u201d\u2014attentive to them as a mother, but strict with them as a dragon.\r\nThere was a sort of cordon stretched before them, which they wearied her with\r\nprayers to be permitted to pass, and just to revive themselves by one dance\r\nwith that \u201cbelle blonde,\u201d or that \u201cjolie brune,\u201d or \u201ccette jeune fille\r\nmagnifique aux cheveux noirs comme le jais.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTaisez-vous!\u201d Madame would reply, heroically and inexorably. \u201cVous ne passerez\r\npas \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit sur mon cadavre, et vous ne danserez qu\u2019avec la\r\nnonnette du jardin\u201d (alluding to the legend). And she majestically walked to\r\nand fro along their disconsolate and impatient line, like a little Bonaparte in\r\na mouse-coloured silk gown.\r\n\n\r\nMadame knew something of the world; Madame knew much of human nature. I don\u2019t\r\nthink that another directress in Villette would have dared to admit a \u201cjeune\r\nhomme\u201d within her walls; but Madame knew that by granting such admission, on an\r\noccasion like the present, a bold stroke might be struck, and a great point\r\ngained.\r\n\n\r\nIn the first place, the parents were made accomplices to the deed, for it was\r\nonly through their mediation it was brought about. Secondly: the admission of\r\nthese rattlesnakes, so fascinating and so dangerous, served to draw out Madame\r\nprecisely in her strongest character\u2014that of a first-rate surveillante.\r\nThirdly: their presence furnished a most piquant ingredient to the\r\nentertainment: the pupils knew it, and saw it, and the view of such golden\r\napples shining afar off, animated them with a spirit no other circumstance\r\ncould have kindled. The children\u2019s pleasure spread to the parents; life and\r\nmirth circulated quickly round the ball-room; the \u201cjeunes gens\u201d themselves,\r\nthough restrained, were amused: for Madame never permitted them to feel\r\ndull\u2014and thus Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate annually ensured a success unknown to the f\u00eate\r\nof any other directress in the land.\r\n\n\r\nI observed that Dr. John was at first permitted to walk at large through the\r\nclasses: there was about him a manly, responsible look, that redeemed his\r\nyouth, and half-expiated his beauty; but as soon as the ball began, Madame ran\r\nup to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Wolf; come,\u201d said she, laughing: \u201cyou wear sheep\u2019s clothing, but you\r\nmust quit the fold notwithstanding. Come; I have a fine menagerie of twenty\r\nhere in the carr\u00e9: let me place you amongst my collection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut first suffer me to have one dance with one pupil of my choice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you the face to ask such a thing? It is madness: it is impiety. Sortez,\r\nsortez, au plus vite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe drove him before her, and soon had him enclosed within the cordon.\r\n\n\r\nGinevra being, I suppose, tired with dancing, sought me out in my retreat. She\r\nthrew herself on the bench beside me, and (a demonstration I could very well\r\nhave dispensed with) cast her arms round my neck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe! Lucy Snowe!\u201d she cried in a somewhat sobbing voice, half\r\nhysterical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the world is the matter?\u201d I drily said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do I look\u2014how do I look to-night?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs usual,\u201d said I; \u201cpreposterously vain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaustic creature! You never have a kind word for me; but in spite of you, and\r\nall other envious detractors, I know I am beautiful; I feel it, I see it\u2014for\r\nthere is a great looking-glass in the dressing-room, where I can view my shape\r\nfrom head to foot. Will you go with me now, and let us two stand before it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Fanshawe: you shall be humoured even to the top of your bent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe dressing-room was very near, and we stepped in. Putting her arm through\r\nmine, she drew me to the mirror. Without resistance remonstrance, or remark, I\r\nstood and let her self-love have its feast and triumph: curious to see how much\r\nit could swallow\u2014whether it was possible it could feed to satiety\u2014whether any\r\nwhisper of consideration for others could penetrate her heart, and moderate its\r\nvainglorious exultation.\r\n\n\r\nNot at all. She turned me and herself round; she viewed us both on all sides;\r\nshe smiled, she waved her curls, she retouched her sash, she spread her dress,\r\nand finally, letting go my arm, and curtseying with mock respect, she said: \u201cI\r\nwould not be you for a kingdom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe remark was too na\u00efve to rouse anger; I merely said: \u201cVery good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what would you give to be ME?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a bad sixpence\u2014strange as it may sound,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou are but a poor\r\ncreature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think so in your heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; for in my heart you have not the outline of a place: I only occasionally\r\nturn you over in my brain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, but,\u201d said she, in an expostulatory tone, \u201cjust listen to the difference\r\nof our positions, and then see how happy am I, and how miserable are you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo on; I listen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place: I am the daughter of a gentleman of family, and though my\r\nfather is not rich, I have expectations from an uncle. Then, I am just\r\neighteen, the finest age possible. I have had a continental education, and\r\nthough I can\u2019t spell, I have abundant accomplishments. I am pretty;\r\nyou can\u2019t deny that; I may have as many admirers as I choose. This very\r\nnight I have been breaking the hearts of two gentlemen, and it is the dying\r\nlook I had from one of them just now, which puts me in such spirits. I do so\r\nlike to watch them turn red and pale, and scowl and dart fiery glances at each\r\nother, and languishing ones at me. There is me\u2014happy ME; now for\r\nyou, poor soul!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you are nobody\u2019s daughter, since you took care of little children\r\nwhen you first came to Villette: you have no relations; you can\u2019t call yourself\r\nyoung at twenty-three; you have no attractive accomplishments\u2014no beauty. As to\r\nadmirers, you hardly know what they are; you can\u2019t even talk on the subject:\r\nyou sit dumb when the other teachers quote their conquests. I believe you never\r\nwere in love, and never will be: you don\u2019t know the feeling, and so much the\r\nbetter, for though you might have your own heart broken, no living heart will\r\nyou ever break. Isn\u2019t it all true?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA good deal of it is true as gospel, and shrewd besides. There must be good in\r\nyou, Ginevra, to speak so honestly; that snake, Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, could not\r\nutter what you have uttered. Still, Miss Fanshawe, hapless as I am, according\r\nto your showing, sixpence I would not give to purchase you, body and soul.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust because I am not clever, and that is all you think of. Nobody in\r\nthe world but you cares for cleverness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I consider you are clever, in your way\u2014very smart\r\nindeed. But you were talking of breaking hearts\u2014that edifying amusement into\r\nthe merits of which I don\u2019t quite enter; pray on whom does your vanity lead you\r\nto think you have done execution to-night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe approached her lips to my ear\u2014\u201cIsidore and Alfred de Hamal are both here,\u201d\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! they are? I should like to see them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dear creature! your curiosity is roused at last. Follow me, I will\r\npoint them out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe proudly led the way\u2014\u201cBut you cannot see them well from the classes,\u201d said\r\nshe, turning, \u201cMadame keeps them too far off. Let us cross the garden, enter by\r\nthe corridor, and get close to them behind: we shall be scolded if we are seen,\r\nbut never mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor once, I did not mind. Through the garden we went\u2014penetrated into the\r\ncorridor by a quiet private entrance, and approaching the carr\u00e9, yet\r\nkeeping in the corridor shade, commanded a near view of the band of \u201cjeunes\r\ngens.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI believe I could have picked out the conquering de Hamal even undirected. He\r\nwas a straight-nosed, very correct-featured little dandy. I say little\r\ndandy, though he was not beneath the middle standard in stature; but his\r\nlineaments were small, and so were his hands and feet; and he was pretty and\r\nsmooth, and as trim as a doll: so nicely dressed, so nicely curled, so booted\r\nand gloved and cravated\u2014he was charming indeed. I said so. \u201cWhat, a dear\r\npersonage!\u201d cried I, and commended Ginevra\u2019s taste warmly; and asked her what\r\nshe thought de Hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart\r\nshe had broken\u2014whether he kept them in a scent-vial, and conserved them in otto\r\nof roses? I observed, too, with deep rapture of approbation, that the colonel\u2019s\r\nhands were scarce larger than Miss Fanshawe\u2019s own, and suggested that this\r\ncircumstance might be convenient, as he could wear her gloves at a pinch. On\r\nhis dear curls, I told her I doated: and as to his low, Grecian brow, and\r\nexquisite classic headpiece, I confessed I had no language to do such\r\nperfections justice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if he were your lover?\u201d suggested the cruelly exultant Ginevra.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! heavens, what bliss!\u201d said I; \u201cbut do not be inhuman, Miss Fanshawe: to\r\nput such thoughts into my head is like showing poor outcast Cain a far, glimpse\r\nof Paradise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou like him, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs I like sweets, and jams, and comfits, and conservatory flowers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGinevra admired my taste, for all these things were her adoration; she could\r\nthen readily credit that they were mine too.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow for Isidore,\u201d I went on. I own I felt still more curious to see him than\r\nhis rival; but Ginevra was absorbed in the latter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlfred was admitted here to-night,\u201d said she, \u201cthrough the influence of his\r\naunt, Madame la Baronne de Dorlodot; and now, having seen him, can you not\r\nunderstand why I have been in such spirits all the evening, and acted so well,\r\nand danced with such life, and why I am now happy as a queen? Dieu! Dieu! It\r\nwas such good fun to glance first at him and then at the other, and madden them\r\nboth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut that other\u2014where is he? Show me Isidore.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause\u2014because\u201d (in a whisper) \u201che has such\u2014such whiskers, orange\u2014red\u2014there\r\nnow!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe murder is out,\u201d I subjoined. \u201cNever mind, show him all the same; I engage\r\nnot to faint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked round. Just then an English voice spoke behind her and me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are both standing in a draught; you must leave this corridor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no draught, Dr. John,\u201d said I, turning.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe takes cold so easily,\u201d he pursued, looking at Ginevra with extreme\r\nkindness. \u201cShe is delicate; she must be cared for: fetch her a shawl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to judge for myself,\u201d said Miss Fanshawe, with hauteur. \u201cI want no\r\nshawl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour dress is thin, you have been dancing, you are heated.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlways preaching,\u201d retorted she; \u201calways coddling and admonishing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe answer Dr. John would have given did not come; that his heart was hurt\r\nbecame evident in his eye; darkened, and saddened, and pained, he turned a\r\nlittle aside, but was patient. I knew where there were plenty of shawls near at\r\nhand; I ran and fetched one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe shall wear this, if I have strength to make her,\u201d said I, folding it well\r\nround her muslin dress, covering carefully her neck and her arms. \u201cIs that\r\nIsidore?\u201d I asked, in a somewhat fierce whisper.\r\n\n\r\nShe pushed up her lip, smiled, and nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that Isidore?\u201d I repeated, giving her a shake: I could have given\r\nher a dozen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cC\u2019est lui-m\u00eame,\u201d said she. \u201cHow coarse he is, compared with the Colonel-Count!\r\nAnd then\u2014oh ciel!\u2014the whiskers!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDr. John now passed on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Colonel-Count!\u201d I echoed. \u201cThe doll\u2014the puppet\u2014the manikin\u2014the poor\r\ninferior creature! A mere lackey for Dr. John his valet, his foot-boy! Is it\r\npossible that fine generous gentleman\u2014handsome as a vision\u2014offers you his\r\nhonourable hand and gallant heart, and promises to protect your flimsy person\r\nand feckless mind through the storms and struggles of life\u2014and you hang\r\nback\u2014you scorn, you sting, you torture him! Have you power to do this? Who gave\r\nyou that power? Where is it? Does it lie all in your beauty\u2014your pink and white\r\ncomplexion, and your yellow hair? Does this bind his soul at your feet, and\r\nbend his neck under your yoke? Does this purchase for you his affection, his\r\ntenderness, his thoughts, his hopes, his interest, his noble, cordial love\u2014and\r\nwill you not have it? Do you scorn it? You are only dissembling: you are not in\r\nearnest: you love him; you long for him; but you trifle with his heart to make\r\nhim more surely yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! How you run on! I don\u2019t understand half you have said.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had got her out into the garden ere this. I now set her down on a seat and\r\ntold her she should not stir till she had avowed which she meant in the end to\r\naccept\u2014the man or the monkey.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHim you call the man,\u201d said she, \u201cis bourgeois, sandy-haired, and answers to\r\nthe name of John!\u2014cela suffit: je n\u2019en veux pas. Colonel de Hamal is a\r\ngentleman of excellent connections, perfect manners, sweet appearance, with\r\npale interesting face, and hair and eyes like an Italian. Then too he is the\r\nmost delightful company possible\u2014a man quite in my way; not sensible and\r\nserious like the other; but one with whom I can talk on equal terms\u2014who does\r\nnot plague and bore, and harass me with depths, and heights, and passions, and\r\ntalents for which I have no taste. There now. Don\u2019t hold me so fast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI slackened my grasp, and she darted off. I did not care to pursue her.\r\n\n\r\nSomehow I could not avoid returning once more in the direction of the corridor\r\nto get another glimpse of Dr. John; but I met him on the garden-steps, standing\r\nwhere the light from a window fell broad. His well-proportioned figure was not\r\nto be mistaken, for I doubt whether there was another in that assemblage his\r\nequal. He carried his hat in his hand; his uncovered head, his face and fine\r\nbrow were most handsome and manly. His features were not delicate, not\r\nslight like those of a woman, nor were they cold, frivolous, and feeble; though\r\nwell cut, they were not so chiselled, so frittered away, as to lose in\r\nexpression or significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry. Much feeling\r\nspoke in them at times, and more sat silent in his eye. Such at least were my\r\nthoughts of him: to me he seemed all this. An inexpressible sense of wonder\r\noccupied me, as I looked at this man, and reflected that he could not be\r\nslighted.\r\n\n\r\nIt was, not my intention to approach or address him in the garden, our terms of\r\nacquaintance not warranting such a step; I had only meant to view him in the\r\ncrowd\u2014myself unseen: coming upon him thus alone, I withdrew. But he was looking\r\nout for me, or rather for her who had been with me: therefore he descended the\r\nsteps, and followed me down the alley.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know Miss Fanshawe? I have often wished to ask whether you knew her,\u201d said\r\nhe.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: I know her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIntimately?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite as intimately as I wish.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done with her now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I her keeper?\u201d I felt inclined to ask; but I simply answered, \u201cI have\r\nshaken her well, and would have shaken her better, but she escaped out of my\r\nhands and ran away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould you favour me,\u201d he asked, \u201cby watching over her this one evening, and\r\nobserving that she does nothing imprudent\u2014does not, for instance, run out into\r\nthe night-air immediately after dancing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI may, perhaps, look after her a little; since you wish it; but she likes her\r\nown way too well to submit readily to control.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is so young, so thoroughly artless,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo me she is an enigma,\u201d I responded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she?\u201d he asked\u2014much interested. \u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would be difficult to say how\u2014difficult, at least, to tell you how.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder she is not better pleased that you are so much her friend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut she has not the slightest idea how much I am her friend. That is\r\nprecisely the point I cannot teach her. May I inquire did she ever speak of me\r\nto you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnder the name of \u2018Isidore\u2019 she has talked about you often; but I must add\r\nthat it is only within the last ten minutes I have discovered that you and\r\n\u2018Isidore\u2019 are identical. It is only, Dr. John, within that brief space of time\r\nI have learned that Ginevra Fanshawe is the person, under this roof, in whom\r\nyou have long been interested\u2014that she is the magnet which attracts you to the\r\nRue Fossette, that for her sake you venture into this garden, and seek out\r\ncaskets dropped by rivals.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know all?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know so much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor more than a year I have been accustomed to meet her in society. Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley, her friend, is an acquaintance of mine; thus I see her every\r\nSunday. But you observed that under the name of \u2018Isidore\u2019 she often spoke of\r\nme: may I\u2014without inviting you to a breach of confidence\u2014inquire what was the\r\ntone, what the feeling of her remarks? I feel somewhat anxious to know, being a\r\nlittle tormented with uncertainty as to how I stand with her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, she varies: she shifts and changes like the wind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill, you can gather some general idea\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can,\u201d thought I, \u201cbut it would not do to communicate that general idea to\r\nyou. Besides, if I said she did not love you, I know you would not believe me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are silent,\u201d he pursued. \u201cI suppose you have no good news to impart. No\r\nmatter. If she feels for me positive coldness and aversion, it is a sign I do\r\nnot deserve her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you doubt yourself? Do you consider yourself the inferior of Colonel de\r\nHamal?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI love Miss Fanshawe far more than de Hamal loves any human being, and would\r\ncare for and guard her better than he. Respecting de Hamal, I fear she is under\r\nan illusion; the man\u2019s character is known to me, all his antecedents, all his\r\nscrapes. He is not worthy of your beautiful young friend.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy \u2018beautiful young friend\u2019 ought to know that, and to know or feel who is\r\nworthy of her,\u201d said I. \u201cIf her beauty or her brains will not serve her so far,\r\nshe merits the sharp lesson of experience.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you not a little severe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am excessively severe\u2014more severe than I choose to show you. You should hear\r\nthe strictures with which I favour my \u2018beautiful young friend,\u2019 only that you\r\nwould be unutterably shocked at my want of tender considerateness for her\r\ndelicate nature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is so lovely, one cannot but be loving towards her. You\u2014every woman older\r\nthan herself, must feel for such a simple, innocent, girlish fairy a sort of\r\nmotherly or elder-sisterly fondness. Graceful angel! Does not your heart yearn\r\ntowards her when she pours into your ear her pure, childlike confidences? How\r\nyou are privileged!\u201d And he sighed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cut short these confidences somewhat abruptly now and then,\u201d said I. \u201cBut\r\nexcuse me, Dr. John, may I change the theme for one instant? What a god-like\r\nperson is that de Hamal! What a nose on his face\u2014perfect! Model one in putty or\r\nclay, you could not make a better or straighter, or neater; and then, such\r\nclassic lips and chin\u2014and his bearing\u2014sublime.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDe Hamal is an unutterable puppy, besides being a very white-livered hero.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou, Dr. John, and every man of a less-refined mould than he, must feel for\r\nhim a sort of admiring affection, such as Mars and the coarser deities may be\r\nsupposed to have borne the young, graceful Apollo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn unprincipled, gambling little jackanapes!\u201d said Dr. John curtly, \u201cwhom,\r\nwith one hand, I could lift up by the waistband any day, and lay low in the\r\nkennel if I liked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sweet seraph!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat a cruel idea! Are you not a little severe,\r\nDr. John?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd now I paused. For the second time that night I was going beyond\r\nmyself\u2014venturing out of what I looked on as my natural habits\u2014speaking in an\r\nunpremeditated, impulsive strain, which startled me strangely when I halted to\r\nreflect. On rising that morning, had I anticipated that before night I should\r\nhave acted the part of a gay lover in a vaudeville; and an hour after, frankly\r\ndiscussed with Dr. John the question of his hapless suit, and rallied him on\r\nhis illusions? I had no more presaged such feats than I had looked forward to\r\nan ascent in a balloon, or a voyage to Cape Horn.\r\n\n\r\nThe Doctor and I, having paced down the walk, were now returning; the reflex\r\nfrom the window again lit his face: he smiled, but his eye was melancholy. How\r\nI wished that he could feel heart\u2019s-ease! How I grieved that he brooded over\r\npain, and pain from such a cause! He, with his great advantages, he to\r\nlove in vain! I did not then know that the pensiveness of reverse is the best\r\nphase for some minds; nor did I reflect that some herbs, \u201cthough scentless when\r\nentire, yield fragrance when they\u2019re bruised.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not be sorrowful, do not grieve,\u201d I broke out. \u201cIf there is in Ginevra one\r\nspark of worthiness of your affection, she will\u2014she must feel devotion\r\nin return. Be cheerful, be hopeful, Dr. John. Who should hope, if not you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn return for this speech I got\u2014what, it must be supposed, I deserved\u2014a look of\r\nsurprise: I thought also of some disapprobation. We parted, and I went into the\r\nhouse very chill. The clocks struck and the bells tolled midnight; people were\r\nleaving fast: the f\u00eate was over; the lamps were fading. In another hour all the\r\ndwelling-house, and all the pensionnat, were dark and hushed. I too was in bed,\r\nbut not asleep. To me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement.\r\n\n"}
{"16": "\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTHE LONG VACATION.\n\r\nFollowing Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate, with its three preceding weeks of relaxation, its\r\nbrief twelve hours\u2019 burst of hilarity and dissipation, and its one subsequent\r\nday of utter languor, came a period of reaction; two months of real\r\napplication, of close, hard study. These two months, being the last of the\r\n\u201cann\u00e9e scolaire,\u201d were indeed the only genuine working months in the year. To\r\nthem was procrastinated\u2014into them concentrated, alike by professors,\r\nmistresses, and pupils\u2014the main burden of preparation for the examinations\r\npreceding the distribution of prizes. Candidates for rewards had then to work\r\nin good earnest; masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to the wheel,\r\nto urge on the backward, and diligently aid and train the more promising. A\r\nshowy demonstration\u2014a telling exhibition\u2014must be got up for public view, and\r\nall means were fair to this end.\r\n\n\r\nI scarcely noted how the other teachers went to work; I had my own business to\r\nmind; and my task was not the least onerous, being to imbue some ninety\r\nsets of brains with a due tincture of what they considered a most complicated\r\nand difficult science, that of the English language; and to drill ninety\r\ntongues in what, for them, was an almost impossible pronunciation\u2014the lisping\r\nand hissing dentals of the Isles.\r\n\n\r\nThe examination-day arrived. Awful day! Prepared for with anxious care, dressed\r\nfor with silent despatch\u2014nothing vaporous or fluttering now\u2014no white gauze or\r\nazure streamers; the grave, close, compact was the order of the toilette. It\r\nseemed to me that I was this day, especially doomed\u2014the main burden and trial\r\nfalling on me alone of all the female teachers. The others were not expected to\r\nexamine in the studies they taught; the professor of literature, M. Paul,\r\ntaking upon himself this duty. He, this school autocrat, gathered all and\r\nsundry reins into the hollow of his one hand; he irefully rejected any\r\ncolleague; he would not have help. Madame herself, who evidently rather wished\r\nto undertake the examination in geography\u2014her favourite study, which she taught\r\nwell\u2014was forced to succumb, and be subordinate to her despotic kinsman\u2019s\r\ndirection. The whole staff of instructors, male and female, he set aside, and\r\nstood on the examiner\u2019s estrade alone. It irked him that he was forced to make\r\none exception to this rule. He could not manage English: he was obliged to\r\nleave that branch of education in the English teacher\u2019s hands; which he did,\r\nnot without a flash of na\u00efve jealousy.\r\n\n\r\nA constant crusade against the \u201camour-propre\u201d of every human being but himself,\r\nwas the crotchet of this able, but fiery and grasping little man. He had a\r\nstrong relish for public representation in his own person, but an extreme\r\nabhorrence of the like display in any other. He quelled, he kept down when he\r\ncould; and when he could not, he fumed like a bottled storm.\r\n\n\r\nOn the evening preceding the examination-day, I was walking in the garden, as\r\nwere the other teachers and all the boarders. M. Emanuel joined me in the\r\n\u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue;\u201d his cigar was at his lips; his palet\u00f4t\u2014a most characteristic\r\ngarment of no particular shape\u2014hung dark and menacing; the tassel of his bonnet\r\ngrec sternly shadowed his left temple; his black whiskers curled like those of\r\na wrathful cat; his blue eye had a cloud in its glitter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAinsi,\u201d he began, abruptly fronting and arresting me, \u201cvous allez tr\u00f4ner comme\r\nune reine; demain\u2014tr\u00f4ner \u00e0 mes c\u00f4t\u00e9s? Sans doute vous savourez d\u2019avance les\r\nd\u00e9lices de l\u2019autorit\u00e9. Je crois voir en je ne sais quoi de rayonnante, petite\r\nambitieuse!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow the fact was, he happened to be entirely mistaken. I did not\u2014could\r\nnot\u2014estimate the admiration or the good opinion of tomorrow\u2019s audience at the\r\nsame rate he did. Had that audience numbered as many personal friends and\r\nacquaintance for me as for him, I know not how it might have been: I speak of\r\nthe case as it stood. On me school-triumphs shed but a cold lustre. I had\r\nwondered\u2014and I wondered now\u2014how it was that for him they seemed to shine as\r\nwith hearth-warmth and hearth-glow. He cared for them perhaps too much;\r\nI, probably, too little. However, I had my own fancies as well as he. I\r\nliked, for instance, to see M. Emanuel jealous; it lit up his nature, and woke\r\nhis spirit; it threw all sorts of queer lights and shadows over his dun face,\r\nand into his violet-azure eyes (he used to say that his black hair and blue\r\neyes were \u201cune de ses beaut\u00e9s\u201d). There was a relish in his anger; it was\r\nartless, earnest, quite unreasonable, but never hypocritical. I uttered no\r\ndisclaimer then of the complacency he attributed to me; I merely asked where\r\nthe English examination came in\u2014whether at the commencement or close of the\r\nday?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hesitate,\u201d said he, \u201cwhether at the very beginning, before many persons are\r\ncome, and when your aspiring nature will not be gratified by a large audience,\r\nor quite at the close, when everybody is tired, and only a jaded and worn-out\r\nattention will be at your service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue vous \u00eates dur, Monsieur!\u201d I said, affecting dejection.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne ought to be \u2018dur\u2019 with you. You are one of those beings who must be\r\nkept down. I know you! I know you! Other people in this house see you\r\npass, and think that a colourless shadow has gone by. As for me, I scrutinized\r\nyour face once, and it sufficed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are satisfied that you understand me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout answering directly, he went on, \u201cWere you not gratified when you\r\nsucceeded in that vaudeville? I watched you and saw a passionate ardour for\r\ntriumph in your physiognomy. What fire shot into the glance! Not mere light,\r\nbut flame: je me tiens pour averti.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat feeling I had on that occasion, Monsieur\u2014and pardon me, if I say, you\r\nimmensely exaggerate both its quality and quantity\u2014was quite abstract. I did\r\nnot care for the vaudeville. I hated the part you assigned me. I had not the\r\nslightest sympathy with the audience below the stage. They are good people,\r\ndoubtless, but do I know them? Are they anything to me? Can I care for being\r\nbrought before their view again to-morrow? Will the examination be anything but\r\na task to me\u2014a task I wish well over?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I take it out of your hands?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith all my heart; if you do not fear failure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I should fail. I only know three phrases of English, and a few words: par\r\nexemple, de sonn, de mone, de stare\u2014est-ce bien dit? My opinion is that it\r\nwould be better to give up the thing altogether: to have no English\r\nexamination, eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf Madame consents, I consent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeartily?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery heartily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe smoked his cigar in silence. He turned suddenly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonnez-moi la main,\u201d said he, and the spite and jealousy melted out of his\r\nface, and a generous kindliness shone there instead.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, we will not be rivals, we will be friends,\u201d he pursued. \u201cThe examination\r\nshall take place, and I will choose a good moment; and instead of vexing and\r\nhindering, as I felt half-inclined ten minutes ago\u2014for I have my malevolent\r\nmoods: I always had from childhood\u2014I will aid you sincerely. After all, you are\r\nsolitary and a stranger, and have your way to make and your bread to earn; it\r\nmay be well that you should become known. We will be friends: do you agree?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOut of my heart, Monsieur. I am glad of a friend. I like that better than a\r\ntriumph.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPauvrette!\u201d said he, and turned away and left the alley.\r\n\n\r\nThe examination passed over well; M. Paul was as good as his word, and did his\r\nbest to make my part easy. The next day came the distribution of prizes; that\r\nalso passed; the school broke up; the pupils went home, and now began the long\r\nvacation.\r\n\n\r\nThat vacation! Shall I ever forget it? I think not. Madame Beck went, the first\r\nday of the holidays, to join her children at the sea-side; all the three\r\nteachers had parents or friends with whom they took refuge; every professor\r\nquitted the city; some went to Paris, some to Boue-Marine; M. Paul set forth on\r\na pilgrimage to Rome; the house was left quite empty, but for me, a servant,\r\nand a poor deformed and imbecile pupil, a sort of cr\u00e9tin, whom her stepmother\r\nin a distant province would not allow to return home.\r\n\n\r\nMy heart almost died within me; miserable longings strained its chords. How\r\nlong were the September days! How silent, how lifeless! How vast and void\r\nseemed the desolate premises! How gloomy the forsaken garden\u2014grey now with the\r\ndust of a town summer departed. Looking forward at the commencement of those\r\neight weeks, I hardly knew how I was to live to the end. My spirits had long\r\nbeen gradually sinking; now that the prop of employment was withdrawn, they\r\nwent down fast. Even to look forward was not to hope: the dumb future spoke no\r\ncomfort, offered no promise, gave no inducement to bear present evil in\r\nreliance on future good. A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on\r\nme\u2014a despairing resignation to reach betimes the end of all things earthly.\r\nAlas! When I had full leisure to look on life as life must be looked on by such\r\nas me, I found it but a hopeless desert: tawny sands, with no green fields, no\r\npalm-tree, no well in view. The hopes which are dear to youth, which bear it up\r\nand lead it on, I knew not and dared not know. If they knocked at my heart\r\nsometimes, an inhospitable bar to admission must be inwardly drawn. When they\r\nturned away thus rejected, tears sad enough sometimes flowed: but it could not\r\nbe helped: I dared not give such guests lodging. So mortally did I fear the sin\r\nand weakness of presumption.\r\n\n\r\nReligious reader, you will preach to me a long sermon about what I have just\r\nwritten, and so will you, moralist: and you, stern sage: you, stoic, will\r\nfrown; you, cynic, sneer; you, epicure, laugh. Well, each and all, take it your\r\nown way. I accept the sermon, frown, sneer, and laugh; perhaps you are all\r\nright: and perhaps, circumstanced like me, you would have been, like me, wrong.\r\nThe first month was, indeed, a long, black, heavy month to me.\r\n\n\r\nThe cr\u00e9tin did not seem unhappy. I did my best to feed her well and keep her\r\nwarm, and she only asked food and sunshine, or when that lacked, fire. Her weak\r\nfaculties approved of inertion: her brain, her eyes, her ears, her heart slept\r\ncontent; they could not wake to work, so lethargy was their Paradise.\r\n\n\r\nThree weeks of that vacation were hot, fair, and dry, but the fourth and fifth\r\nwere tempestuous and wet. I do not know why that change in the atmosphere made\r\na cruel impression on me, why the raging storm and beating rain crushed me with\r\na deadlier paralysis than I had experienced while the air had remained serene;\r\nbut so it was; and my nervous system could hardly support what it had for many\r\ndays and nights to undergo in that huge empty house. How I used to pray to\r\nHeaven for consolation and support! With what dread force the conviction would\r\ngrasp me that Fate was my permanent foe, never to be conciliated. I did not, in\r\nmy heart, arraign the mercy or justice of God for this; I concluded it to be a\r\npart of his great plan that some must deeply suffer while they live, and I\r\nthrilled in the certainty that of this number, I was one.\r\n\n\r\nIt was some relief when an aunt of the cr\u00e9tin, a kind old woman, came one day,\r\nand took away my strange, deformed companion. The hapless creature had been at\r\ntimes a heavy charge; I could not take her out beyond the garden, and I could\r\nnot leave her a minute alone: for her poor mind, like her body, was warped: its\r\npropensity was to evil. A vague bent to mischief, an aimless malevolence, made\r\nconstant vigilance indispensable. As she very rarely spoke, and would sit for\r\nhours together moping and mowing, and distorting her features with\r\nindescribable grimaces, it was more like being prisoned with some strange\r\ntameless animal, than associating with a human being. Then there were personal\r\nattentions to be rendered which required the nerve of a hospital nurse; my\r\nresolution was so tried, it sometimes fell dead-sick. These duties should not\r\nhave fallen on me; a servant, now absent, had rendered them hitherto, and in\r\nthe hurry of holiday departure, no substitute to fill this office had been\r\nprovided. This tax and trial were by no means the least I have known in life.\r\nStill, menial and distasteful as they were, my mental pain was far more wasting\r\nand wearing. Attendance on the cr\u00e9tin deprived me often of the power and\r\ninclination to swallow a meal, and sent me faint to the fresh air, and the well\r\nor fountain in the court; but this duty never wrung my heart, or brimmed my\r\neyes, or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten metal.\r\n\n\r\nThe cr\u00e9tin being gone, I was free to walk out. At first I lacked courage to\r\nventure very far from the Rue Fossette, but by degrees I sought the city gates,\r\nand passed them, and then went wandering away far along chauss\u00e9es, through\r\nfields, beyond cemeteries, Catholic and Protestant, beyond farmsteads, to lanes\r\nand little woods, and I know not where. A goad thrust me on, a fever forbade me\r\nto rest; a want of companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most\r\ndeadly famine. I often walked all day, through the burning noon and the arid\r\nafternoon, and the dusk evening, and came back with moonrise.\r\n\n\r\nWhile wandering in solitude, I would sometimes picture the present probable\r\nposition of others, my acquaintance. There was Madame Beck at a cheerful\r\nwatering-place with her children, her mother, and a whole troop of friends who\r\nhad sought the same scene of relaxation. Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre was at Paris, with\r\nher relatives; the other teachers were at their homes. There was Ginevra\r\nFanshawe, whom certain of her connections had carried on a pleasant tour\r\nsouthward. Ginevra seemed to me the happiest. She was on the route of beautiful\r\nscenery; these September suns shone for her on fertile plains, where harvest\r\nand vintage matured under their mellow beam. These gold and crystal moons rose\r\non her vision over blue horizons waved in mounted lines.\r\n\n\r\nBut all this was nothing; I too felt those autumn suns and saw those harvest\r\nmoons, and I almost wished to be covered in with earth and turf, deep out of\r\ntheir influence; for I could not live in their light, nor make them comrades,\r\nnor yield them affection. But Ginevra had a kind of spirit with her, empowered\r\nto give constant strength and comfort, to gladden daylight and embalm darkness;\r\nthe best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained her with his wings,\r\nand canopied her head with his bending form. By True Love was Ginevra followed:\r\nnever could she be alone. Was she insensible to this presence? It seemed to me\r\nimpossible: I could not realize such deadness. I imagined her grateful in\r\nsecret, loving now with reserve; but purposing one day to show how much she\r\nloved: I pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy fondness, and\r\ncomforted by that consciousness: I conceived an electric chord of sympathy\r\nbetween them, a fine chain of mutual understanding, sustaining union through a\r\nseparation of a hundred leagues\u2014carrying, across mound and hollow,\r\ncommunication by prayer and wish. Ginevra gradually became with me a sort of\r\nheroine. One day, perceiving this growing illusion, I said, \u201cI really believe\r\nmy nerves are getting overstretched: my mind has suffered somewhat too much a\r\nmalady is growing upon it\u2014what shall I do? How shall I keep well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIndeed there was no way to keep well under the circumstances. At last a day and\r\nnight of peculiarly agonizing depression were succeeded by physical illness, I\r\ntook perforce to my bed. About this time the Indian summer closed and the\r\nequinoctial storms began; and for nine dark and wet days, of which the hours\r\nrushed on all turbulent, deaf, dishevelled\u2014bewildered with sounding hurricane\u2014I\r\nlay in a strange fever of the nerves and blood. Sleep went quite away. I used\r\nto rise in the night, look round for her, beseech her earnestly to return. A\r\nrattle of the window, a cry of the blast only replied\u2014Sleep never came!\r\n\n\r\nI err. She came once, but in anger. Impatient of my importunity she brought\r\nwith her an avenging dream. By the clock of St. Jean Baptiste, that dream\r\nremained scarce fifteen minutes\u2014a brief space, but sufficing to wring my whole\r\nframe with unknown anguish; to confer a nameless experience that had the hue,\r\nthe mien, the terror, the very tone of a visitation from eternity. Between\r\ntwelve and one that night a cup was forced to my lips, black, strong, strange,\r\ndrawn from no well, but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea.\r\nSuffering, brewed in temporal or calculable measure, and mixed for mortal lips,\r\ntastes not as this suffering tasted. Having drank and woke, I thought all was\r\nover: the end come and past by. Trembling fearfully\u2014as consciousness\r\nreturned\u2014ready to cry out on some fellow-creature to help me, only that I knew\r\nno fellow-creature was near enough to catch the wild summons\u2014Goton in her far\r\ndistant attic could not hear\u2014I rose on my knees in bed. Some fearful hours went\r\nover me: indescribably was I torn, racked and oppressed in mind. Amidst the\r\nhorrors of that dream I think the worst lay here. Methought the well-loved\r\ndead, who had loved me well in life, met me elsewhere, alienated: galled\r\nwas my inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair about the future.\r\nMotive there was none why I should try to recover or wish to live; and yet\r\nquite unendurable was the pitiless and haughty voice in which Death challenged\r\nme to engage his unknown terrors. When I tried to pray I could only utter these\r\nwords: \u201cFrom my youth up Thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMost true was it.\r\n\n\r\nOn bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me to call in a doctor. I would\r\nnot: I thought no doctor could cure me.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening\u2014and I was not delirious: I was in my sane mind, I got up\u2014I dressed\r\nmyself, weak and shaking. The solitude and the stillness of the long dormitory\r\ncould not be borne any longer; the ghastly white beds were turning into\r\nspectres\u2014the coronal of each became a death\u2019s-head, huge and sun-bleached\u2014dead\r\ndreams of an elder world and mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping\r\neyeholes. That evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the\r\nconviction that Fate was of stone, and Hope a false idol\u2014blind, bloodless, and\r\nof granite core. I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining\r\nits climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling as\r\nthey were. It rained still, and blew; but with more clemency, I thought, than\r\nit had poured and raged all day. Twilight was falling, and I deemed its\r\ninfluence pitiful; from the lattice I saw coming night-clouds trailing low like\r\nbanners drooping. It seemed to me that at this hour there was affection and\r\nsorrow in Heaven above for all pain suffered on earth beneath; the weight of my\r\ndreadful dream became alleviated\u2014that insufferable thought of being no more\r\nloved\u2014no more owned, half-yielded to hope of the contrary\u2014I was sure this hope\r\nwould shine clearer if I got out from under this house-roof, which was crushing\r\nas the slab of a tomb, and went outside the city to a certain quiet hill, a\r\nlong way distant in the fields. Covered with a cloak (I could not be delirious,\r\nfor I had sense and recollection to put on warm clothing), forth I set. The\r\nbells of a church arrested me in passing; they seemed to call me in to the\r\nsalut, and I went in. Any solemn rite, any spectacle of sincere worship,\r\nany opening for appeal to God was as welcome to me then as bread to one in\r\nextremity of want. I knelt down with others on the stone pavement. It was an\r\nold solemn church, its pervading gloom not gilded but purpled by light shed\r\nthrough stained glass.\r\n\n\r\nFew worshippers were assembled, and, the salut over, half of them\r\ndeparted. I discovered soon that those left remained to confess. I did not\r\nstir. Carefully every door of the church was shut; a holy quiet sank upon, and\r\na solemn shade gathered about us. After a space, breathless and spent in\r\nprayer, a penitent approached the confessional. I watched. She whispered her\r\navowal; her shrift was whispered back; she returned consoled. Another went, and\r\nanother. A pale lady, kneeling near me, said in a low, kind voice:\u2014\u201cGo you now,\r\nI am not quite prepared.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMechanically obedient, I rose and went. I knew what I was about; my mind had\r\nrun over the intent with lightning-speed. To take this step could not make me\r\nmore wretched than I was; it might soothe me.\r\n\n\r\nThe priest within the confessional never turned his eyes to regard me; he only\r\nquietly inclined his ear to my lips. He might be a good man, but this duty had\r\nbecome to him a sort of form: he went through it with the phlegm of custom. I\r\nhesitated; of the formula of confession I was ignorant: instead of commencing,\r\nthen, with the prelude usual, I said:\u2014\u201cMon p\u00e8re, je suis Protestante.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe directly turned. He was not a native priest: of that class, the cast of\r\nphysiognomy is, almost invariably, grovelling: I saw by his profile and brow he\r\nwas a Frenchman; though grey and advanced in years, he did not, I think, lack\r\nfeeling or intelligence. He inquired, not unkindly, why, being a Protestant, I\r\ncame to him?\r\n\n\r\nI said I was perishing for a word of advice or an accent of comfort. I had been\r\nliving for some weeks quite alone; I had been ill; I had a pressure of\r\naffliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer endure the weight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it a sin, a crime?\u201d he inquired, somewhat startled. I reassured him on\r\nthis point, and, as well as I could, I showed him the mere outline of my\r\nexperience.\r\n\n\r\nHe looked thoughtful, surprised, puzzled. \u201cYou take me unawares,\u201d said he. \u201cI\r\nhave not had such a case as yours before: ordinarily we know our routine, and\r\nare prepared; but this makes a great break in the common course of confession.\r\nI am hardly furnished with counsel fitting the circumstances.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course, I had not expected he would be; but the mere relief of communication\r\nin an ear which was human and sentient, yet consecrated\u2014the mere pouring out of\r\nsome portion of long accumulating, long pent-up pain into a vessel whence it\r\ncould not be again diffused\u2014had done me good. I was already solaced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust I go, father?\u201d I asked of him as he sat silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d he said kindly\u2014and I am sure he was a kind man: he had a\r\ncompassionate eye\u2014\u201cfor the present you had better go: but I assure you your\r\nwords have struck me. Confession, like other things, is apt to become formal\r\nand trivial with habit. You have come and poured your heart out; a thing seldom\r\ndone. I would fain think your case over, and take it with me to my oratory.\r\nWere you of our faith I should know what to say\u2014a mind so tossed can find\r\nrepose but in the bosom of retreat, and the punctual practice of piety. The\r\nworld, it is well known, has no satisfaction for that class of natures. Holy\r\nmen have bidden penitents like you to hasten their path upward by penance,\r\nself-denial, and difficult good works. Tears are given them here for meat and\r\ndrink\u2014bread of affliction and waters of affliction\u2014their recompence comes\r\nhereafter. It is my own conviction that these impressions under which you are\r\nsmarting are messengers from God to bring you back to the true Church. You were\r\nmade for our faith: depend upon it our faith alone could heal and help\r\nyou\u2014Protestantism is altogether too dry, cold, prosaic for you. The further I\r\nlook into this matter, the more plainly I see it is entirely out of the common\r\norder of things. On no account would I lose sight of you. Go, my daughter, for\r\nthe present; but return to me again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI rose and thanked him. I was withdrawing when he signed me to return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must not come to this church,\u201d said he: \u201cI see you are ill, and this\r\nchurch is too cold; you must come to my house: I live\u2014\u2014\u201d (and he gave me his\r\naddress). \u201cBe there to-morrow morning at ten.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn reply to this appointment, I only bowed; and pulling down my veil, and\r\ngathering round me my cloak, I glided away.\r\n\n\r\nDid I, do you suppose, reader, contemplate venturing again within that worthy\r\npriest\u2019s reach? As soon should I have thought of walking into a Babylonish\r\nfurnace. That priest had arms which could influence me: he was naturally kind,\r\nwith a sentimental French kindness, to whose softness I knew myself not wholly\r\nimpervious. Without respecting some sorts of affection, there was hardly any\r\nsort having a fibre of root in reality, which I could rely on my force wholly\r\nto withstand. Had I gone to him, he would have shown me all that was tender,\r\nand comforting, and gentle, in the honest Popish superstition. Then he would\r\nhave tried to kindle, blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works. I know not\r\nhow it would all have ended. We all think ourselves strong in some points; we\r\nall know ourselves weak in many; the probabilities are that had I visited\r\nNumero 10, Rue des Mages, at the hour and day appointed, I might just now,\r\ninstead of writing this heretic narrative, be counting my beads in the cell of\r\na certain Carmelite convent on the Boulevard of Cr\u00e9cy, in Villette. There was\r\nsomething of F\u00e9n\u00e9lon about that benign old priest; and whatever most of his\r\nbrethren may be, and whatever I may think of his Church and creed (and I like\r\nneither), of himself I must ever retain a grateful recollection. He was kind\r\nwhen I needed kindness; he did me good. May Heaven bless him!\r\n\n\r\nTwilight had passed into night, and the lamps were lit in the streets ere I\r\nissued from that sombre church. To turn back was now become possible to me; the\r\nwild longing to breathe this October wind on the little hill far without the\r\ncity walls had ceased to be an imperative impulse, and was softened into a wish\r\nwith which Reason could cope: she put it down, and I turned, as I thought, to\r\nthe Rue Fossette. But I had become involved in a part of the city with which I\r\nwas not familiar; it was the old part, and full of narrow streets of\r\npicturesque, ancient, and mouldering houses. I was much too weak to be very\r\ncollected, and I was still too careless of my own welfare and safety to be\r\ncautious; I grew embarrassed; I got immeshed in a network of turns unknown. I\r\nwas lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger.\r\n\n\r\nIf the storm had lulled a little at sunset, it made up now for lost time.\r\nStrong and horizontal thundered the current of the wind from north-west to\r\nsouth-east; it brought rain like spray, and sometimes a sharp hail, like shot:\r\nit was cold and pierced me to the vitals. I bent my head to meet it, but it\r\nbeat me back. My heart did not fail at all in this conflict; I only wished that\r\nI had wings and could ascend the gale, spread and repose my pinions on its\r\nstrength, career in its course, sweep where it swept. While wishing this, I\r\nsuddenly felt colder where before I was cold, and more powerless where before I\r\nwas weak. I tried to reach the porch of a great building near, but the mass of\r\nfrontage and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes. Instead of\r\nsinking on the steps as I intended, I seemed to pitch headlong down an abyss. I\r\nremember no more.\r\n\n"}
{"17": "\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nAULD LANG SYNE.\n\r\nWhere my soul went during that swoon I cannot tell. Whatever she saw, or\r\nwherever she travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept her own\r\nsecret; never whispering a word to Memory, and baffling imagination by an\r\nindissoluble silence. She may have gone upward, and come in sight of her\r\neternal home, hoping for leave to rest now, and deeming that her painful union\r\nwith matter was at last dissolved. While she so deemed, an angel may have\r\nwarned her away from heaven\u2019s threshold, and, guiding her weeping down, have\r\nbound her, once more, all shuddering and unwilling, to that poor frame, cold\r\nand wasted, of whose companionship she was grown more than weary.\r\n\n\r\nI know she re-entered her prison with pain, with reluctance, with a moan and a\r\nlong shiver. The divorced mates, Spirit and Substance, were hard to re-unite:\r\nthey greeted each other, not in an embrace, but a racking sort of struggle. The\r\nreturning sense of sight came upon me, red, as if it swam in blood; suspended\r\nhearing rushed back loud, like thunder; consciousness revived in fear: I sat up\r\nappalled, wondering into what region, amongst what strange beings I was waking.\r\nAt first I knew nothing I looked on: a wall was not a wall\u2014a lamp not a lamp. I\r\nshould have understood what we call a ghost, as well as I did the commonest\r\nobject: which is another way of intimating that all my eye rested on struck it\r\nas spectral. But the faculties soon settled each in his place; the life-machine\r\npresently resumed its wonted and regular working.\r\n\n\r\nStill, I knew not where I was; only in time I saw I had been removed from the\r\nspot where I fell: I lay on no portico-step; night and tempest were excluded by\r\nwalls, windows, and ceiling. Into some house I had been carried\u2014but what house?\r\n\n\r\nI could only think of the pensionnat in the Rue Fossette. Still half-dreaming,\r\nI tried hard to discover in what room they had put me; whether the great\r\ndormitory, or one of the little dormitories. I was puzzled, because I could not\r\nmake the glimpses of furniture I saw accord with my knowledge of any of these\r\napartments. The empty white beds were wanting, and the long line of large\r\nwindows. \u201cSurely,\u201d thought I, \u201cit is not to Madame Beck\u2019s own chamber they have\r\ncarried me!\u201d And here my eye fell on an easy-chair covered with blue damask.\r\nOther seats, cushioned to match, dawned on me by degrees; and at last I took in\r\nthe complete fact of a pleasant parlour, with a wood fire on a clear-shining\r\nhearth, a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved a ground of shaded\r\nfawn; pale walls over which a slight but endless garland of azure\r\nforget-me-nots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad gold leaves and\r\ntendrils. A gilded mirror filled up the space between two windows, curtained\r\namply with blue damask. In this mirror I saw myself laid, not in bed, but on a\r\nsofa. I looked spectral; my eyes larger and more hollow, my hair darker than\r\nwas natural, by contrast with my thin and ashen face. It was obvious, not only\r\nfrom the furniture, but from the position of windows, doors, and fireplace,\r\nthat this was an unknown room in an unknown house.\r\n\n\r\nHardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet settled; for, as I gazed at\r\nthe blue arm-chair, it appeared to grow familiar; so did a certain\r\nscroll-couch, and not less so the round centre-table, with a blue-covering,\r\nbordered with autumn-tinted foliage; and, above all, two little footstools with\r\nworked covers, and a small ebony-framed chair, of which the seat and back were\r\nalso worked with groups of brilliant flowers on a dark ground.\r\n\n\r\nStruck with these things, I explored further. Strange to say, old acquaintance\r\nwere all about me, and \u201cauld lang syne\u201d smiled out of every nook. There were\r\ntwo oval miniatures over the mantel-piece, of which I knew by heart the pearls\r\nabout the high and powdered \u201cheads;\u201d the velvets circling the white throats;\r\nthe swell of the full muslin kerchiefs: the pattern of the lace sleeve-ruffles.\r\nUpon the mantel-shelf there were two china vases, some relics of a diminutive\r\ntea-service, as smooth as enamel and as thin as egg-shell, and a white centre\r\nornament, a classic group in alabaster, preserved under glass. Of all these\r\nthings I could have told the peculiarities, numbered the flaws or cracks, like\r\nany clairvoyante. Above all, there was a pair of handscreens, with\r\nelaborate pencil-drawings finished like line engravings; these, my very eyes\r\nached at beholding again, recalling hours when they had followed, stroke by\r\nstroke and touch by touch, a tedious, feeble, finical, school-girl pencil held\r\nin these fingers, now so skeleton-like.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was I? Not only in what spot of the world, but in what year of our Lord?\r\nFor all these objects were of past days, and of a distant country. Ten years\r\nago I bade them good-by; since my fourteenth year they and I had never met. I\r\ngasped audibly, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA shape hitherto unnoticed, stirred, rose, came forward: a shape inharmonious\r\nwith the environment, serving only to complicate the riddle further. This was\r\nno more than a sort of native bonne, in a common-place bonne\u2019s cap and\r\nprint-dress. She spoke neither French nor English, and I could get no\r\nintelligence from her, not understanding her phrases of dialect. But she bathed\r\nmy temples and forehead with some cool and perfumed water, and then she\r\nheightened the cushion on which I reclined, made signs that I was not to speak,\r\nand resumed her post at the foot of the sofa.\r\n\n\r\nShe was busy knitting; her eyes thus drawn from me, I could gaze on her without\r\ninterruption. I did mightily wonder how she came there, or what she could have\r\nto do among the scenes, or with the days of my girlhood. Still more I marvelled\r\nwhat those scenes and days could now have to do with me.\r\n\n\r\nToo weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery, I tried to settle it by saying\r\nit was a mistake, a dream, a fever-fit; and yet I knew there could be no\r\nmistake, and that I was not sleeping, and I believed I was sane. I wished the\r\nroom had not been so well lighted, that I might not so clearly have seen the\r\nlittle pictures, the ornaments, the screens, the worked chair. All these\r\nobjects, as well as the blue-damask furniture, were, in fact, precisely the\r\nsame, in every minutest detail, with those I so well remembered, and with which\r\nI had been so thoroughly intimate, in the drawing-room of my godmother\u2019s house\r\nat Bretton. Methought the apartment only was changed, being of different\r\nproportions and dimensions.\r\n\n\r\nI thought of Bedreddin Hassan, transported in his sleep from Cairo to the gates\r\nof Damascus. Had a Genius stooped his dark wing down the storm to whose stress\r\nI had succumbed, and gathering me from the church-steps, and \u201crising high into\r\nthe air,\u201d as the eastern tale said, had he borne me over land and ocean, and\r\nlaid me quietly down beside a hearth of Old England? But no; I knew the fire of\r\nthat hearth burned before its Lares no more\u2014it went out long ago, and the\r\nhousehold gods had been carried elsewhere.\r\n\n\r\nThe bonne turned again to survey me, and seeing my eyes wide open, and, I\r\nsuppose, deeming their expression perturbed and excited, she put down her\r\nknitting. I saw her busied for a moment at a little stand; she poured out\r\nwater, and measured drops from a phial: glass in hand, she approached me. What\r\ndark-tinged draught might she now be offering? what Genii-elixir or\r\nMagi-distillation?\r\n\n\r\nIt was too late to inquire\u2014I had swallowed it passively, and at once. A tide of\r\nquiet thought now came gently caressing my brain; softer and softer rose the\r\nflow, with tepid undulations smoother than balm. The pain of weakness left my\r\nlimbs, my muscles slept. I lost power to move; but, losing at the same time\r\nwish, it was no privation. That kind bonne placed a screen between me and the\r\nlamp; I saw her rise to do this, but do not remember seeing her resume her\r\nplace: in the interval between the two acts, I \u201cfell on sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt waking, lo! all was again changed. The light of high day surrounded me; not,\r\nindeed, a warm, summer light, but the leaden gloom of raw and blustering\r\nautumn. I felt sure now that I was in the pensionnat\u2014sure by the beating rain\r\non the casement; sure by the \u201cwuther\u201d of wind amongst trees, denoting a garden\r\noutside; sure by the chill, the whiteness, the solitude, amidst which I lay. I\r\nsay whiteness\u2014for the dimity curtains, dropped before a French bed,\r\nbounded my view.\r\n\n\r\nI lifted them; I looked out. My eye, prepared to take in the range of a long,\r\nlarge, and whitewashed chamber, blinked baffled, on encountering the limited\r\narea of a small cabinet\u2014a cabinet with sea-green walls; also, instead of five\r\nwide and naked windows, there was one high lattice, shaded with muslin\r\nfestoons: instead of two dozen little stands of painted wood, each holding a\r\nbasin and an ewer, there was a toilette-table dressed, like a lady for a ball,\r\nin a white robe over a pink skirt; a polished and large glass crowned, and a\r\npretty pin-cushion frilled with lace, adorned it. This toilette, together with\r\na small, low, green and white chintz arm-chair, a washstand topped with a\r\nmarble slab, and supplied with utensils of pale-green ware, sufficiently\r\nfurnished the tiny chamber.\r\n\n\r\nReader; I felt alarmed! Why? you will ask. What was there in this simple and\r\nsomewhat pretty sleeping-closet to startle the most timid? Merely this\u2014These\r\narticles of furniture could not be real, solid arm-chairs, looking-glasses, and\r\nwashstands\u2014they must be the ghosts of such articles; or, if this were denied as\r\ntoo wild an hypothesis\u2014and, confounded as I was, I did deny it\u2014there\r\nremained but to conclude that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of\r\nmind; in short, that I was very ill and delirious: and even then, mine was the\r\nstrangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim.\r\n\n\r\nI knew\u2014I was obliged to know\u2014the green chintz of that little chair; the little\r\nsnug chair itself, the carved, shining-black, foliated frame of that glass; the\r\nsmooth, milky-green of the china vessels on the stand; the very stand too, with\r\nits top of grey marble, splintered at one corner;\u2014all these I was compelled to\r\nrecognise and to hail, as last night I had, perforce, recognised and hailed the\r\nrosewood, the drapery, the porcelain, of the drawing-room.\r\n\n\r\nBretton! Bretton! and ten years ago shone reflected in that mirror. And why did\r\nBretton and my fourteenth year haunt me thus? Why, if they came at all, did\r\nthey not return complete? Why hovered before my distempered vision the mere\r\nfurniture, while the rooms and the locality were gone? As to that pincushion\r\nmade of crimson satin, ornamented with gold beads and frilled with thread-lace,\r\nI had the same right to know it as to know the screens\u2014I had made it myself.\r\nRising with a start from the bed, I took the cushion in my hand and examined\r\nit. There was the cipher \u201cL. L. B.\u201d formed in gold beds, and surrounded with an\r\noval wreath embroidered in white silk. These were the initials of my\r\ngodmother\u2019s name\u2014Louisa Lucy Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I in England? Am I at Bretton?\u201d I muttered; and hastily pulling up the\r\nblind with which the lattice was shrouded, I looked out to try and discover\r\nwhere I was; half-prepared to meet the calm, old, handsome buildings and\r\nclean grey pavement of St. Ann\u2019s Street, and to see at the end the towers of\r\nthe minster: or, if otherwise, fully expectant of a town view somewhere, a rue\r\nin Villette, if not a street in a pleasant and ancient English city.\r\n\n\r\nI looked, on the contrary, through a frame of leafage, clustering round the\r\nhigh lattice, and forth thence to a grassy mead-like level, a lawn-terrace with\r\ntrees rising from the lower ground beyond\u2014high forest-trees, such as I had not\r\nseen for many a day. They were now groaning under the gale of October, and\r\nbetween their trunks I traced the line of an avenue, where yellow leaves lay in\r\nheaps and drifts, or were whirled singly before the sweeping west wind.\r\nWhatever landscape might lie further must have been flat, and these tall\r\nbeeches shut it out. The place seemed secluded, and was to me quite strange: I\r\ndid not know it at all.\r\n\n\r\nOnce more I lay down. My bed stood in a little alcove; on turning my face to\r\nthe wall, the room with its bewildering accompaniments became excluded.\r\nExcluded? No! For as I arranged my position in this hope, behold, on the green\r\nspace between the divided and looped-up curtains, hung a broad, gilded\r\npicture-frame enclosing a portrait. It was drawn\u2014well drawn, though but a\r\nsketch\u2014in water-colours; a head, a boy\u2019s head, fresh, life-like, speaking, and\r\nanimated. It seemed a youth of sixteen, fair-complexioned, with sanguine health\r\nin his cheek; hair long, not dark, and with a sunny sheen; penetrating eyes, an\r\narch mouth, and a gay smile. On the whole a most pleasant face to look at,\r\nespecially for those claiming a right to that youth\u2019s affections\u2014parents, for\r\ninstance, or sisters. Any romantic little school-girl might almost have loved\r\nit in its frame. Those eyes looked as if when somewhat older they would flash a\r\nlightning-response to love: I cannot tell whether they kept in store the\r\nsteady-beaming shine of faith. For whatever sentiment met him in form too\r\nfacile, his lips menaced, beautifully but surely, caprice and light esteem.\r\n\n\r\nStriving to take each new discovery as quietly as I could, I whispered to\r\nmyself\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! that portrait used to hang in the breakfast-room, over the mantel-piece:\r\nsomewhat too high, as I thought. I well remember how I used to mount a\r\nmusic-stool for the purpose of unhooking it, holding it in my hand, and\r\nsearching into those bonny wells of eyes, whose glance under their hazel lashes\r\nseemed like a pencilled laugh; and well I liked to note the colouring of the\r\ncheek, and the expression of the mouth.\u201d I hardly believed fancy could improve\r\non the curve of that mouth, or of the chin; even my ignorance knew that\r\nboth were beautiful, and pondered perplexed over this doubt: \u201cHow it was that\r\nwhat charmed so much, could at the same time so keenly pain?\u201d Once, by way of\r\ntest, I took little Missy Home, and, lifting her in my arms, told her to look\r\nat the picture.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like it, Polly?\u201d I asked. She never answered, but gazed long, and at\r\nlast a darkness went trembling through her sensitive eye, as she said, \u201cPut me\r\ndown.\u201d So I put her down, saying to myself. \u201cThe child feels it too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll these things do I now think over, adding, \u201cHe had his faults, yet scarce\r\never was a finer nature; liberal, suave, impressible.\u201d My reflections closed in\r\nan audibly pronounced word, \u201cGraham!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham!\u201d echoed a sudden voice at the bedside. \u201cDo you want Graham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked. The plot was but thickening; the wonder but culminating. If it was\r\nstrange to see that well-remembered pictured form on the wall, still stranger\r\nwas it to turn and behold the equally well-remembered living form opposite\u2014a\r\nwoman, a lady, most real and substantial, tall, well-attired, wearing widow\u2019s\r\nsilk, and such a cap as best became her matron and motherly braids of hair.\r\nHers, too, was a good face; too marked, perhaps, now for beauty, but not for\r\nsense or character. She was little changed; something sterner, something more\r\nrobust\u2014but she was my godmother: still the distinct vision of Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\nI kept quiet, yet internally I was much agitated: my pulse fluttered,\r\nand the blood left my cheek, which turned cold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadam, where am I?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn a very safe asylum; well protected for the present; make your mind quite\r\neasy till you get a little better; you look ill this morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so entirely bewildered, I do not know whether I can trust my senses at\r\nall, or whether they are misleading me in every particular: but you speak\r\nEnglish, do you not, madam?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should think you might hear that: it would puzzle me to hold a long\r\ndiscourse in French.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not come from England?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am lately arrived thence. Have you been long in this country? You seem to\r\nknow my son?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo, I, madam? Perhaps I do. Your son\u2014the picture there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is his portrait as a youth. While looking at it, you pronounced his\r\nname.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI speak to Mrs. Bretton, formerly of Bretton, \u2014\u2014shire?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite right; and you, I am told, are an English teacher in a foreign school\r\nhere: my son recognised you as such.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow was I found, madam, and by whom?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy son shall tell you that by-and-by,\u201d said she; \u201cbut at present you are too\r\nconfused and weak for conversation: try to eat some breakfast, and then sleep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNotwithstanding all I had undergone\u2014the bodily fatigue, the perturbation of\r\nspirits, the exposure to weather\u2014it seemed that I was better: the fever, the\r\nreal malady which had oppressed my frame, was abating; for, whereas during the\r\nlast nine days I had taken no solid food, and suffered from continual thirst,\r\nthis morning, on breakfast being offered, I experienced a craving for\r\nnourishment: an inward faintness which caused me eagerly to taste the tea this\r\nlady offered, and to eat the morsel of dry toast she allowed in accompaniment.\r\nIt was only a morsel, but it sufficed; keeping up my strength till some two or\r\nthree hours afterwards, when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth and a\r\nbiscuit.\r\n\n\r\nAs evening began to darken, and the ceaseless blast still blew wild and cold,\r\nand the rain streamed on, deluge-like, I grew weary\u2014very weary of my bed. The\r\nroom, though pretty, was small: I felt it confining: I longed for a change. The\r\nincreasing chill and gathering gloom, too, depressed me; I wanted to see\u2014to\r\nfeel firelight. Besides, I kept thinking of the son of that tall matron: when\r\nshould I see him? Certainly not till I left my room.\r\n\n\r\nAt last the bonne came to make my bed for the night. She prepared to wrap me in\r\na blanket and place me in the little chintz chair; but, declining these\r\nattentions, I proceeded to dress myself:\r\n\n\r\nThe business was just achieved, and I was sitting down to take breath, when\r\nMrs. Bretton once more appeared.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDressed!\u201d she exclaimed, smiling with that smile I so well knew\u2014a pleasant\r\nsmile, though not soft. \u201cYou are quite better then? Quite strong\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe spoke to me so much as of old she used to speak that I almost fancied she\r\nwas beginning to know me. There was the same sort of patronage in her voice and\r\nmanner that, as a girl, I had always experienced from her\u2014a patronage I yielded\r\nto and even liked; it was not founded on conventional grounds of superior\r\nwealth or station (in the last particular there had never been any inequality;\r\nher degree was mine); but on natural reasons of physical advantage: it was the\r\nshelter the tree gives the herb. I put a request without further ceremony.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo let me go down-stairs, madam; I am so cold and dull here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI desire nothing better, if you are strong enough to bear the change,\u201d was her\r\nreply. \u201cCome then; here is an arm.\u201d And she offered me hers: I took it, and we\r\ndescended one flight of carpeted steps to a landing where a tall door, standing\r\nopen, gave admission into the blue-damask room. How pleasant it was in its air\r\nof perfect domestic comfort! How warm in its amber lamp-light and vermilion\r\nfire-flush! To render the picture perfect, tea stood ready on the table\u2014an\r\nEnglish tea, whereof the whole shining service glanced at me familiarly; from\r\nthe solid silver urn, of antique pattern, and the massive pot of the same\r\nmetal, to the thin porcelain cups, dark with purple and gilding. I knew the\r\nvery seed-cake of peculiar form, baked in a peculiar mould, which always had a\r\nplace on the tea-table at Bretton. Graham liked it, and there it was as of\r\nyore\u2014set before Graham\u2019s plate with the silver knife and fork beside it. Graham\r\nwas then expected to tea: Graham was now, perhaps, in the house; ere many\r\nminutes I might see him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSit down\u2014sit down,\u201d said my conductress, as my step faltered a little in\r\npassing to the hearth. She seated me on the sofa, but I soon passed behind it,\r\nsaying the fire was too hot; in its shade I found another seat which suited me\r\nbetter. Mrs. Bretton was never wont to make a fuss about any person or\r\nanything; without remonstrance she suffered me to have my own way. She made the\r\ntea, and she took up the newspaper. I liked to watch every action of my\r\ngodmother; all her movements were so young: she must have been now above fifty,\r\nyet neither her sinews nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age.\r\nThough portly, she was alert, and though serene, she was at times\r\nimpetuous\u2014good health and an excellent temperament kept her green as in her\r\nspring.\r\n\n\r\nWhile she read, I perceived she listened\u2014listened for her son. She was not the\r\nwoman ever to confess herself uneasy, but there was yet no lull in the weather,\r\nand if Graham were out in that hoarse wind\u2014roaring still unsatisfied\u2014I well\r\nknew his mother\u2019s heart would be out with him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTen minutes behind his time,\u201d said she, looking at her watch; then, in another\r\nminute, a lifting of her eyes from the page, and a slight inclination of her\r\nhead towards the door, denoted that she heard some sound. Presently her brow\r\ncleared; and then even my ear, less practised, caught the iron clash of a gate\r\nswung to, steps on gravel, lastly the door-bell. He was come. His mother filled\r\nthe teapot from the urn, she drew nearer the hearth the stuffed and cushioned\r\nblue chair\u2014her own chair by right, but I saw there was one who might with\r\nimpunity usurp it. And when that one came up the stairs\u2014which he soon\r\ndid, after, I suppose, some such attention to the toilet as the wild and wet\r\nnight rendered necessary, and strode straight in\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it you, Graham?\u201d said his mother, hiding a glad smile and speaking curtly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho else should it be, mamma?\u201d demanded the Unpunctual, possessing himself\r\nirreverently of the abdicated throne.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you deserve cold tea, for being late?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall not get my deserts, for the urn sings cheerily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWheel yourself to the table, lazy boy: no seat will serve you but mine; if you\r\nhad one spark of a sense of propriety, you would always leave that chair for\r\nthe Old Lady.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo I should; only the dear Old Lady persists in leaving it for me. How is your\r\npatient, mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill she come forward and speak for herself?\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, turning to my\r\ncorner; and at this invitation, forward I came. Graham courteously rose up to\r\ngreet me. He stood tall on the hearth, a figure justifying his mother\u2019s\r\nunconcealed pride.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo you are come down,\u201d said he; \u201cyou must be better then\u2014much better. I\r\nscarcely expected we should meet thus, or here. I was alarmed last night, and\r\nif I had not been forced to hurry away to a dying patient, I certainly would\r\nnot have left you; but my mother herself is something of a doctress, and Martha\r\nan excellent nurse. I saw the case was a fainting-fit, not necessarily\r\ndangerous. What brought it on, I have yet to learn, and all particulars;\r\nmeantime, I trust you really do feel better?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cMuch better, I thank you, Dr. John.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor, reader, this tall young man\u2014this darling son\u2014this host of mine\u2014this Graham\r\nBretton, was Dr. John: he, and no other; and, what is more, I\r\nascertained this identity scarcely with surprise. What is more, when I heard\r\nGraham\u2019s step on the stairs, I knew what manner of figure would enter, and for\r\nwhose aspect to prepare my eyes. The discovery was not of to-day, its dawn had\r\npenetrated my perceptions long since. Of course I remembered young Bretton\r\nwell; and though ten years (from sixteen to twenty-six) may greatly change the\r\nboy as they mature him to the man, yet they could bring no such utter\r\ndifference as would suffice wholly to blind my eyes, or baffle my memory. Dr.\r\nJohn Graham Bretton retained still an affinity to the youth of sixteen: he had\r\nhis eyes; he had some of his features; to wit, all the excellently-moulded\r\nlower half of the face; I found him out soon. I first recognised him on that\r\noccasion, noted several chapters back, when my unguardedly-fixed attention had\r\ndrawn on me the mortification of an implied rebuke. Subsequent observation\r\nconfirmed, in every point, that early surmise. I traced in the gesture, the\r\nport, and the habits of his manhood, all his boy\u2019s promise. I heard in his now\r\ndeep tones the accent of former days. Certain turns of phrase, peculiar to him\r\nof old, were peculiar to him still; and so was many a trick of eye and lip,\r\nmany a smile, many a sudden ray levelled from the irid, under his\r\nwell-charactered brow.\r\n\n\r\nTo say anything on the subject, to hint at my discovery, had not\r\nsuited my habits of thought, or assimilated with my system of feeling. On the\r\ncontrary, I had preferred to keep the matter to myself. I liked entering his\r\npresence covered with a cloud he had not seen through, while he stood before me\r\nunder a ray of special illumination which shone all partial over his head,\r\ntrembled about his feet, and cast light no farther.\r\n\n\r\nWell I knew that to him it could make little difference, were I to come forward\r\nand announce, \u201cThis is Lucy Snowe!\u201d So I kept back in my teacher\u2019s place; and\r\nas he never asked my name, so I never gave it. He heard me called \u201cMiss,\u201d and\r\n\u201cMiss Lucy;\u201d he never heard the surname, \u201cSnowe.\u201d As to spontaneous\r\nrecognition\u2014though I, perhaps, was still less changed than he\u2014the idea never\r\napproached his mind, and why should I suggest it?\r\n\n\r\nDuring tea, Dr. John was kind, as it was his nature to be; that meal over, and\r\nthe tray carried out, he made a cosy arrangement of the cushions in a corner of\r\nthe sofa, and obliged me to settle amongst them. He and his mother also drew to\r\nthe fire, and ere we had sat ten minutes, I caught the eye of the latter\r\nfastened steadily upon me. Women are certainly quicker in some things than men.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she exclaimed, presently, \u201cI have seldom seen a stronger likeness!\r\nGraham, have you observed it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cObserved what? What ails the Old Lady now? How you stare, mamma! One would\r\nthink you had an attack of second sight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me, Graham, of whom does that young lady remind you?\u201d pointing to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma, you put her out of countenance. I often tell you abruptness is your\r\nfault; remember, too, that to you she is a stranger, and does not know your\r\nways.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, when she looks down; now, when she turns sideways, who is she like,\r\nGraham?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, mamma, since you propound the riddle, I think you ought to solve it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you have known her some time, you say\u2014ever since you first began to attend\r\nthe school in the Rue Fossette:\u2014yet you never mentioned to me that singular\r\nresemblance!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could not mention a thing of which I never thought, and which I do not now\r\nacknowledge. What can you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStupid boy! look at her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGraham did look: but this was not to be endured; I saw how it must end, so I\r\nthought it best to anticipate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John,\u201d I said, \u201chas had so much to do and think of, since he and I shook\r\nhands at our last parting in St. Ann\u2019s Street, that, while I readily found out\r\nMr. Graham Bretton, some months ago, it never occurred to me as possible that\r\nhe should recognise Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy Snowe! I thought so! I knew it!\u201d cried Mrs. Bretton. And she at once\r\nstepped across the hearth and kissed me. Some ladies would, perhaps, have made\r\na great bustle upon such a discovery without being particularly glad of it; but\r\nit was not my godmother\u2019s habit to make a bustle, and she preferred all\r\nsentimental demonstrations in bas-relief. So she and I got over the surprise\r\nwith few words and a single salute; yet I daresay she was pleased, and I know I\r\nwas. While we renewed old acquaintance, Graham, sitting opposite, silently\r\ndisposed of his paroxysm of astonishment.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma calls me a stupid boy, and I think I am so,\u201d at length he said; \u201cfor,\r\nupon my honour, often as I have seen you, I never once suspected this fact: and\r\nyet I perceive it all now. Lucy Snowe! To be sure! I recollect her perfectly,\r\nand there she sits; not a doubt of it. But,\u201d he added, \u201cyou surely have not\r\nknown me as an old acquaintance all this time, and never mentioned it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I have,\u201d was my answer.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John commented not. I supposed he regarded my silence as eccentric, but he\r\nwas indulgent in refraining from censure. I daresay, too, he would have deemed\r\nit impertinent to have interrogated me very closely, to have asked me the why\r\nand wherefore of my reserve; and, though he might feel a little curious, the\r\nimportance of the case was by no means such as to tempt curiosity to infringe\r\non discretion.\r\n\n\r\nFor my part, I just ventured to inquire whether he remembered the circumstance\r\nof my once looking at him very fixedly; for the slight annoyance he had\r\nbetrayed on that occasion still lingered sore on my mind.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I do!\u201d said he: \u201cI think I was even cross with you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou considered me a little bold; perhaps?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Only, shy and retiring as your general manner was, I wondered what\r\npersonal or facial enormity in me proved so magnetic to your usually averted\r\neyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see how it was now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd here Mrs. Bretton broke in with many, many questions about past times; and\r\nfor her satisfaction I had to recur to gone-by troubles, to explain causes of\r\nseeming estrangement, to touch on single-handed conflict with Life, with Death,\r\nwith Grief, with Fate. Dr. John listened, saying little. He and she then told\r\nme of changes they had known: even with them all had not gone smoothly, and\r\nfortune had retrenched her once abundant gifts. But so courageous a mother,\r\nwith such a champion in her son, was well fitted to fight a good fight with the\r\nworld, and to prevail ultimately. Dr. John himself was one of those on whose\r\nbirth benign planets have certainly smiled. Adversity might set against him her\r\nmost sullen front: he was the man to beat her down with smiles. Strong and\r\ncheerful, and firm and courteous; not rash, yet valiant; he was the aspirant to\r\nwoo Destiny herself, and to win from her stone eyeballs a beam almost loving.\r\n\n\r\nIn the profession he had adopted, his success was now quite decided. Within the\r\nlast three months he had taken this house (a small ch\u00e2teau, they told me, about\r\nhalf a league without the Porte de Cr\u00e9cy); this country site being chosen for\r\nthe sake of his mother\u2019s health, with which town air did not now agree. Hither\r\nhe had invited Mrs. Bretton, and she, on leaving England, had brought with her\r\nsuch residue furniture of the former St. Ann\u2019s Street mansion as she had\r\nthought fit to keep unsold. Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs,\r\nand the wraiths of looking-glasses, tea-urns, and teacups.\r\n\n\r\nAs the clock struck eleven, Dr. John stopped his mother.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe must retire now,\u201d he said; \u201cshe is beginning to look very pale.\r\nTo-morrow I will venture to put some questions respecting the cause of her loss\r\nof health. She is much changed, indeed, since last July, when I saw her enact\r\nwith no little spirit the part of a very killing fine gentleman. As to last\r\nnight\u2019s catastrophe, I am sure thereby hangs a tale, but we will inquire no\r\nfurther this evening. Good-night, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so he kindly led me to the door, and holding a wax-candle, lighted me up\r\nthe one flight of stairs.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had said my prayers, and when I was undressed and laid down, I felt that\r\nI still had friends. Friends, not professing vehement attachment, not offering\r\nthe tender solace of well-matched and congenial relationship; on whom,\r\ntherefore, but moderate demand of affection was to be made, of whom but\r\nmoderate expectation formed; but towards whom my heart softened instinctively,\r\nand yearned with an importunate gratitude, which I entreated Reason betimes to\r\ncheck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not let me think of them too often, too much, too fondly,\u201d I implored: \u201clet\r\nme be content with a temperate draught of this living stream: let me not run\r\nathirst, and apply passionately to its welcome waters: let me not imagine in\r\nthem a sweeter taste than earth\u2019s fountains know. Oh! would to God I may be\r\nenabled to feel enough sustained by an occasional, amicable intercourse, rare,\r\nbrief, unengrossing and tranquil: quite tranquil!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill repeating this word, I turned to my pillow; and still repeating\r\nit, I steeped that pillow with tears.\r\n\n"}
{"18": "\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nLA TERRASSE.\n\r\nThese struggles with the natural character, the strong native bent of the\r\nheart, may seem futile and fruitless, but in the end they do good. They tend,\r\nhowever slightly, to give the actions, the conduct, that turn which Reason\r\napproves, and which Feeling, perhaps, too often opposes: they certainly make a\r\ndifference in the general tenour of a life, and enable it to be better\r\nregulated, more equable, quieter on the surface; and it is on the surface only\r\nthe common gaze will fall. As to what lies below, leave that with God. Man,\r\nyour equal, weak as you, and not fit to be your judge, may be shut out thence:\r\ntake it to your Maker\u2014show Him the secrets of the spirit He gave\u2014ask Him how\r\nyou are to bear the pains He has appointed\u2014kneel in His presence, and pray with\r\nfaith for light in darkness, for strength in piteous weakness, for patience in\r\nextreme need. Certainly, at some hour, though perhaps not your hour, the\r\nwaiting waters will stir; in some shape, though perhaps not the shape\r\nyou dreamed, which your heart loved, and for which it bled, the healing herald\r\nwill descend, the cripple and the blind, and the dumb, and the possessed will\r\nbe led to bathe. Herald, come quickly! Thousands lie round the pool, weeping\r\nand despairing, to see it, through slow years, stagnant. Long are the \u201ctimes\u201d\r\nof Heaven: the orbits of angel messengers seem wide to mortal vision; they may\r\nenring ages: the cycle of one departure and return may clasp unnumbered\r\ngenerations; and dust, kindling to brief suffering life, and through pain,\r\npassing back to dust, may meanwhile perish out of memory again, and yet again.\r\nTo how many maimed and mourning millions is the first and sole angel visitant,\r\nhim easterns call Azrael!\r\n\n\r\nI tried to get up next morning, but while I was dressing, and at intervals\r\ndrinking cold water from the carafe on my washstand, with design to\r\nbrace up that trembling weakness which made dressing so difficult, in came Mrs.\r\nBretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere is an absurdity!\u201d was her morning accost. \u201cNot so,\u201d she added, and\r\ndealing with me at once in her own brusque, energetic fashion\u2014that fashion\r\nwhich I used formerly to enjoy seeing applied to her son, and by him vigorously\r\nresisted\u2014in two minutes she consigned me captive to the French bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere you lie till afternoon,\u201d said she. \u201cMy boy left orders before he went\r\nout that such should be the case, and I can assure you my son is master and\r\nmust be obeyed. Presently you shall have breakfast.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPresently she brought that meal\u2014brought it with her own active hands\u2014not\r\nleaving me to servants. She seated herself on the bed while I ate. Now it is\r\nnot everybody, even amongst our respected friends and esteemed acquaintance,\r\nwhom we like to have near us, whom we like to watch us, to wait on us, to\r\napproach us with the proximity of a nurse to a patient. It is not every friend\r\nwhose eye is a light in a sick room, whose presence is there a solace: but all\r\nthis was Mrs. Bretton to me; all this she had ever been. Food or drink never\r\npleased me so well as when it came through her hands. I do not remember the\r\noccasion when her entrance into a room had not made that room cheerier. Our\r\nnatures own predilections and antipathies alike strange. There are people from\r\nwhom we secretly shrink, whom we would personally avoid, though reason\r\nconfesses that they are good people: there are others with faults of temper,\r\n&c., evident enough, beside whom we live content, as if the air about them\r\ndid us good. My godmother\u2019s lively black eye and clear brunette cheek, her\r\nwarm, prompt hand, her self-reliant mood, her decided bearing, were all\r\nbeneficial to me as the atmosphere of some salubrious climate. Her son used to\r\ncall her \u201cthe old lady;\u201d it filled me with pleasant wonder to note how the\r\nalacrity and power of five-and-twenty still breathed from her and around her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would bring my work here,\u201d she said, as she took from me the emptied teacup,\r\n\u201cand sit with you the whole day, if that overbearing John Graham had not put\r\nhis veto upon such a proceeding. \u2018Now, mamma,\u2019 he said, when he went out, \u2018take\r\nnotice, you are not to knock up your god-daughter with gossip,\u2019 and he\r\nparticularly desired me to keep close to my own quarters, and spare you my fine\r\ncompany. He says, Lucy, he thinks you have had a nervous fever, judging from\r\nyour look,\u2014is that so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I did not quite know what my ailment had been, but that I had\r\ncertainly suffered a good deal especially in mind. Further, on this subject, I\r\ndid not consider it advisable to dwell, for the details of what I had undergone\r\nbelonged to a portion of my existence in which I never expected my godmother to\r\ntake a share. Into what a new region would such a confidence have led that\r\nhale, serene nature! The difference between her and me might be figured by that\r\nbetween the stately ship cruising safe on smooth seas, with its full complement\r\nof crew, a captain gay and brave, and venturous and provident; and the\r\nlife-boat, which most days of the year lies dry and solitary in an old, dark\r\nboat-house, only putting to sea when the billows run high in rough weather,\r\nwhen cloud encounters water, when danger and death divide between them the rule\r\nof the great deep. No, the \u201cLouisa Bretton\u201d never was out of harbour on such a\r\nnight, and in such a scene: her crew could not conceive it; so the half-drowned\r\nlife-boat man keeps his own counsel, and spins no yarns.\r\n\n\r\nShe left me, and I lay in bed content: it was good of Graham to remember me\r\nbefore he went out.\r\n\n\r\nMy day was lonely, but the prospect of coming evening abridged and cheered it.\r\nThen, too, I felt weak, and rest seemed welcome; and after the morning hours\r\nwere gone by,\u2014those hours which always bring, even to the necessarily\r\nunoccupied, a sense of business to be done, of tasks waiting fulfilment, a\r\nvague impression of obligation to be employed\u2014when this stirring time was past,\r\nand the silent descent of afternoon hushed housemaid steps on the stairs and in\r\nthe chambers, I then passed into a dreamy mood, not unpleasant.\r\n\n\r\nMy calm little room seemed somehow like a cave in the sea. There was no colour\r\nabout it, except that white and pale green, suggestive of foam and deep water;\r\nthe blanched cornice was adorned with shell-shaped ornaments, and there were\r\nwhite mouldings like dolphins in the ceiling-angles. Even that one touch of\r\ncolour visible in the red satin pincushion bore affinity to coral; even that\r\ndark, shining glass might have mirrored a mermaid. When I closed my eyes, I\r\nheard a gale, subsiding at last, bearing upon the house-front like a settling\r\nswell upon a rock-base. I heard it drawn and withdrawn far, far off, like a\r\ntide retiring from a shore of the upper world\u2014a world so high above that the\r\nrush of its largest waves, the dash of its fiercest breakers, could sound down\r\nin this submarine home, only like murmurs and a lullaby.\r\n\n\r\nAmidst these dreams came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with her aid\r\nI was quickly dressed, and stronger now than in the morning, I made my way down\r\nto the blue saloon unassisted.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John, it appears, had concluded his round of professional calls earlier\r\nthan usual; his form was the first object that met my eyes as I entered the\r\nparlour; he stood in that window-recess opposite the door, reading the close\r\ntype of a newspaper by such dull light as closing day yet gave. The fire shone\r\nclear, but the lamp stood on the table unlit, and tea was not yet brought up.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Mrs. Bretton, my active godmother\u2014who, I afterwards found, had been out\r\nin the open air all day\u2014lay half-reclined in her deep-cushioned chair, actually\r\nlost in a nap. Her son seeing me, came forward. I noticed that he trod\r\ncarefully, not to wake the sleeper; he also spoke low: his mellow voice never\r\nhad any sharpness in it; modulated as at present, it was calculated rather to\r\nsoothe than startle slumber.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is a quiet little ch\u00e2teau,\u201d he observed, after inviting me to sit near\r\nthe casement. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you may have noticed it in your walks:\r\nthough, indeed, from the chauss\u00e9e it is not visible; just a mile beyond the\r\nPorte de Cr\u00e9cy, you turn down a lane which soon becomes an avenue, and that\r\nleads you on, through meadow and shade, to the very door of this house. It is\r\nnot a modern place, but built somewhat in the old style of the Basse-Ville. It\r\nis rather a manoir than a ch\u00e2teau; they call it \u2018La Terrasse,\u2019 because its\r\nfront rises from a broad turfed walk, whence steps lead down a grassy slope to\r\nthe avenue. See yonder! The moon rises: she looks well through the tree-boles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhere, indeed, does the moon not look well? What is the scene, confined or\r\nexpansive, which her orb does not hallow? Rosy or fiery, she mounted now above\r\na not distant bank; even while we watched her flushed ascent, she cleared to\r\ngold, and in very brief space, floated up stainless into a now calm sky. Did\r\nmoonlight soften or sadden Dr. Bretton? Did it touch him with romance? I think\r\nit did. Albeit of no sighing mood, he sighed in watching it: sighed to himself\r\nquietly. No need to ponder the cause or the course of that sigh; I knew it was\r\nwakened by beauty; I knew it pursued Ginevra. Knowing this, the idea pressed\r\nupon me that it was in some sort my duty to speak the name he meditated. Of\r\ncourse he was ready for the subject: I saw in his countenance a teeming\r\nplenitude of comment, question and interest; a pressure of language and\r\nsentiment, only checked, I thought, by sense of embarrassment how to begin. To\r\nspare him this embarrassment was my best, indeed my sole use. I had but to\r\nutter the idol\u2019s name, and love\u2019s tender litany would flow out. I had just\r\nfound a fitting phrase, \u201cYou know that Miss Fanshawe is gone on a tour with the\r\nCholmondeleys,\u201d and was opening my lips to speak to it, when he scattered my\r\nplans by introducing another theme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing this morning,\u201d said he, putting his sentiment in his pocket,\r\nturning from the moon, and sitting down, \u201cI went to the Rue Fossette, and told\r\nthe cuisini\u00e8re that you were safe and in good hands. Do you know that I\r\nactually found that she had not yet discovered your absence from the house: she\r\nthought you safe in the great dormitory. With what care you must have been\r\nwaited on!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! all that is very conceivable,\u201d said I. \u201cGoton could do nothing for me but\r\nbring me a little tisane and a crust of bread, and I had rejected both so often\r\nduring the past week, that the good woman got tired of useless journeys from\r\nthe dwelling-house kitchen to the school-dormitory, and only came once a day at\r\nnoon to make my bed. I believe, however, that she is a good-natured creature,\r\nand would have been delighted to cook me c\u00f4telettes de mouton, if I could have\r\neaten them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did Madame Beck mean by leaving you alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame Beck could not foresee that I should fall ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour nervous system bore a good share of the suffering?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not quite sure what my nervous system is, but I was dreadfully\r\nlow-spirited.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhich disables me from helping you by pill or potion. Medicine can give nobody\r\ngood spirits. My art halts at the threshold of Hypochondria: she just looks in\r\nand sees a chamber of torture, but can neither say nor do much. Cheerful\r\nsociety would be of use; you should be as little alone as possible; you should\r\ntake plenty of exercise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAcquiescence and a pause followed these remarks. They sounded all right, I\r\nthought, and bore the safe sanction of custom, and the well-worn stamp of use.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d recommenced Dr. John\u2014my health, nervous system included, being\r\nnow, somewhat to my relief, discussed and done with\u2014\u201cis it permitted me to ask\r\nwhat your religion is? Are you a Catholic?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI looked up in some surprise\u2014\u201cA Catholic? No! Why suggest such an idea?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe manner in which you were consigned to me last night made me doubt.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI consigned to you? But, indeed, I forget. It yet remains for me to learn how\r\nI fell into your hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, under circumstances that puzzled me. I had been in attendance all day\r\nyesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical character; the\r\ndisease being rare, and its treatment doubtful: I saw a similar and still finer\r\ncase in a hospital in Paris; but that will not interest you. At last a\r\nmitigation of the patient\u2019s most urgent symptoms (acute pain is one of its\r\naccompaniments) liberated me, and I set out homeward. My shortest way lay\r\nthrough the Basse-Ville, and as the night was excessively dark, wild, and wet,\r\nI took it. In riding past an old church belonging to a community of B\u00e9guines, I\r\nsaw by a lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance, a priest\r\nlifting some object in his arms. The lamp was bright enough to reveal the\r\npriest\u2019s features clearly, and I recognised him; he was a man I have often met\r\nby the sick beds of both rich and poor: and chiefly the latter. He is, I think,\r\na good old man, far better than most of his class in this country; superior,\r\nindeed, in every way, better informed, as well as more devoted to duty. Our\r\neyes met; he called on me to stop: what he supported was a woman, fainting or\r\ndying. I alighted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This person is one of your countrywomen,\u2019 he said: \u2018save her, if she is not\r\ndead.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy countrywoman, on examination, turned out to be the English teacher at\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s pensionnat. She was perfectly unconscious, perfectly bloodless,\r\nand nearly cold.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What does it all mean?\u2019 was my inquiry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe communicated a curious account; that you had been to him that evening at\r\nconfessional; that your exhausted and suffering appearance, coupled with some\r\nthings you had said\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThings I had said? I wonder what things!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAwful crimes, no doubt; but he did not tell me what: there, you know, the seal\r\nof the confessional checked his garrulity, and my curiosity. Your confidences,\r\nhowever, had not made an enemy of the good father; it seems he was so struck,\r\nand felt so sorry that you should be out on such a night alone, that he had\r\nesteemed it a Christian duty to watch you when you quitted the church, and so\r\nto manage as not to lose sight of you, till you should have reached home.\r\nPerhaps the worthy man might, half unconsciously, have blent in this proceeding\r\nsome little of the subtlety of his class: it might have been his resolve to\r\nlearn the locality of your home\u2014did you impart that in your confession?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not: on the contrary, I carefully avoided the shadow of any indication:\r\nand as to my confession, Dr. John, I suppose you will think me mad for taking\r\nsuch a step, but I could not help it: I suppose it was all the fault of what\r\nyou call my \u2018nervous system.\u2019 I cannot put the case into words, but my days and\r\nnights were grown intolerable: a cruel sense of desolation pained my mind: a\r\nfeeling that would make its way, rush out, or kill me\u2014like (and this you will\r\nunderstand, Dr. John) the current which passes through the heart, and which, if\r\naneurism or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels, seeks\r\nabnormal outlet. I wanted companionship, I wanted friendship, I wanted counsel.\r\nI could find none of these in closet or chamber, so I went and sought them in\r\nchurch and confessional. As to what I said, it was no confidence, no narrative.\r\nI have done nothing wrong: my life has not been active enough for any dark\r\ndeed, either of romance or reality: all I poured out was a dreary, desperate\r\ncomplaint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, you ought to travel for about six months: why, your calm nature is\r\ngrowing quite excitable! Confound Madame Beck! Has the little buxom widow no\r\nbowels, to condemn her best teacher to solitary confinement?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not Madame Beck\u2019s fault,\u201d said I; \u201cit is no living being\u2019s fault, and I\r\nwon\u2019t hear any one blamed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is in the wrong, then, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMe\u2014Dr. John\u2014me; and a great abstraction on whose wide shoulders I like to lay\r\nthe mountains of blame they were sculptured to bear: me and Fate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Me\u2019 must take better care in future,\u201d said Dr. John\u2014smiling, I suppose, at my\r\nbad grammar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChange of air\u2014change of scene; those are my prescriptions,\u201d pursued the\r\npractical young doctor. \u201cBut to return to our muttons, Lucy. As yet, P\u00e8re\r\nSilas, with all his tact (they say he is a Jesuit), is no wiser than you choose\r\nhim to be; for, instead of returning to the Rue Fossette, your fevered\r\nwanderings\u2014there must have been high fever\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Dr. John: the fever took its turn that night\u2014now, don\u2019t make out that I\r\nwas delirious, for I know differently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood! you were as collected as myself at this moment, no doubt. Your\r\nwanderings had taken an opposite direction to the pensionnat. Near the\r\nB\u00e9guinage, amidst the stress of flood and gust, and in the perplexity of\r\ndarkness, you had swooned and fallen. The priest came to your succour, and the\r\nphysician, as we have seen, supervened. Between us we procured a fiacre and\r\nbrought you here. P\u00e8re Silas, old as he is, would carry you up-stairs, and lay\r\nyou on that couch himself. He would certainly have remained with you till\r\nsuspended animation had been restored: and so should I, but, at that juncture,\r\na hurried messenger arrived from the dying patient I had scarcely left\u2014the last\r\nduties were called for\u2014the physician\u2019s last visit and the priest\u2019s last rite;\r\nextreme unction could not be deferred. P\u00e8re Silas and myself departed together,\r\nmy mother was spending the evening abroad; we gave you in charge to Martha,\r\nleaving directions, which it seems she followed successfully. Now, are you a\r\nCatholic?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said I, with a smile. \u201cAnd never let P\u00e8re Silas know where I live,\r\nor he will try to convert me; but give him my best and truest thanks when you\r\nsee him, and if ever I get rich I will send him money for his charities. See,\r\nDr. John, your mother wakes; you ought to ring for tea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich he did; and, as Mrs. Bretton sat up\u2014astonished and indignant at herself\r\nfor the indulgence to which she had succumbed, and fully prepared to deny that\r\nshe had slept at all\u2014her son came gaily to the attack.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHushaby, mamma! Sleep again. You look the picture of innocence in your\r\nslumbers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy slumbers, John Graham! What are you talking about? You know I never\r\ndo sleep by day: it was the slightest doze possible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExactly! a seraph\u2019s gentle lapse\u2014a fairy\u2019s dream. Mamma, under such\r\ncircumstances, you always remind me of Titania.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is because you, yourself, are so like Bottom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe\u2014did you ever hear anything like mamma\u2019s wit? She is a most\r\nsprightly woman of her size and age.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep your compliments to yourself, sir, and do not neglect your own size:\r\nwhich seems to me a good deal on the increase. Lucy, has he not rather the air\r\nof an incipient John Bull? He used to be slender as an eel, and now I fancy in\r\nhim a sort of heavy dragoon bent\u2014a beef-eater tendency. Graham, take notice! If\r\nyou grow fat I disown you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if you could not sooner disown your own personality! I am indispensable to\r\nthe old lady\u2019s happiness, Lucy. She would pine away in green and yellow\r\nmelancholy if she had not my six feet of iniquity to scold. It keeps her\r\nlively\u2014it maintains the wholesome ferment of her spirits.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe two were now standing opposite to each other, one on each side the\r\nfire-place; their words were not very fond, but their mutual looks atoned for\r\nverbal deficiencies. At least, the best treasure of Mrs. Bretton\u2019s life was\r\ncertainly casketed in her son\u2019s bosom; her dearest pulse throbbed in his heart.\r\nAs to him, of course another love shared his feelings with filial love, and, no\r\ndoubt, as the new passion was the latest born, so he assigned it in his\r\nemotions Benjamin\u2019s portion. Ginevra! Ginevra! Did Mrs. Bretton yet know at\r\nwhose feet her own young idol had laid his homage? Would she approve that\r\nchoice? I could not tell; but I could well guess that if she knew Miss\r\nFanshawe\u2019s conduct towards Graham: her alternations between coldness and\r\ncoaxing, and repulse and allurement; if she could at all suspect the pain with\r\nwhich she had tried him; if she could have seen, as I had seen, his fine\r\nspirits subdued and harassed, his inferior preferred before him, his\r\nsubordinate made the instrument of his humiliation\u2014then Mrs. Bretton\r\nwould have pronounced Ginevra imbecile, or perverted, or both. Well\u2014I thought\r\nso too.\r\n\n\r\nThat second evening passed as sweetly as the first\u2014more sweetly indeed:\r\nwe enjoyed a smoother interchange of thought; old troubles were not reverted\r\nto, acquaintance was better cemented; I felt happier, easier, more at home.\r\nThat night\u2014instead of crying myself asleep\u2014I went down to dreamland by a\r\npathway bordered with pleasant thoughts.\r\n\n"}
{"19": "\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nWE QUARREL.\n\r\nDuring the first days of my stay at the Terrace, Graham never took a seat near\r\nme, or in his frequent pacing of the room approached the quarter where I sat,\r\nor looked pre-occupied, or more grave than usual, but I thought of Miss\r\nFanshawe and expected her name to leap from his lips. I kept my ear and mind in\r\nperpetual readiness for the tender theme; my patience was ordered to be\r\npermanently under arms, and my sympathy desired to keep its cornucopia\r\nreplenished and ready for outpouring. At last, and after a little inward\r\nstruggle, which I saw and respected, he one day launched into the topic. It was\r\nintroduced delicately; anonymously as it were.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour friend is spending her vacation in travelling, I hear?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFriend, forsooth!\u201d thought I to myself: but it would not do to contradict; he\r\nmust have his own way; I must own the soft impeachment: friend let it be.\r\nStill, by way of experiment, I could not help asking whom he meant?\r\n\n\r\nHe had taken a seat at my work-table; he now laid hands on a reel of thread\r\nwhich he proceeded recklessly to unwind.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra\u2014Miss Fanshawe, has accompanied the Cholmondeleys on a tour through the\r\nsouth of France?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you and she correspond?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will astonish you to hear that I never once thought of making application\r\nfor that privilege.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have seen letters of her writing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; several to her uncle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey will not be deficient in wit and na\u00efvet\u00e9; there is so much\r\nsparkle, and so little art in her soul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe writes comprehensively enough when she writes to M. de Bassompierre: he\r\nwho runs may read.\u201d (In fact, Ginevra\u2019s epistles to her wealthy kinsman were\r\ncommonly business documents, unequivocal applications for cash.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd her handwriting? It must be pretty, light, ladylike, I should think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was, and I said so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI verily believe that all she does is well done,\u201d said Dr. John; and as I\r\nseemed in no hurry to chime in with this remark, he added \u201cYou, who know her,\r\ncould you name a point in which she is deficient?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe does several things very well.\u201d (\u201cFlirtation amongst the rest,\u201d subjoined\r\nI, in thought.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen do you suppose she will return to town?\u201d he soon inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, Dr. John, I must explain. You honour me too much in ascribing to me\r\na degree of intimacy with Miss Fanshawe I have not the felicity to enjoy. I\r\nhave never been the depositary of her plans and secrets. You will find her\r\nparticular friends in another sphere than mine: amongst the Cholmondeleys, for\r\ninstance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe actually thought I was stung with a kind of jealous pain similar to his own!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse her,\u201d he said; \u201cjudge her indulgently; the glitter of fashion misleads\r\nher, but she will soon find out that these people are hollow, and will return\r\nto you with augmented attachment and confirmed trust. I know something of the\r\nCholmondeleys: superficial, showy, selfish people; depend on it, at heart\r\nGinevra values you beyond a score of such.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind,\u201d I said briefly.\r\n\n\r\nA disclaimer of the sentiments attributed to me burned on my lips, but I\r\nextinguished the flame. I submitted to be looked upon as the humiliated,\r\ncast-off, and now pining confidante of the distinguished Miss Fanshawe: but,\r\nreader, it was a hard submission.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet, you see,\u201d continued Graham, \u201cwhile I comfort you, I cannot take\r\nthe same consolation to myself; I cannot hope she will do me justice. De Hamal\r\nis most worthless, yet I fear he pleases her: wretched delusion!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy patience really gave way, and without notice: all at once. I suppose illness\r\nand weakness had worn it and made it brittle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton,\u201d I broke out, \u201cthere is no delusion like your own. On all points\r\nbut one you are a man, frank, healthful, right-thinking, clear-sighted: on this\r\nexceptional point you are but a slave. I declare, where Miss Fanshawe is\r\nconcerned, you merit no respect; nor have you mine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI got up, and left the room very much excited.\r\n\n\r\nThis little scene took place in the morning; I had to meet him again in the\r\nevening, and then I saw I had done mischief. He was not made of common clay,\r\nnot put together out of vulgar materials; while the outlines of his nature had\r\nbeen shaped with breadth and vigour, the details embraced workmanship of almost\r\nfeminine delicacy: finer, much finer, than you could be prepared to meet with;\r\nthan you could believe inherent in him, even after years of acquaintance.\r\nIndeed, till some over-sharp contact with his nerves had betrayed, by its\r\neffects, their acute sensibility, this elaborate construction must be ignored;\r\nand the more especially because the sympathetic faculty was not prominent in\r\nhim: to feel, and to seize quickly another\u2019s feelings, are separate properties;\r\na few constructions possess both, some neither. Dr. John had the one in\r\nexquisite perfection; and because I have admitted that he was not endowed with\r\nthe other in equal degree, the reader will considerately refrain from passing\r\nto an extreme, and pronouncing him _un_sympathizing, unfeeling: on the\r\ncontrary, he was a kind, generous man. Make your need known, his hand was open.\r\nPut your grief into words, he turned no deaf ear. Expect refinements of\r\nperception, miracles of intuition, and realize disappointment. This night, when\r\nDr. John entered the room, and met the evening lamp, I saw well and at one\r\nglance his whole mechanism.\r\n\n\r\nTo one who had named him \u201cslave,\u201d and, on any point, banned him from respect,\r\nhe must now have peculiar feelings. That the epithet was well applied, and the\r\nban just, might be; he put forth no denial that it was so: his mind even\r\ncandidly revolved that unmanning possibility. He sought in this accusation the\r\ncause of that ill-success which had got so galling a hold on his mental peace:\r\nAmid the worry of a self-condemnatory soliloquy, his demeanour seemed grave,\r\nperhaps cold, both to me and his mother. And yet there was no bad feeling, no\r\nmalice, no rancour, no littleness in his countenance, beautiful with a man\u2019s\r\nbest beauty, even in its depression. When I placed his chair at the table,\r\nwhich I hastened to do, anticipating the servant, and when I handed him his\r\ntea, which I did with trembling care, he said: \u201cThank you, Lucy,\u201d in as kindly\r\na tone of his full pleasant voice as ever my ear welcomed.\r\n\n\r\nFor my part, there was only one plan to be pursued; I must expiate my culpable\r\nvehemence, or I must not sleep that night. This would not do at all; I could\r\nnot stand it: I made no pretence of capacity to wage war on this footing.\r\nSchool solitude, conventual silence and stagnation, anything seemed preferable\r\nto living embroiled with Dr. John. As to Ginevra, she might take the silver\r\nwings of a dove, or any other fowl that flies, and mount straight up to the\r\nhighest place, among the highest stars, where her lover\u2019s highest flight of\r\nfancy chose to fix the constellation of her charms: never more be it mine to\r\ndispute the arrangement. Long I tried to catch his eye. Again and again that\r\neye just met mine; but, having nothing to say, it withdrew, and I was baffled.\r\nAfter tea, he sat, sad and quiet, reading a book. I wished I could have dared\r\nto go and sit near him, but it seemed that if I ventured to take that step, he\r\nwould infallibly evince hostility and indignation. I longed to speak out, and I\r\ndared not whisper. His mother left the room; then, moved by insupportable\r\nregret, I just murmured the words \u201cDr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked up from his book; his eyes were not cold or malevolent, his mouth was\r\nnot cynical; he was ready and willing to hear what I might have to say: his\r\nspirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunder-clap.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton, forgive my hasty words: do, do forgive them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe smiled that moment I spoke. \u201cPerhaps I deserved them, Lucy. If you don\u2019t\r\nrespect me, I am sure it is because I am not respectable. I fear, I am an\r\nawkward fool: I must manage badly in some way, for where I wish to please, it\r\nseems I don\u2019t please.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf that you cannot be sure; and even if such be the case, is it the fault of\r\nyour character, or of another\u2019s perceptions? But now, let me unsay what I said\r\nin anger. In one thing, and in all things, I deeply respect you. If you think\r\nscarcely enough of yourself, and too much of others, what is that but an\r\nexcellence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I think too much of Ginevra?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe you may; you believe you can\u2019t. Let us agree to\r\ndiffer. Let me be pardoned; that is what I ask.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you think I cherish ill-will for one warm word?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see you do not and cannot; but just say, \u2018Lucy, I forgive you!\u2019 Say that, to\r\nease me of the heart-ache.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPut away your heart-ache, as I will put away mine; for you wounded me a\r\nlittle, Lucy. Now, when the pain is gone, I more than forgive: I feel grateful,\r\nas to a sincere well-wisher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am your sincere well-wisher: you are right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus our quarrel ended.\r\n\n\r\nReader, if in the course of this work, you find that my opinion of Dr. John\r\nundergoes modification, excuse the seeming inconsistency. I give the feeling as\r\nat the time I felt it; I describe the view of character as it appeared when\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\n\r\nHe showed the fineness of his nature by being kinder to me after that\r\nmisunderstanding than before. Nay, the very incident which, by my theory, must\r\nin some degree estrange me and him, changed, indeed, somewhat our relations;\r\nbut not in the sense I painfully anticipated. An invisible, but a cold\r\nsomething, very slight, very transparent, but very chill: a sort of screen of\r\nice had hitherto, all through our two lives, glazed the medium through which we\r\nexchanged intercourse. Those few warm words, though only warm with anger,\r\nbreathed on that frail frost-work of reserve; about this time, it gave note of\r\ndissolution. I think from that day, so long as we continued friends, he never\r\nin discourse stood on topics of ceremony with me. He seemed to know that if he\r\nwould but talk about himself, and about that in which he was most interested,\r\nmy expectation would always be answered, my wish always satisfied. It follows,\r\nas a matter of course, that I continued to hear much of \u201cGinevra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra!\u201d He thought her so fair, so good; he spoke so lovingly of her charms,\r\nher sweetness, her innocence, that, in spite of my plain prose knowledge of the\r\nreality, a kind of reflected glow began to settle on her idea, even for me.\r\nStill, reader, I am free to confess, that he often talked nonsense; but I\r\nstrove to be unfailingly patient with him. I had had my lesson: I had learned\r\nhow severe for me was the pain of crossing, or grieving, or disappointing him.\r\nIn a strange and new sense, I grew most selfish, and quite powerless to deny\r\nmyself the delight of indulging his mood, and being pliant to his will. He\r\nstill seemed to me most absurd when he obstinately doubted, and desponded about\r\nhis power to win in the end Miss Fanshawe\u2019s preference. The fancy became rooted\r\nin my own mind more stubbornly than ever, that she was only coquetting to goad\r\nhim, and that, at heart, she coveted every one of his words and looks.\r\nSometimes he harassed me, in spite of my resolution to bear and hear; in the\r\nmidst of the indescribable gall-honey pleasure of thus bearing and hearing, he\r\nstruck so on the flint of what firmness I owned, that it emitted fire once and\r\nagain. I chanced to assert one day, with a view to stilling his impatience,\r\nthat in my own mind, I felt positive Miss Fanshawe must intend\r\neventually to accept him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPositive! It was easy to say so, but had I any grounds for such assurance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe best grounds.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Lucy, do tell me what!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know them as well as I; and, knowing them, Dr. John, it really amazes me\r\nthat you should not repose the frankest confidence in her fidelity. To doubt,\r\nunder the circumstances, is almost to insult.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow you are beginning to speak fast and to breathe short; but speak a little\r\nfaster and breathe a little shorter, till you have given an explanation\u2014a full\r\nexplanation: I must have it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou shall, Dr. John. In some cases, you are a lavish, generous man: you are a\r\nworshipper ever ready with the votive offering should P\u00e8re Silas ever convert\r\nyou, you will give him abundance of alms for his poor, you will supply\r\nhis altar with tapers, and the shrine of your favourite saint you will do your\r\nbest to enrich: Ginevra, Dr. John\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said he, \u201cdon\u2019t go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush, I will not: and go on I will: Ginevra has had her hands\r\nfilled from your hands more times than I can count. You have sought for her the\r\ncostliest flowers; you have busied your brain in devising gifts the most\r\ndelicate: such, one would have thought, as only a woman could have imagined;\r\nand in addition, Miss Fanshawe owns a set of ornaments, to purchase which your\r\ngenerosity must have verged on extravagance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe modesty Ginevra herself had never evinced in this matter, now flushed all\r\nover the face of her admirer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d he said, destructively snipping a skein of silk with my scissors.\r\n\u201cI offered them to please myself: I felt she did me a favour in accepting\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe did more than a favour, Dr. John: she pledged her very honour that she\r\nwould make you some return; and if she cannot pay you in affection, she ought\r\nto hand out a business-like equivalent, in the shape of some rouleaux of gold\r\npieces.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand her; she is far too disinterested to care for my\r\ngifts, and too simple-minded to know their value.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI laughed out: I had heard her adjudge to every jewel its price; and well I\r\nknew money-embarrassment, money-schemes; money\u2019s worth, and endeavours to\r\nrealise supplies, had, young as she was, furnished the most frequent, and the\r\nfavourite stimulus of her thoughts for years.\r\n\n\r\nHe pursued. \u201cYou should have seen her whenever I have laid on her lap some\r\ntrifle; so cool, so unmoved: no eagerness to take, not even pleasure in\r\ncontemplating. Just from amiable reluctance to grieve me, she would permit the\r\nbouquet to lie beside her, and perhaps consent to bear it away. Or, if I\r\nachieved the fastening of a bracelet on her ivory arm, however pretty the\r\ntrinket might be (and I always carefully chose what seemed to me pretty,\r\nand what of course was not valueless), the glitter never dazzled her bright\r\neyes: she would hardly cast one look on my gift.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, of course, not valuing it, she would unloose, and return it to you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; for such a repulse she was too good-natured. She would consent to seem to\r\nforget what I had done, and retain the offering with lady-like quiet and easy\r\noblivion. Under such circumstances, how can a man build on acceptance of his\r\npresents as a favourable symptom? For my part, were I to offer her all I have,\r\nand she to take it, such is her incapacity to be swayed by sordid\r\nconsiderations, I should not venture to believe the transaction advanced me one\r\nstep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John,\u201d I began, \u201cLove is blind;\u201d but just then a blue subtle ray sped\r\nsideways from Dr. John\u2019s eye: it reminded me of old days, it reminded me of his\r\npicture: it half led me to think that part, at least, of his professed\r\npersuasion of Miss Fanshawe\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 was assumed; it led me dubiously\r\nto conjecture that perhaps, in spite of his passion for her beauty, his\r\nappreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken, more\r\nclear-sighted, than from his general language was presumable. After all it\r\nmight be only a chance look, or at best the token of a merely momentary\r\nimpression. Chance or intentional real or imaginary, it closed the\r\nconversation.\r\n\n"}
{"20": "\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE CLEOPATRA.\n\r\nMy stay at La Terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of the\r\nvacation. Mrs. Bretton\u2019s kind management procured me this respite. Her son\r\nhaving one day delivered the dictum that \u201cLucy was not yet strong enough to go\r\nback to that den of a pensionnat,\u201d she at once drove over to the Rue Fossette,\r\nhad an interview with the directress, and procured the indulgence, on the plea\r\nof prolonged rest and change being necessary to perfect recovery. Hereupon,\r\nhowever, followed an attention I could very well have dispensed with, viz.\u2014a\r\npolite call from Madame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nThat lady\u2014one fine day\u2014actually came out in a fiacre as far as the ch\u00e2teau. I\r\nsuppose she had resolved within herself to see what manner of place Dr. John\r\ninhabited. Apparently, the pleasant site and neat interior surpassed her\r\nexpectations; she eulogized all she saw, pronounced the blue salon \u201cune pi\u00e8ce\r\nmagnifique,\u201d profusely congratulated me on the acquisition of friends,\r\n\u201ctellement dignes, aimables, et respectables,\u201d turned also a neat compliment in\r\nmy favour, and, upon Dr. John coming in, ran up to him with the utmost\r\nbuoyancy, opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language, all sparkling\r\nwith felicitations and protestations about his \u201cch\u00e2teau,\u201d\u2014\u201cmadame sa m\u00e8re, la\r\ndigne ch\u00e2telaine:\u201d also his looks; which, indeed, were very flourishing, and at\r\nthe moment additionally embellished by the good-natured but amused smile with\r\nwhich he always listened to Madame\u2019s fluent and florid French. In short, Madame\r\nshone in her very best phase that day, and came in and went out quite a living\r\ncatherine-wheel of compliments, delight, and affability. Half purposely, and\r\nhalf to ask some question about school-business, I followed her to the\r\ncarriage, and looked in after she was seated and the door closed. In that brief\r\nfraction of time what a change had been wrought! An instant ago, all sparkles\r\nand jests, she now sat sterner than a judge and graver than a sage. Strange\r\nlittle woman!\r\n\n\r\nI went back and teased Dr. John about Madame\u2019s devotion to him. How he laughed!\r\nWhat fun shone in his eyes as he recalled some of her fine speeches, and\r\nrepeated them, imitating her voluble delivery! He had an acute sense of humour,\r\nand was the finest company in the world\u2014when he could forget Miss Fanshawe.\r\n\n\r\nTo \u201csit in sunshine calm and sweet\u201d is said to be excellent for weak people; it\r\ngives them vital force. When little Georgette Beck was recovering from her\r\nillness, I used to take her in my arms and walk with her in the garden by the\r\nhour together, beneath a certain wall hung with grapes, which the Southern sun\r\nwas ripening: that sun cherished her little pale frame quite as effectually as\r\nit mellowed and swelled the clustering fruit.\r\n\n\r\nThere are human tempers, bland, glowing, and genial, within whose influence it\r\nis as good for the poor in spirit to live, as it is for the feeble in frame to\r\nbask in the glow of noon. Of the number of these choice natures were certainly\r\nboth Dr. Bretton\u2019s and his mother\u2019s. They liked to communicate happiness, as\r\nsome like to occasion misery: they did it instinctively; without fuss, and\r\napparently with little consciousness; the means to give pleasure rose\r\nspontaneously in their minds. Every day while I stayed with them, some little\r\nplan was proposed which resulted in beneficial enjoyment. Fully occupied as was\r\nDr. John\u2019s time, he still made it in his way to accompany us in each brief\r\nexcursion. I can hardly tell how he managed his engagements; they were\r\nnumerous, yet by dint of system, he classed them in an order which left him a\r\ndaily period of liberty. I often saw him hard-worked, yet seldom over-driven,\r\nand never irritated, confused, or oppressed. What he did was accomplished with\r\nthe ease and grace of all-sufficing strength; with the bountiful cheerfulness\r\nof high and unbroken energies. Under his guidance I saw, in that one happy\r\nfortnight, more of Villette, its environs, and its inhabitants, than I had seen\r\nin the whole eight months of my previous residence. He took me to places of\r\ninterest in the town, of whose names I had not before so much as heard; with\r\nwillingness and spirit he communicated much noteworthy information. He never\r\nseemed to think it a trouble to talk to me, and, I am sure, it was never a task\r\nto me to listen. It was not his way to treat subjects coldly and vaguely; he\r\nrarely generalized, never prosed. He seemed to like nice details almost as much\r\nas I liked them myself: he seemed observant of character: and not superficially\r\nobservant, either. These points gave the quality of interest to his discourse;\r\nand the fact of his speaking direct from his own resources, and not borrowing\r\nor stealing from books\u2014here a dry fact, and there a trite phrase, and elsewhere\r\na hackneyed opinion\u2014ensured a freshness, as welcome as it was rare. Before my\r\neyes, too, his disposition seemed to unfold another phase; to pass to a fresh\r\nday: to rise in new and nobler dawn.\r\n\n\r\nHis mother possessed a good development of benevolence, but he owned a better\r\nand larger. I found, on accompanying him to the Basse-Ville\u2014the poor and\r\ncrowded quarter of the city\u2014that his errands there were as much those of the\r\nphilanthropist as the physician. I understood presently that cheerfully,\r\nhabitually, and in single-minded unconsciousness of any special merit\r\ndistinguishing his deeds\u2014he was achieving, amongst a very wretched population,\r\na world of active good. The lower orders liked him well; his poor patients in\r\nthe hospitals welcomed him with a sort of enthusiasm.\r\n\n\r\nBut stop\u2014I must not, from the faithful narrator, degenerate into the partial\r\neulogist. Well, full well, do I know that Dr. John was not perfect, any more\r\nthan I am perfect. Human fallibility leavened him throughout: there was no\r\nhour, and scarcely a moment of the time I spent with him that in act or speech,\r\nor look, he did not betray something that was not of a god. A god could not\r\nhave the cruel vanity of Dr. John, nor his sometime levity. No immortal could\r\nhave resembled him in his occasional temporary oblivion of all but the\r\npresent\u2014in his passing passion for that present; shown not coarsely, by\r\ndevoting it to material indulgence, but selfishly, by extracting from it\r\nwhatever it could yield of nutriment to his masculine self-love: his delight\r\nwas to feed that ravenous sentiment, without thought of the price of provender,\r\nor care for the cost of keeping it sleek and high-pampered.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader is requested to note a seeming contradiction in the two views which\r\nhave been given of Graham Bretton\u2014the public and private\u2014the out-door and the\r\nin-door view. In the first, the public, he is shown oblivious of self; as\r\nmodest in the display of his energies, as earnest in their exercise. In the\r\nsecond, the fireside picture, there is expressed consciousness of what he has\r\nand what he is; pleasure in homage, some recklessness in exciting, some vanity\r\nin receiving the same. Both portraits are correct.\r\n\n\r\nIt was hardly possible to oblige Dr. John quietly and in secret. When you\r\nthought that the fabrication of some trifle dedicated to his use had been\r\nachieved unnoticed, and that, like other men, he would use it when placed ready\r\nfor his use, and never ask whence it came, he amazed you by a smilingly-uttered\r\nobservation or two, proving that his eye had been on the work from commencement\r\nto close: that he had noted the design, traced its progress, and marked its\r\ncompletion. It pleased him to be thus served, and he let his pleasure beam in\r\nhis eye and play about his mouth.\r\n\n\r\nThis would have been all very well, if he had not added to such kindly and\r\nunobtrusive evidence a certain wilfulness in discharging what he called debts.\r\nWhen his mother worked for him, he paid her by showering about her his bright\r\nanimal spirits, with even more affluence than his gay, taunting, teasing,\r\nloving wont. If Lucy Snowe were discovered to have put her hand to such work,\r\nhe planned, in recompence, some pleasant recreation.\r\n\n\r\nI often felt amazed at his perfect knowledge of Villette; a knowledge not\r\nmerely confined to its open streets, but penetrating to all its galleries,\r\nsalles, and cabinets: of every door which shut in an object worth seeing, of\r\nevery museum, of every hall, sacred to art or science, he seemed to possess the\r\n\u201cOpen! Sesame.\u201d I never had a head for science, but an ignorant, blind, fond\r\ninstinct inclined me to art. I liked to visit the picture-galleries, and I\r\ndearly liked to be left there alone. In company, a wretched idiosyncracy\r\nforbade me to see much or to feel anything. In unfamiliar company, where it was\r\nnecessary to maintain a flow of talk on the subjects in presence, half an hour\r\nwould knock me up, with a combined pressure of physical lassitude and entire\r\nmental incapacity. I never yet saw the well-reared child, much less the\r\neducated adult, who could not put me to shame, by the sustained intelligence of\r\nits demeanour under the ordeal of a conversable, sociable visitation of\r\npictures, historical sights or buildings, or any lions of public interest. Dr.\r\nBretton was a cicerone after my own heart; he would take me betimes, ere the\r\ngalleries were filled, leave me there for two or three hours, and call for me\r\nwhen his own engagements were discharged. Meantime, I was happy; happy, not\r\nalways in admiring, but in examining, questioning, and forming conclusions. In\r\nthe commencement of these visits, there was some misunderstanding and\r\nconsequent struggle between Will and Power. The former faculty exacted\r\napprobation of that which it was considered orthodox to admire; the latter\r\ngroaned forth its utter inability to pay the tax; it was then self-sneered at,\r\nspurred up, goaded on to refine its taste, and whet its zest. The more it was\r\nchidden, however, the more it wouldn\u2019t praise. Discovering gradually that a\r\nwonderful sense of fatigue resulted from these conscientious efforts, I began\r\nto reflect whether I might not dispense with that great labour, and concluded\r\neventually that I might, and so sank supine into a luxury of calm before\r\nninety-nine out of a hundred of the exhibited frames.\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed to me that an original and good picture was just as scarce as an\r\noriginal and good book; nor did I, in the end, tremble to say to myself,\r\nstanding before certain chef-d\u2019\u0153uvres bearing great names, \u201cThese are\r\nnot a whit like nature. Nature\u2019s daylight never had that colour: never was made\r\nso turbid, either by storm or cloud, as it is laid out there, under a sky of\r\nindigo: and that indigo is not ether; and those dark weeds plastered upon it\r\nare not trees.\u201d Several very well executed and complacent-looking fat women\r\nstruck me as by no means the goddesses they appeared to consider themselves.\r\nMany scores of marvellously-finished little Flemish pictures, and also of\r\nsketches, excellent for fashion-books displaying varied costumes in the\r\nhandsomest materials, gave evidence of laudable industry whimsically applied.\r\nAnd yet there were fragments of truth here and there which satisfied the\r\nconscience, and gleams of light that cheered the vision. Nature\u2019s power here\r\nbroke through in a mountain snow-storm; and there her glory in a sunny southern\r\nday. An expression in this portrait proved clear insight into character; a face\r\nin that historical painting, by its vivid filial likeness, startlingly reminded\r\nyou that genius gave it birth. These exceptions I loved: they grew dear as\r\nfriends.\r\n\n\r\nOne day, at a quiet early hour, I found myself nearly alone in a certain\r\ngallery, wherein one particular picture of portentous size, set up in the best\r\nlight, having a cordon of protection stretched before it, and a cushioned bench\r\nduly set in front for the accommodation of worshipping connoisseurs, who,\r\nhaving gazed themselves off their feet, might be fain to complete the business\r\nsitting: this picture, I say, seemed to consider itself the queen of the\r\ncollection.\r\n\n\r\nIt represented a woman, considerably larger, I thought, than the life. I\r\ncalculated that this lady, put into a scale of magnitude, suitable for the\r\nreception of a commodity of bulk, would infallibly turn from fourteen to\r\nsixteen stone. She was, indeed, extremely well fed: very much butcher\u2019s meat\u2014to\r\nsay nothing of bread, vegetables, and liquids\u2014must she have consumed to attain\r\nthat breadth and height, that wealth of muscle, that affluence of flesh. She\r\nlay half-reclined on a couch: why, it would be difficult to say; broad daylight\r\nblazed round her; she appeared in hearty health, strong enough to do the work\r\nof two plain cooks; she could not plead a weak spine; she ought to have been\r\nstanding, or at least sitting bolt upright. She, had no business to lounge away\r\nthe noon on a sofa. She ought likewise to have worn decent garments; a gown\r\ncovering her properly, which was not the case: out of abundance of\r\nmaterial\u2014seven-and-twenty yards, I should say, of drapery\u2014she managed to make\r\ninefficient raiment. Then, for the wretched untidiness surrounding her, there\r\ncould be no excuse. Pots and pans\u2014perhaps I ought to say vases and goblets\u2014were\r\nrolled here and there on the foreground; a perfect rubbish of flowers was mixed\r\namongst them, and an absurd and disorderly mass of curtain upholstery smothered\r\nthe couch and cumbered the floor. On referring to the catalogue, I found that\r\nthis notable production bore the name \u201cCleopatra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWell, I was sitting wondering at it (as the bench was there, I thought I might\r\nas well take advantage of its accommodation), and thinking that while some of\r\nthe details\u2014as roses, gold cups, jewels, &c., were very prettily painted,\r\nit was on the whole an enormous piece of claptrap; the room, almost vacant when\r\nI entered, began to fill. Scarcely noticing this circumstance (as, indeed, it\r\ndid not matter to me) I retained my seat; rather to rest myself than with a\r\nview to studying this huge, dark-complexioned gipsy-queen; of whom, indeed, I\r\nsoon tired, and betook myself for refreshment to the contemplation of some\r\nexquisite little pictures of still life: wild-flowers, wild-fruit, mossy\r\nwood-nests, casketing eggs that looked like pearls seen through clear green\r\nsea-water; all hung modestly beneath that coarse and preposterous canvas.\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly a light tap visited my shoulder. Starting, turning, I met a face bent\r\nto encounter mine; a frowning, almost a shocked face it was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue faites-vous ici?\u201d said a voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur, je m\u2019amuse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous vous amusez! et \u00e0 quoi, s\u2019il vous plait? Mais d\u2019abord, faites-moi le\r\nplaisir de vous lever; prenez mon bras, et allons de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did precisely as I was bid. M. Paul Emanuel (it was he) returned from Rome,\r\nand now a travelled man, was not likely to be less tolerant of insubordination\r\nnow, than before this added distinction laurelled his temples.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to conduct you to your party,\u201d said he, as we crossed the room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have no party.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are not alone?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you come here unaccompanied?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur. Dr. Bretton brought me here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton and Madame his mother, of course?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; only Dr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he told you to look at that picture?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means; I found it out for myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul\u2019s hair was shorn close as raven down, or I think it would have bristled\r\non his head. Beginning now to perceive his drift, I had a certain pleasure in\r\nkeeping cool, and working him up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAstounding insular audacity!\u201d cried the Professor. \u201cSinguli\u00e8res femmes que ces\r\nAnglaises!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMatter! How dare you, a young person, sit coolly down, with the\r\nself-possession of a gar\u00e7on, and look at that picture?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a very ugly picture, but I cannot at all see why I should not look at\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! bon! Speak no more of it. But you ought not to be here alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf, however, I have no society\u2014no party, as you say? And then, what\r\ndoes it signify whether I am alone, or accompanied? nobody meddles with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTaisez-vous, et asseyez-vous l\u00e0\u2014l\u00e0!\u201d\u2014setting down a chair with emphasis in a\r\nparticularly dull corner, before a series of most specially dreary \u201ccadres.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Mademoiselle, asseyez-vous, et ne bougez pas\u2014entendez-vous?\u2014jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce\r\nqu\u2019on vienne vous chercher, ou que je vous donne la permission.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuel triste coin!\u201d cried I, \u201cet quelles laids tableaux!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd \u201claids,\u201d indeed, they were; being a set of four, denominated in the\r\ncatalogue \u201cLa vie d\u2019une femme.\u201d They were painted rather in a remarkable\r\nstyle\u2014flat, dead, pale, and formal. The first represented a \u201cJeune Fille,\u201d\r\ncoming out of a church-door, a missal in her hand, her dress very prim, her\r\neyes cast down, her mouth pursed up\u2014the image of a most villanous little\r\nprecocious she-hypocrite. The second, a \u201cMari\u00e9e,\u201d with a long white veil,\r\nkneeling at a prie-dieu in her chamber, holding her hands plastered together,\r\nfinger to finger, and showing the whites of her eyes in a most exasperating\r\nmanner. The third, a \u201cJeune M\u00e8re,\u201d hanging disconsolate over a clayey and puffy\r\nbaby with a face like an unwholesome full moon. The fourth, a \u201cVeuve,\u201d being a\r\nblack woman, holding by the hand a black little girl, and the twain studiously\r\nsurveying an elegant French monument, set up in a corner of some P\u00e8re la\r\nChaise. All these four \u201cAnges\u201d were grim and grey as burglars, and cold and\r\nvapid as ghosts. What women to live with! insincere, ill-humoured, bloodless,\r\nbrainless nonentities! As bad in their way as the indolent gipsy-giantess, the\r\nCleopatra, in hers.\r\n\n\r\nIt was impossible to keep one\u2019s attention long confined to these master-pieces,\r\nand so, by degrees, I veered round, and surveyed the gallery.\r\n\n\r\nA perfect crowd of spectators was by this time gathered round the Lioness, from\r\nwhose vicinage I had been banished; nearly half this crowd were ladies, but M.\r\nPaul afterwards told me, these were \u201cdes dames,\u201d and it was quite proper for\r\nthem to contemplate what no \u201cdemoiselle\u201d ought to glance at. I assured him\r\nplainly I could not agree in this doctrine, and did not see the sense of it;\r\nwhereupon, with his usual absolutism, he merely requested my silence, and also,\r\nin the same breath, denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance. A more\r\ndespotic little man than M. Paul never filled a professor\u2019s chair. I noticed,\r\nby the way, that he looked at the picture himself quite at his ease, and for a\r\nvery long while: he did not, however, neglect to glance from time to time my\r\nway, in order, I suppose, to make sure that I was obeying orders, and not\r\nbreaking bounds. By-and-by, he again accosted me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad I not been ill?\u201d he wished to know: \u201che understood I had.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I was now quite well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere had I spent the vacation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChiefly in the Rue Fossette; partly with Madame Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe had heard that I was left alone in the Rue Fossette; was that so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot quite alone: Marie Broc\u201d (the cr\u00e9tin) \u201cwas with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders; varied and contradictory expressions played rapidly\r\nover his countenance. Marie Broc was well known to M. Paul; he never gave a\r\nlesson in the third division (containing the least advanced pupils), that she\r\ndid not occasion in him a sharp conflict between antagonistic impressions. Her\r\npersonal appearance, her repulsive manners, her often unmanageable disposition,\r\nirritated his temper, and inspired him with strong antipathy; a feeling he was\r\ntoo apt to conceive when his taste was offended or his will thwarted. On the\r\nother hand, her misfortunes, constituted a strong claim on his forbearance and\r\ncompassion\u2014such a claim as it was not in his nature to deny; hence resulted\r\nalmost daily drawn battles between impatience and disgust on the one hand, pity\r\nand a sense of justice on the other; in which, to his credit be it said, it was\r\nvery seldom that the former feelings prevailed: when they did, however, M. Paul\r\nshowed a phase of character which had its terrors. His passions were strong,\r\nhis aversions and attachments alike vivid; the force he exerted in holding both\r\nin check by no means mitigated an observer\u2019s sense of their vehemence. With\r\nsuch tendencies, it may well be supposed he often excited in ordinary minds\r\nfear and dislike; yet it was an error to fear him: nothing drove him so nearly\r\nfrantic as the tremor of an apprehensive and distrustful spirit; nothing\r\nsoothed him like confidence tempered with gentleness. To evince these\r\nsentiments, however, required a thorough comprehension of his nature; and his\r\nnature was of an order rarely comprehended.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get on with Marie Broc?\u201d he asked, after some minutes\u2019 silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I did my best; but it was terrible to be alone with her!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have, then, a weak heart! You lack courage; and, perhaps, charity. Yours\r\nare not the qualities which might constitute a Sister of Mercy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n[He was a religious little man, in his way: the self-denying and\r\nself-sacrificing part of the Catholic religion commanded the homage of his\r\nsoul.]\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, indeed: I took as good care of her as I could; but when her aunt\r\ncame to fetch her away, it was a great relief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you are an egotist. There are women who have nursed hospitals-full of\r\nsimilar unfortunates. You could not do that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould Monsieur do it himself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWomen who are worthy the name ought infinitely to surpass; our coarse,\r\nfallible, self-indulgent sex, in the power to perform such duties.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI washed her, I kept her clean, I fed her, I tried to amuse her; but she made\r\nmouths at me instead of speaking.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think you did great things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; but as great as I could do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen limited are your powers, for in tending one idiot you fell sick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot with that, Monsieur; I had a nervous fever: my mind was ill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVraiment! Vous valez peu de chose. You are not cast in an heroic mould; your\r\ncourage will not avail to sustain you in solitude; it merely gives you the\r\ntemerity to gaze with sang-froid at pictures of Cleopatra.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to show anger at the teasing, hostile tone of the\r\nlittle man. I had never been angry with him yet, however, and had no present\r\ndisposition to begin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCleopatra!\u201d I repeated, quietly. \u201cMonsieur, too, has been looking at\r\nCleopatra; what does he think of her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCela ne vaut rien,\u201d he responded. \u201cUne femme superbe\u2014une taille d\u2019imp\u00e9ratrice,\r\ndes formes de Junon, mais une personne dont je ne voudrais ni pour femme, ni\r\npour fille, ni pour s\u0153ur. Aussi vous ne jeterez plus un seul coup d\u2019oeil de sa\r\nc\u00f4t\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I have looked at her a great many times while Monsieur has been talking: I\r\ncan see her quite well from this corner.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTurn to the wall and study your four pictures of a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, M. Paul; they are too hideous: but if you admire them, allow me to\r\nvacate my seat and leave you to their contemplation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d he said, grimacing a half-smile, or what he intended for a\r\nsmile, though it was but a grim and hurried manifestation. \u201cYou nurslings of\r\nProtestantism astonish me. You unguarded Englishwomen walk calmly amidst\r\nred-hot ploughshares and escape burning. I believe, if some of you were thrown\r\ninto Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s hottest furnace you would issue forth untraversed by the\r\nsmell of fire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill Monsieur have the goodness to move an inch to one side?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow! At what are you gazing now? You are not recognising an acquaintance\r\namongst that group of jeunes gens?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so\u2014Yes, I see there a person I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn fact, I had caught a glimpse of a head too pretty to belong to any other\r\nthan the redoubted Colonel de Hamal. What a very finished, highly polished\r\nlittle pate it was! What a figure, so trim and natty! What womanish feet and\r\nhands! How daintily he held a glass to one of his optics! with what admiration\r\nhe gazed upon the Cleopatra! and then, how engagingly he tittered and whispered\r\na friend at his elbow! Oh, the man of sense! Oh, the refined gentleman of\r\nsuperior taste and tact! I observed him for about ten minutes, and perceived\r\nthat he was exceedingly taken with this dusk and portly Venus of the Nile. So\r\nmuch was I interested in his bearing, so absorbed in divining his character by\r\nhis looks and movements, I temporarily forgot M. Paul; in the interim a group\r\ncame between that gentleman and me; or possibly his scruples might have\r\nreceived another and worse shock from my present abstraction, causing him to\r\nwithdraw voluntarily: at any rate, when I again looked round, he was gone.\r\n\n\r\nMy eye, pursuant of the search, met not him, but another and dissimilar figure,\r\nwell seen amidst the crowd, for the height as well as the port lent each its\r\ndistinction. This way came Dr. John, in visage, in shape, in hue, as unlike the\r\ndark, acerb, and caustic little professor, as the fruit of the Hesperides might\r\nbe unlike the sloe in the wild thicket; as the high-couraged but tractable\r\nArabian is unlike the rude and stubborn \u201csheltie.\u201d He was looking for me, but\r\nhad not yet explored the corner where the schoolmaster had just put me. I\r\nremained quiet; yet another minute I would watch.\r\n\n\r\nHe approached de Hamal; he paused near him; I thought he had a pleasure in\r\nlooking over his head; Dr. Bretton, too, gazed on the Cleopatra. I doubt if it\r\nwere to his taste: he did not simper like the little Count; his mouth looked\r\nfastidious, his eye cool; without demonstration he stepped aside, leaving room\r\nfor others to approach. I saw now that he was waiting, and, rising, I joined\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nWe took one turn round the gallery; with Graham it was very pleasant to take\r\nsuch a turn. I always liked dearly to hear what he had to say about either\r\npictures or books; because without pretending to be a connoisseur, he always\r\nspoke his thought, and that was sure to be fresh: very often it was also just\r\nand pithy. It was pleasant also to tell him some things he did not know\u2014he\r\nlistened so kindly, so teachably; unformalized by scruples lest so to bend his\r\nbright handsome head, to gather a woman\u2019s rather obscure and stammering\r\nexplanation, should imperil the dignity of his manhood. And when he\r\ncommunicated information in return, it was with a lucid intelligence that left\r\nall his words clear graven on the memory; no explanation of his giving, no fact\r\nof his narrating, did I ever forget.\r\n\n\r\nAs we left the gallery, I asked him what he thought of the Cleopatra (after\r\nmaking him laugh by telling him how Professor Emanuel had sent me to the right\r\nabout, and taking him to see the sweet series of pictures recommended to my\r\nattention.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh!\u201d said he. \u201cMy mother is a better-looking woman. I heard some French\r\nfops, yonder, designating her as \u2018le type du voluptueux;\u2019 if so, I can only\r\nsay, \u2018le voluptueux\u2019 is little to my liking. Compare that mulatto with\r\nGinevra!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"21": "\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE CONCERT.\n\r\nOne morning, Mrs. Bretton, coming promptly into my room, desired me to open my\r\ndrawers and show her my dresses; which I did, without a word.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said she, when she had turned them over. \u201cYou must have a new\r\none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe went out. She returned presently with a dressmaker. She had me measured. \u201cI\r\nmean,\u201d said she, \u201cto follow my own taste, and to have my own way in this little\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTwo days after came home\u2014a pink dress!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is not for me,\u201d I said, hurriedly, feeling that I would almost as soon\r\nclothe myself in the costume of a Chinese lady of rank.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see whether it is for you or not,\u201d rejoined my godmother, adding with\r\nher resistless decision: \u201cMark my words. You will wear it this very evening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought I should not; I thought no human force should avail to put me into\r\nit. A pink dress! I knew it not. It knew not me. I had not proved it.\r\n\n\r\nMy godmother went on to decree that I was to go with her and Graham to a\r\nconcert that same night: which concert, she explained, was a grand affair to be\r\nheld in the large salle, or hall, of the principal musical society. The most\r\nadvanced of the pupils of the Conservatoire were to perform: it was to be\r\nfollowed by a lottery \u201cau b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pauvres;\u201d and to crown all, the King,\r\nQueen, and Prince of Labassecour were to be present. Graham, in sending\r\ntickets, had enjoined attention to costume as a compliment due to royalty: he\r\nalso recommended punctual readiness by seven o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nAbout six, I was ushered upstairs. Without any force at all, I found myself led\r\nand influenced by another\u2019s will, unconsulted, unpersuaded, quietly overruled.\r\nIn short, the pink dress went on, softened by some drapery of black lace. I was\r\npronounced to be en grande tenue, and requested to look in the glass. I did so\r\nwith some fear and trembling; with more fear and trembling, I turned away.\r\nSeven o\u2019clock struck; Dr. Bretton was come; my godmother and I went down.\r\nShe was clad in brown velvet; as I walked in her shadow, how I envied\r\nher those folds of grave, dark majesty! Graham stood in the drawing-room\r\ndoorway.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do hope he will not think I have been decking myself out to draw\r\nattention,\u201d was my uneasy aspiration.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere, Lucy, are some flowers,\u201d said he, giving me a bouquet. He took no\r\nfurther notice of my dress than was conveyed in a kind smile and satisfied nod,\r\nwhich calmed at once my sense of shame and fear of ridicule. For the rest; the\r\ndress was made with extreme simplicity, guiltless of flounce or furbelow; it\r\nwas but the light fabric and bright tint which scared me, and since Graham\r\nfound in it nothing absurd, my own eye consented soon to become reconciled.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose people who go every night to places of public amusement, can hardly\r\nenter into the fresh gala feeling with which an opera or a concert is enjoyed\r\nby those for whom it is a rarity: I am not sure that I expected great pleasure\r\nfrom the concert, having but a very vague notion of its nature, but I liked the\r\ndrive there well. The snug comfort of the close carriage on a cold though fine\r\nnight, the pleasure of setting out with companions so cheerful and friendly,\r\nthe sight of the stars glinting fitfully through the trees as we rolled along\r\nthe avenue; then the freer burst of the night-sky when we issued forth to the\r\nopen chauss\u00e9e, the passage through the city gates, the lights there burning,\r\nthe guards there posted, the pretence of inspection, to which we there\r\nsubmitted, and which amused us so much\u2014all these small matters had for me, in\r\ntheir novelty, a peculiarly exhilarating charm. How much of it lay in the\r\natmosphere of friendship diffused about me, I know not: Dr. John and his mother\r\nwere both in their finest mood, contending animatedly with each other the whole\r\nway, and as frankly kind to me as if I had been of their kin.\r\n\n\r\nOur way lay through some of the best streets of Villette, streets brightly lit,\r\nand far more lively now than at high noon. How brilliant seemed the shops! How\r\nglad, gay, and abundant flowed the tide of life along the broad pavement! While\r\nI looked, the thought of the Rue Fossette came across me\u2014of the walled-in\r\ngarden and school-house, and of the dark, vast \u201cclasses,\u201d where, as at this\r\nvery hour, it was my wont to wander all solitary, gazing at the stars through\r\nthe high, blindless windows, and listening to the distant voice of the reader\r\nin the refectory, monotonously exercised upon the \u201clecture pieuse.\u201d Thus must I\r\nsoon again listen and wander; and this shadow of the future stole with timely\r\nsobriety across the radiant present.\r\n\n\r\nBy this time we had got into a current of carriages all tending in one\r\ndirection, and soon the front of a great illuminated building blazed before us.\r\nOf what I should see within this building, I had, as before intimated, but an\r\nimperfect idea; for no place of public entertainment had it ever been my lot to\r\nenter yet.\r\n\n\r\nWe alighted under a portico where there was a great bustle and a great crowd,\r\nbut I do not distinctly remember further details, until I found myself mounting\r\na majestic staircase wide and easy of ascent, deeply and softly carpeted with\r\ncrimson, leading up to great doors closed solemnly, and whose panels were also\r\ncrimson-clothed.\r\n\n\r\nI hardly noticed by what magic these doors were made to roll back\u2014Dr. John\r\nmanaged these points; roll back they did, however, and within was disclosed a\r\nhall\u2014grand, wide, and high, whose sweeping circular walls, and domed hollow\r\nceiling, seemed to me all dead gold (thus with nice art was it stained),\r\nrelieved by cornicing, fluting, and garlandry, either bright, like gold\r\nburnished, or snow-white, like alabaster, or white and gold mingled in wreaths\r\nof gilded leaves and spotless lilies: wherever drapery hung, wherever carpets\r\nwere spread, or cushions placed, the sole colour employed was deep crimson.\r\nPendent from the dome, flamed a mass that dazzled me\u2014a mass, I thought, of\r\nrock-crystal, sparkling with facets, streaming with drops, ablaze with stars,\r\nand gorgeously tinged with dews of gems dissolved, or fragments of rainbows\r\nshivered. It was only the chandelier, reader, but for me it seemed the work of\r\neastern genii: I almost looked to see if a huge, dark, cloudy hand\u2014that of the\r\nSlave of the Lamp\u2014were not hovering in the lustrous and perfumed atmosphere of\r\nthe cupola, guarding its wondrous treasure.\r\n\n\r\nWe moved on\u2014I was not at all conscious whither\u2014but at some turn we suddenly\r\nencountered another party approaching from the opposite direction. I just now\r\nsee that group, as it flashed\u2014upon me for one moment. A handsome middle-aged\r\nlady in dark velvet; a gentleman who might be her son\u2014the best face, the finest\r\nfigure, I thought, I had ever seen; a third person in a pink dress and black\r\nlace mantle.\r\n\n\r\nI noted them all\u2014the third person as well as the other two\u2014and for the fraction\r\nof a moment believed them all strangers, thus receiving an impartial impression\r\nof their appearance. But the impression was hardly felt and not fixed, before\r\nthe consciousness that I faced a great mirror, filling a compartment between\r\ntwo pillars, dispelled it: the party was our own party. Thus for the first, and\r\nperhaps only time in my life, I enjoyed the \u201cgiftie\u201d of seeing myself as others\r\nsee me. No need to dwell on the result. It brought a jar of discord, a pang of\r\nregret; it was not flattering, yet, after all, I ought to be thankful; it might\r\nhave been worse.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, we were seated in places commanding a good general view of that vast\r\nand dazzling, but warm and cheerful hall. Already it was filled, and filled\r\nwith a splendid assemblage. I do not know that the women were very beautiful,\r\nbut their dresses were so perfect; and foreigners, even such as are ungraceful\r\nin domestic privacy, seem to possess the art of appearing graceful in public:\r\nhowever blunt and boisterous those every-day and home movements connected with\r\npeignoir and papillotes, there is a slide, a bend, a carriage of the head and\r\narms, a mien of the mouth and eyes, kept nicely in reserve for gala use\u2014always\r\nbrought out with the grande toilette, and duly put on with the \u201cparure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSome fine forms there were here and there, models of a peculiar style of\r\nbeauty; a style, I think, never seen in England; a solid, firm-set, sculptural\r\nstyle. These shapes have no angles: a caryatid in marble is almost as flexible;\r\na Phidian goddess is not more perfect in a certain still and stately sort. They\r\nhave such features as the Dutch painters give to their madonnas: low-country\r\nclassic features, regular but round, straight but stolid; and for their depth\r\nof expressionless calm, of passionless peace, a polar snow-field could alone\r\noffer a type. Women of this order need no ornament, and they seldom wear any;\r\nthe smooth hair, closely braided, supplies a sufficient contrast to the\r\nsmoother cheek and brow; the dress cannot be too simple; the rounded arm and\r\nperfect neck require neither bracelet nor chain.\r\n\n\r\nWith one of these beauties I once had the honour and rapture to be perfectly\r\nacquainted: the inert force of the deep, settled love she bore herself, was\r\nwonderful; it could only be surpassed by her proud impotency to care for any\r\nother living thing. Of blood, her cool veins conducted no flow; placid lymph\r\nfilled and almost obstructed her arteries.\r\n\n\r\nSuch a Juno as I have described sat full in our view\u2014a sort of mark for all\r\neyes, and quite conscious that so she was, but proof to the magnetic influence\r\nof gaze or glance: cold, rounded, blonde, and beauteous as the white column,\r\ncapitalled with gilding, which rose at her side.\r\n\n\r\nObserving that Dr. John\u2019s attention was much drawn towards her, I entreated him\r\nin a low voice \u201cfor the love of heaven to shield well his heart. You need not\r\nfall in love with that lady,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause, I tell you beforehand,\r\nyou might die at her feet, and she would not love you again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said he, \u201cand how do you know that the spectacle of her grand\r\ninsensibility might not with me be the strongest stimulus to homage? The sting\r\nof desperation is, I think, a wonderful irritant to my emotions: but\u201d\r\n(shrugging his shoulders) \u201cyou know nothing about these things; I\u2019ll address\r\nmyself to my mother. Mamma, I\u2019m in a dangerous way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if that interested me!\u201d said Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAlas! the cruelty of my lot!\u201d responded her son. \u201cNever man had a more\r\nunsentimental mother than mine: she never seems to think that such a calamity\r\ncan befall her as a daughter-in-law.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t, it is not for want of having that same calamity held over my head:\r\nyou have threatened me with it for the last ten years. \u2018Mamma, I am going to be\r\nmarried soon!\u2019 was the cry before you were well out of jackets.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, mother, one of these days it will be realized. All of a sudden, when you\r\nthink you are most secure, I shall go forth like Jacob or Esau, or any other\r\npatriarch, and take me a wife: perhaps of these which are of the daughters of\r\nthe land.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt your peril, John Graham! that is all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis mother of mine means me to be an old bachelor. What a jealous old lady it\r\nis! But now just look at that splendid creature in the pale blue satin dress,\r\nand hair of paler brown, with \u2018reflets satin\u00e9s\u2019 as those of her robe. Would you\r\nnot feel proud, mamma, if I were to bring that goddess home some day, and\r\nintroduce her to you as Mrs. Bretton, junior?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will bring no goddess to La Terrasse: that little ch\u00e2teau will not contain\r\ntwo mistresses; especially if the second be of the height, bulk, and\r\ncircumference of that mighty doll in wood and wax, and kid and satin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMamma, she would fill your blue chair so admirably!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFill my chair? I defy the foreign usurper! a rueful chair should it be for\r\nher: but hush, John Graham! Hold your tongue, and use your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDuring the above skirmish, the hall, which, I had thought, seemed full at the\r\nentrance, continued to admit party after party, until the semicircle before the\r\nstage presented one dense mass of heads, sloping from floor to ceiling. The\r\nstage, too, or rather the wide temporary platform, larger than any stage,\r\ndesert half an hour since, was now overflowing with life; round two grand\r\npianos, placed about the centre, a white flock of young girls, the pupils of\r\nthe Conservatoire, had noiselessly poured. I had noticed their gathering, while\r\nGraham and his mother were engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin, and\r\nhad watched with interest the process of arraying and marshalling them. Two\r\ngentlemen, in each of whom I recognised an acquaintance, officered this virgin\r\ntroop. One, an artistic-looking man, bearded, and with long hair, was a noted\r\npianiste, and also the first music-teacher in Villette; he attended twice a\r\nweek at Madame Beck\u2019s pensionnat, to give lessons to the few pupils whose\r\nparents were rich enough to allow their daughters the privilege of his\r\ninstructions; his name was M. Josef Emanuel, and he was half-brother to M.\r\nPaul: which potent personage was now visible in the person of the second\r\ngentleman.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul amused me; I smiled to myself as I watched him, he seemed so thoroughly\r\nin his element\u2014standing conspicuous in presence of a wide and grand assemblage,\r\narranging, restraining, over-aweing about one hundred young ladies. He was,\r\ntoo, so perfectly in earnest\u2014so energetic, so intent, and, above all, so\r\nabsolute: and yet what business had he there? What had he to do with music or\r\nthe Conservatoire\u2014he who could hardly distinguish one note from another? I knew\r\nthat it was his love of display and authority which had brought him there\u2014a\r\nlove not offensive, only because so naive. It presently became obvious that his\r\nbrother, M. Josef, was as much under his control as were the girls themselves.\r\nNever was such a little hawk of a man as that M. Paul! Ere long, some noted\r\nsingers and musicians dawned upon the platform: as these stars rose, the\r\ncomet-like professor set. Insufferable to him were all notorieties and\r\ncelebrities: where he could not outshine, he fled.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now all was prepared: but one compartment of the hall waited to be filled\u2014a\r\ncompartment covered with crimson, like the grand staircase and doors, furnished\r\nwith stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged on each side of two regal chairs,\r\nplaced solemnly under a canopy.\r\n\n\r\nA signal was given, the doors rolled back, the assembly stood up, the orchestra\r\nburst out, and, to the welcome of a choral burst, enter the King, the Queen,\r\nthe Court of Labassecour.\r\n\n\r\nTill then, I had never set eyes on living king or queen; it may consequently be\r\nconjectured how I strained my powers of vision to take in these specimens of\r\nEuropean royalty. By whomsoever majesty is beheld for the first time, there\r\nwill always be experienced a vague surprise bordering on disappointment, that\r\nthe same does not appear seated, en permanence, on a throne, bonneted with a\r\ncrown, and furnished, as to the hand, with a sceptre. Looking out for a king\r\nand queen, and seeing only a middle-aged soldier and a rather young lady, I\r\nfelt half cheated, half pleased.\r\n\n\r\nWell do I recall that King\u2014a man of fifty, a little bowed, a little grey: there\r\nwas no face in all that assembly which resembled his. I had never read, never\r\nbeen told anything of his nature or his habits; and at first the strong\r\nhieroglyphics graven as with iron stylet on his brow, round his eyes, beside\r\nhis mouth, puzzled and baffled instinct. Ere long, however, if I did not know,\r\nat least I felt, the meaning of those characters written without hand. There\r\nsat a silent sufferer\u2014a nervous, melancholy man. Those eyes had looked on the\r\nvisits of a certain ghost\u2014had long waited the comings and goings of that\r\nstrangest spectre, Hypochondria. Perhaps he saw her now on that stage, over\r\nagainst him, amidst all that brilliant throng. Hypochondria has that wont, to\r\nrise in the midst of thousands\u2014dark as Doom, pale as Malady, and well-nigh\r\nstrong as Death. Her comrade and victim thinks to be happy one moment\u2014\u201cNot so,\u201d\r\nsays she; \u201cI come.\u201d And she freezes the blood in his heart, and beclouds the\r\nlight in his eye.\r\n\n\r\nSome might say it was the foreign crown pressing the King\u2019s brows which bent\r\nthem to that peculiar and painful fold; some might quote the effects of early\r\nbereavement. Something there might be of both these; but these are embittered\r\nby that darkest foe of humanity\u2014constitutional melancholy. The Queen, his wife,\r\nknew this: it seemed to me, the reflection of her husband\u2019s grief lay, a\r\nsubduing shadow, on her own benignant face. A mild, thoughtful, graceful woman\r\nthat princess seemed; not beautiful, not at all like the women of solid charms\r\nand marble feelings described a page or two since. Hers was a somewhat slender\r\nshape; her features, though distinguished enough, were too suggestive of\r\nreigning dynasties and royal lines to give unqualified pleasure. The expression\r\nclothing that profile was agreeable in the present instance; but you could not\r\navoid connecting it with remembered effigies, where similar lines appeared,\r\nunder phase ignoble; feeble, or sensual, or cunning, as the case might be. The\r\nQueen\u2019s eye, however, was her own; and pity, goodness, sweet sympathy, blessed\r\nit with divinest light. She moved no sovereign, but a lady\u2014kind, loving,\r\nelegant. Her little son, the Prince of Labassecour, and young Duc de\r\nDindonneau, accompanied her: he leaned on his mother\u2019s knee; and, ever and\r\nanon, in the course of that evening, I saw her observant of the monarch at her\r\nside, conscious of his beclouded abstraction, and desirous to rouse him from it\r\nby drawing his attention to their son. She often bent her head to listen to the\r\nboy\u2019s remarks, and would then smilingly repeat them to his sire. The moody King\r\nstarted, listened, smiled, but invariably relapsed as soon as his good angel\r\nceased speaking. Full mournful and significant was that spectacle! Not the less\r\nso because, both for the aristocracy and the honest bourgeoisie of Labassecour,\r\nits peculiarity seemed to be wholly invisible: I could not discover that one\r\nsoul present was either struck or touched.\r\n\n\r\nWith the King and Queen had entered their court, comprising two or three\r\nforeign ambassadors; and with them came the elite of the foreigners then\r\nresident in Villette. These took possession of the crimson benches; the ladies\r\nwere seated; most of the men remained standing: their sable rank, lining the\r\nbackground, looked like a dark foil to the splendour displayed in front. Nor\r\nwas this splendour without varying light and shade and gradation: the middle\r\ndistance was filled with matrons in velvets and satins, in plumes and gems; the\r\nbenches in the foreground, to the Queen\u2019s right hand, seemed devoted\r\nexclusively to young girls, the flower\u2014perhaps, I should rather say, the bud\u2014of\r\nVillette aristocracy. Here were no jewels, no head-dresses, no velvet pile or\r\nsilken sheen: purity, simplicity, and a\u00ebrial grace reigned in that virgin band.\r\nYoung heads simply braided, and fair forms (I was going to write sylph\r\nforms, but that would have been quite untrue: several of these \u201cjeunes filles,\u201d\r\nwho had not numbered more than sixteen or seventeen years, boasted contours as\r\nrobust and solid as those of a stout Englishwoman of five-and-twenty)\u2014fair\r\nforms robed in white, or pale rose, or placid blue, suggested thoughts of\r\nheaven and angels. I knew a couple, at least, of these \u201crose et blanche\u201d\r\nspecimens of humanity. Here was a pair of Madame Beck\u2019s late\r\npupils\u2014Mesdemoiselles Mathilde and Ang\u00e9lique: pupils who, during their last\r\nyear at school, ought to have been in the first class, but whose brains never\r\ngot them beyond the second division. In English, they had been under my own\r\ncharge, and hard work it was to get them to translate rationally a page of\r\nThe Vicar of Wakefield. Also during three months I had one of them for\r\nmy vis-\u00e0-vis at table, and the quantity of household bread, butter, and stewed\r\nfruit, she would habitually consume at \u201csecond d\u00e9jeuner\u201d was a real world\u2019s\r\nwonder\u2014to be exceeded only by the fact of her actually pocketing slices she\r\ncould not eat. Here be truths\u2014wholesome truths, too.\r\n\n\r\nI knew another of these seraphs\u2014the prettiest, or, at any rate, the least\r\ndemure and hypocritical looking of the lot: she was seated by the daughter of\r\nan English peer, also an honest, though haughty-looking girl: both had entered\r\nin the suite of the British embassy. She (i.e. my acquaintance) had a\r\nslight, pliant figure, not at all like the forms of the foreign damsels: her\r\nhair, too, was not close-braided, like a shell or a skull-cap of satin; it\r\nlooked like hair, and waved from her head, long, curled, and flowing.\r\nShe chatted away volubly, and seemed full of a light-headed sort of\r\nsatisfaction with herself and her position. I did not look at Dr. Bretton; but\r\nI knew that he, too, saw Ginevra Fanshawe: he had become so quiet, he answered\r\nso briefly his mother\u2019s remarks, he so often suppressed a sigh. Why should he\r\nsigh? He had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under difficulties; here\r\nwas full gratification for that taste. His lady-love beamed upon him from a\r\nsphere above his own: he could not come near her; he was not certain that he\r\ncould win from her a look. I watched to see if she would so far favour him. Our\r\nseat was not far from the crimson benches; we must inevitably be seen thence,\r\nby eyes so quick and roving as Miss Fanshawe\u2019s, and very soon those optics of\r\nhers were upon us: at least, upon Dr. and Mrs. Bretton. I kept rather in the\r\nshade and out of sight, not wishing to be immediately recognised: she looked\r\nquite steadily at Dr. John, and then she raised a glass to examine his mother;\r\na minute or two afterwards she laughingly whispered her neighbour; upon the\r\nperformance commencing, her rambling attention was attracted to the platform.\r\n\n\r\nOn the concert I need not dwell; the reader would not care to have my\r\nimpressions thereanent: and, indeed, it would not be worth while to record\r\nthem, as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse. The young ladies of\r\nthe Conservatoire, being very much frightened, made rather a tremulous\r\nexhibition on the two grand pianos. M. Josef Emanuel stood by them while they\r\nplayed; but he had not the tact or influence of his kinsman, who, under similar\r\ncircumstances, would certainly have compelled pupils of his to demean\r\nthemselves with heroism and self-possession. M. Paul would have placed the\r\nhysteric d\u00e9butantes between two fires\u2014terror of the audience, and terror of\r\nhimself\u2014and would have inspired them with the courage of desperation, by making\r\nthe latter terror incomparably the greater: M. Josef could not do this.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing the white muslin pianistes, came a fine, full-grown, sulky lady in\r\nwhite satin. She sang. Her singing just affected me like the tricks of a\r\nconjuror: I wondered how she did it\u2014how she made her voice run up and down, and\r\ncut such marvellous capers; but a simple Scotch melody, played by a rude street\r\nminstrel, has often moved me more deeply.\r\n\n\r\nAfterwards stepped forth a gentleman, who, bending his body a good deal in the\r\ndirection of the King and Queen, and frequently approaching his white-gloved\r\nhand to the region of his heart, vented a bitter outcry against a certain\r\n\u201cfausse Isabelle.\u201d I thought he seemed especially to solicit the Queen\u2019s\r\nsympathy; but, unless I am egregiously mistaken, her Majesty lent her attention\r\nrather with the calm of courtesy than the earnestness of interest. This\r\ngentleman\u2019s state of mind was very harrowing, and I was glad when he wound up\r\nhis musical exposition of the same.\r\n\n\r\nSome rousing choruses struck me as the best part of the evening\u2019s\r\nentertainment. There were present deputies from all the best provincial choral\r\nsocieties; genuine, barrel-shaped, native Labassecouriens. These worthies gave\r\nvoice without mincing the matter their hearty exertions had at least this good\r\nresult\u2014the ear drank thence a satisfying sense of power.\r\n\n\r\nThrough the whole performance\u2014timid instrumental duets, conceited vocal solos,\r\nsonorous, brass-lunged choruses\u2014my attention gave but one eye and one ear to\r\nthe stage, the other being permanently retained in the service of Dr. Bretton:\r\nI could not forget him, nor cease to question how he was feeling, what he was\r\nthinking, whether he was amused or the contrary. At last he spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you like it all, Lucy? You are very quiet,\u201d he said, in his own\r\ncheerful tone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am quiet,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I am so very, very much interested: not\r\nmerely with the music, but with everything about me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then proceeded to make some further remarks, with so much equanimity and\r\ncomposure that I began to think he had really not seen what I had seen, and I\r\nwhispered\u2014\u201cMiss Fanshawe is here: have you noticed her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! and I observed that you noticed her too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs she come with Mrs. Cholmondeley, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Cholmondeley is there with a very grand party. Yes; Ginevra was in\r\nher train; and Mrs. Cholmondeley was in Lady \u2014\u2014\u2019s train, who was in the\r\nQueen\u2019s train. If this were not one of the compact little minor European\r\ncourts, whose very formalities are little more imposing than familiarities, and\r\nwhose gala grandeur is but homeliness in Sunday array, it would sound all very\r\nfine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra saw you, I think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo do I think so. I have had my eye on her several times since you withdrew\r\nyours; and I have had the honour of witnessing a little spectacle which you\r\nwere spared.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not ask what; I waited voluntary information, which was presently given.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Fanshawe,\u201d he said, \u201chas a companion with her\u2014a lady of rank. I happen to\r\nknow Lady Sara by sight; her noble mother has called me in professionally. She\r\nis a proud girl, but not in the least insolent, and I doubt whether Ginevra\r\nwill have gained ground in her estimation by making a butt of her neighbours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat neighbours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerely myself and my mother. As to me it is all very natural: nothing, I\r\nsuppose, can be fairer game than the young bourgeois doctor; but my mother! I\r\nnever saw her ridiculed before. Do you know, the curling lip, and sarcastically\r\nlevelled glass thus directed, gave me a most curious sensation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Dr. John: it is not worth while. If Ginevra were in a\r\ngiddy mood, as she is eminently to-night, she would make no scruple of laughing\r\nat that mild, pensive Queen, or that melancholy King. She is not actuated by\r\nmalevolence, but sheer, heedless folly. To a feather-brained school-girl\r\nnothing is sacred.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you forget: I have not been accustomed to look on Miss Fanshawe in the\r\nlight of a feather-brained school-girl. Was she not my divinity\u2014the angel of my\r\ncareer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHem! There was your mistake.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo speak the honest truth, without any false rant or assumed romance, there\r\nactually was a moment, six months ago, when I thought her divine. Do you\r\nremember our conversation about the presents? I was not quite open with you in\r\ndiscussing that subject: the warmth with which you took it up amused me. By way\r\nof having the full benefit of your lights, I allowed you to think me more in\r\nthe dark than I really was. It was that test of the presents which first proved\r\nGinevra mortal. Still her beauty retained its fascination: three days\u2014three\r\nhours ago, I was very much her slave. As she passed me to-night, triumphant in\r\nbeauty, my emotions did her homage; but for one luckless sneer, I should yet be\r\nthe humblest of her servants. She might have scoffed at me, and, while\r\nwounding, she would not soon have alienated me: through myself, she could not\r\nin ten years have done what, in a moment, she has done through my mother.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held his peace awhile. Never before had I seen so much fire, and so little\r\nsunshine in Dr. John\u2019s blue eye as just now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d he recommenced, \u201clook well at my mother, and say, without fear or\r\nfavour, in what light she now appears to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs she always does\u2014an English, middle-class gentlewoman; well, though gravely\r\ndressed, habitually independent of pretence, constitutionally composed and\r\ncheerful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo she seems to me\u2014bless her! The merry may laugh with mamma, but the\r\nweak only will laugh at her. She shall not be ridiculed, with my\r\nconsent, at least; nor without my\u2014my scorn\u2014my antipathy\u2014my\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped: and it was time\u2014for he was getting excited\u2014more it seemed than the\r\noccasion warranted. I did not then know that he had witnessed double cause for\r\ndissatisfaction with Miss Fanshawe. The glow of his complexion, the expansion\r\nof his nostril, the bold curve which disdain gave his well-cut under lip,\r\nshowed him in a new and striking phase. Yet the rare passion of the\r\nconstitutionally suave and serene, is not a pleasant spectacle; nor did I like\r\nthe sort of vindictive thrill which passed through his strong young frame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo I frighten you, Lucy?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell why you are so very angry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor this reason,\u201d he muttered in my ear. \u201cGinevra is neither a pure angel, nor\r\na pure-minded woman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! you exaggerate: she has no great harm in her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cToo much for me. I can see where you are blind. Now dismiss the\r\nsubject. Let me amuse myself by teasing mamma: I will assert that she is\r\nflagging. Mamma, pray rouse yourself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJohn, I will certainly rouse you if you are not better conducted. Will you and\r\nLucy be silent, that I may hear the singing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey were then thundering in a chorus, under cover of which all the previous\r\ndialogue had taken place.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou hear the singing, mamma! Now, I will wager my studs, which are\r\ngenuine, against your paste brooch\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy paste brooch, Graham? Profane boy! you know that it is a stone of value.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! that is one of your superstitions: you were cheated in the business.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am cheated in fewer things than you imagine. How do you happen to be\r\nacquainted with young ladies of the court, John? I have observed two of them\r\npay you no small attention during the last half-hour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would not observe them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not? Because one of them satirically levels her eyeglass at me? She is a\r\npretty, silly girl: but are you apprehensive that her titter will discomfit the\r\nold lady?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sensible, admirable old lady! Mother, you are better to me than ten wives\r\nyet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be demonstrative, John, or I shall faint, and you will have to carry me\r\nout; and if that burden were laid upon you, you would reverse your last speech,\r\nand exclaim, \u2018Mother, ten wives could hardly be worse to me than you are!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe concert over, the Lottery \u201cau b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pauvres\u201d came next: the interval\r\nbetween was one of general relaxation, and the pleasantest imaginable stir and\r\ncommotion. The white flock was cleared from the platform; a busy throng of\r\ngentlemen crowded it instead, making arrangements for the drawing; and amongst\r\nthese\u2014the busiest of all\u2014re-appeared that certain well-known form, not tall but\r\nactive, alive with the energy and movement of three tall men. How M. Paul did\r\nwork! How he issued directions, and, at the same time, set his own shoulder to\r\nthe wheel! Half-a-dozen assistants were at his beck to remove the pianos,\r\n&c.; no matter, he must add to their strength his own. The redundancy of\r\nhis alertness was half-vexing, half-ludicrous: in my mind I both disapproved\r\nand derided most of this fuss. Yet, in the midst of prejudice and annoyance, I\r\ncould not, while watching, avoid perceiving a certain not disagreeable na\u00efvet\u00e9\r\nin all he did and said; nor could I be blind to certain vigorous\r\ncharacteristics of his physiognomy, rendered conspicuous now by the contrast\r\nwith a throng of tamer faces: the deep, intent keenness of his eye, the power\r\nof his forehead, pale, broad, and full\u2014the mobility of his most flexible mouth.\r\nHe lacked the calm of force, but its movement and its fire he signally\r\npossessed.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime the whole hall was in a stir; most people rose and remained standing,\r\nfor a change; some walked about, all talked and laughed. The crimson\r\ncompartment presented a peculiarly animated scene. The long cloud of gentlemen,\r\nbreaking into fragments, mixed with the rainbow line of ladies; two or three\r\nofficer-like men approached the King and conversed with him. The Queen, leaving\r\nher chair, glided along the rank of young ladies, who all stood up as she\r\npassed; and to each in turn I saw her vouchsafe some token of kindness\u2014a\r\ngracious word, look or smile. To the two pretty English girls, Lady Sara and\r\nGinevra Fanshawe, she addressed several sentences; as she left them, both, and\r\nespecially the latter, seemed to glow all over with gratification. They were\r\nafterwards accosted by several ladies, and a little circle of gentlemen\r\ngathered round them; amongst these\u2014the nearest to Ginevra\u2014stood the Count de\r\nHamal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis room is stiflingly hot,\u201d said Dr. Bretton, rising with sudden impatience.\r\n\u201cLucy\u2014mother\u2014will you come a moment to the fresh air?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo with him, Lucy,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton. \u201cI would rather keep my seat.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWillingly would I have kept mine also, but Graham\u2019s desire must take precedence\r\nof my own; I accompanied him.\r\n\n\r\nWe found the night-air keen; or at least I did: he did not seem to feel it; but\r\nit was very still, and the star-sown sky spread cloudless. I was wrapped in a\r\nfur shawl. We took some turns on the pavement; in passing under a lamp, Graham\r\nencountered my eye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look pensive, Lucy: is it on my account?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was only fearing that you were grieved.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all: so be of good cheer\u2014as I am. Whenever I die, Lucy, my persuasion\r\nis that it will not be of heart-complaint. I may be stung, I may seem to droop\r\nfor a time, but no pain or malady of sentiment has yet gone through my whole\r\nsystem. You have always seen me cheerful at home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGenerally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad she laughed at my mother. I would not give the old lady for a dozen\r\nbeauties. That sneer did me all the good in the world. Thank you, Miss\r\nFanshawe!\u201d And he lifted his hat from his waved locks, and made a mock\r\nreverence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI thank her. She has made me feel that nine parts in ten of my\r\nheart have always been sound as a bell, and the tenth bled from a mere\r\npuncture: a lancet-prick that will heal in a trice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are angry just now, heated and indignant; you will think and feel\r\ndifferently to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI heated and indignant! You don\u2019t know me. On the contrary, the heat is\r\ngone: I am as cool as the night\u2014which, by the way, may be too cool for you. We\r\nwill go back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. John, this is a sudden change.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot it: or if it be, there are good reasons for it\u2014two good reasons: I have\r\ntold you one. But now let us re-enter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe did not easily regain our seats; the lottery was begun, and all was excited\r\nconfusion; crowds blocked the sort of corridor along which we had to pass: it\r\nwas necessary to pause for a time. Happening to glance round\u2014indeed I half\r\nfancied I heard my name pronounced\u2014I saw quite near, the ubiquitous, the\r\ninevitable M. Paul. He was looking at me gravely and intently: at me, or rather\r\nat my pink dress\u2014sardonic comment on which gleamed in his eye. Now it was his\r\nhabit to indulge in strictures on the dress, both of the teachers and pupils,\r\nat Madame Beck\u2019s\u2014a habit which the former, at least, held to be an offensive\r\nimpertinence: as yet I had not suffered from it\u2014my sombre daily attire not\r\nbeing calculated to attract notice. I was in no mood to permit any new\r\nencroachment to-night: rather than accept his banter, I would ignore his\r\npresence, and accordingly steadily turned my face to the sleeve of Dr. John\u2019s\r\ncoat; finding in that same black sleeve a prospect more redolent of pleasure\r\nand comfort, more genial, more friendly, I thought, than was offered by the\r\ndark little Professor\u2019s unlovely visage. Dr. John seemed unconsciously to\r\nsanction the preference by looking down and saying in his kind voice, \u201cAy, keep\r\nclose to my side, Lucy: these crowding burghers are no respecters of persons.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not, however, be true to myself. Yielding to some influence, mesmeric\r\nor otherwise\u2014an influence unwelcome, displeasing, but effective\u2014I again glanced\r\nround to see if M. Paul was gone. No, there he stood on the same spot, looking\r\nstill, but with a changed eye; he had penetrated my thought, and read my wish\r\nto shun him. The mocking but not ill-humoured gaze was turned to a swarthy\r\nfrown, and when I bowed, with a view to conciliation, I got only the stiffest\r\nand sternest of nods in return.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhom have you made angry, Lucy?\u201d whispered Dr. Bretton, smiling. \u201cWho is that\r\nsavage-looking friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne of the professors at Madame Beck\u2019s: a very cross little man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe looks mighty cross just now: what have you done to him? What is it all\r\nabout? Ah, Lucy, Lucy! tell me the meaning of this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo mystery, I assure you. M. Emanuel is very exigeant, and because I looked at\r\nyour coat-sleeve, instead of curtseying and dipping to him, he thinks I have\r\nfailed in respect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe little\u2014\u201d began Dr. John: I know not what more he would have added, for at\r\nthat moment I was nearly thrown down amongst the feet of the crowd. M. Paul had\r\nrudely pushed past, and was elbowing his way with such utter disregard to the\r\nconvenience and security of all around, that a very uncomfortable pressure was\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think he is what he himself would call \u2018m\u00e9chant,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Bretton. I\r\nthought so, too.\r\n\n\r\nSlowly and with difficulty we made our way along the passage, and at last\r\nregained our seats. The drawing of the lottery lasted nearly an hour; it was an\r\nanimating and amusing scene; and as we each held tickets, we shared in the\r\nalternations of hope and fear raised by each turn of the wheel. Two little\r\ngirls, of five and six years old, drew the numbers: and the prizes were duly\r\nproclaimed from the platform. These prizes were numerous, though of small\r\nvalue. It so fell out that Dr. John and I each gained one: mine was a\r\ncigar-case, his a lady\u2019s head-dress\u2014a most airy sort of blue and silver turban,\r\nwith a streamer of plumage on one side, like a snowy cloud. He was excessively\r\nanxious to make an exchange; but I could not be brought to hear reason, and to\r\nthis day I keep my cigar-case: it serves, when I look at it, to remind me of\r\nold times, and one happy evening.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John, for his part, held his turban at arm\u2019s length between his finger and\r\nthumb, and looked at it with a mixture of reverence and embarrassment highly\r\nprovocative of laughter. The contemplation over, he was about coolly to deposit\r\nthe delicate fabric on the ground between his feet; he seemed to have no shadow\r\nof an idea of the treatment or stowage it ought to receive: if his mother had\r\nnot come to the rescue, I think he would finally have crushed it under his arm\r\nlike an opera-hat; she restored it to the band-box whence it had issued.\r\n\n\r\nGraham was quite cheerful all the evening, and his cheerfulness seemed natural\r\nand unforced. His demeanour, his look, is not easily described; there was\r\nsomething in it peculiar, and, in its way, original. I read in it no common\r\nmastery of the passions, and a fund of deep and healthy strength which, without\r\nany exhausting effort, bore down Disappointment and extracted her fang. His\r\nmanner, now, reminded me of qualities I had noticed in him when professionally\r\nengaged amongst the poor, the guilty, and the suffering, in the Basse-Ville: he\r\nlooked at once determined, enduring, and sweet-tempered. Who could help liking\r\nhim? He betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with\r\nconsiderations as to how its faltering must be propped; from him broke\r\nno irritability which startled calm and quenched mirth; his lips let\r\nfall no caustic that burned to the bone; his eye shot no morose shafts\r\nthat went cold, and rusty, and venomed through your heart: beside him was rest\r\nand refuge\u2014around him, fostering sunshine.\r\n\n\r\nAnd yet he had neither forgiven nor forgotten Miss Fanshawe. Once angered, I\r\ndoubt if Dr. Bretton were to be soon propitiated\u2014once alienated, whether he\r\nwere ever to be reclaimed. He looked at her more than once; not stealthily or\r\nhumbly, but with a movement of hardy, open observation. De Hamal was now a\r\nfixture beside her; Mrs. Cholmondeley sat near, and they and she were wholly\r\nabsorbed in the discourse, mirth, and excitement, with which the crimson seats\r\nwere as much astir as any plebeian part of the hall. In the course of some\r\napparently animated discussion, Ginevra once or twice lifted her hand and arm;\r\na handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter. I saw that its gleam flickered in\r\nDr. John\u2019s eye\u2014quickening therein a derisive, ireful sparkle; he laughed:\u2014\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cI will lay my turban on my wonted altar of offerings;\r\nthere, at any rate, it would be certain to find favour: no grisette has a more\r\nfacile faculty of acceptance. Strange! for after all, I know she is a girl of\r\nfamily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know her education, Dr. John,\u201d said I. \u201cTossed about all her\r\nlife from one foreign school to another, she may justly proffer the plea of\r\nignorance in extenuation of most of her faults. And then, from what she says, I\r\nbelieve her father and mother were brought up much as she has been brought up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI always understood she had no fortune; and once I had pleasure in the\r\nthought,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe tells me,\u201d I answered, \u201cthat they are poor at home; she always speaks\r\nquite candidly on such points: you never find her lying, as these foreigners\r\nwill often lie. Her parents have a large family: they occupy such a station and\r\npossess such connections as, in their opinion, demand display; stringent\r\nnecessity of circumstances and inherent thoughtlessness of disposition\r\ncombined, have engendered reckless unscrupulousness as to how they obtain the\r\nmeans of sustaining a good appearance. This is the state of things, and the\r\nonly state of things, she has seen from childhood upwards.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe it\u2014and I thought to mould her to something better: but, Lucy, to\r\nspeak the plain truth, I have felt a new thing to-night, in looking at her and\r\nde Hamal. I felt it before noticing the impertinence directed at my mother. I\r\nsaw a look interchanged between them immediately after their entrance, which\r\nthrew a most unwelcome light on my mind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow do you mean? You have been long aware of the flirtation they keep up?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, flirtation! That might be an innocent girlish wile to lure on the true\r\nlover; but what I refer to was not flirtation: it was a look marking mutual and\r\nsecret understanding\u2014it was neither girlish nor innocent. No woman, were she as\r\nbeautiful as Aphrodite, who could give or receive such a glance, shall ever be\r\nsought in marriage by me: I would rather wed a paysanne in a short petticoat\r\nand high cap\u2014and be sure that she was honest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help smiling. I felt sure he now exaggerated the case: Ginevra, I\r\nwas certain, was honest enough, with all her giddiness. I told him so. He shook\r\nhis head, and said he would not be the man to trust her with his honour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe only thing,\u201d said I, \u201cwith which you may safely trust her. She would\r\nunscrupulously damage a husband\u2019s purse and property, recklessly try his\r\npatience and temper: I don\u2019t think she would breathe, or let another breathe,\r\non his honour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are becoming her advocate,\u201d said he. \u201cDo you wish me to resume my old\r\nchains?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I am glad to see you free, and trust that free you will long remain. Yet\r\nbe, at the same time, just.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so: just as Rhadamanthus, Lucy. When once I am thoroughly estranged, I\r\ncannot help being severe. But look! the King and Queen are rising. I like that\r\nQueen: she has a sweet countenance. Mamma, too, is excessively tired; we shall\r\nnever get the old lady home if we stay longer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tired, John?\u201d cried Mrs. Bretton, looking at least as animated and as\r\nwide-awake as her son. \u201cI would undertake to sit you out yet: leave us both\r\nhere till morning, and we should see which would look the most jaded by\r\nsunrise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should not like to try the experiment; for, in truth, mamma, you are the\r\nmost unfading of evergreens and the freshest of matrons. It must then be on the\r\nplea of your son\u2019s delicate nerves and fragile constitution that I found a\r\npetition for our speedy adjournment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndolent young man! You wish you were in bed, no doubt; and I suppose you must\r\nbe humoured. There is Lucy, too, looking quite done up. For shame, Lucy! At\r\nyour age, a week of evenings-out would not have made me a shade paler. Come\r\naway, both of you; and you may laugh at the old lady as much as you please,\r\nbut, for my part, I shall take charge of the bandbox and turban.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich she did accordingly. I offered to relieve her, but was shaken off with\r\nkindly contempt: my godmother opined that I had enough to do to take care of\r\nmyself. Not standing on ceremony now, in the midst of the gay \u201cconfusion worse\r\nconfounded\u201d succeeding to the King and Queen\u2019s departure, Mrs. Bretton preceded\r\nus, and promptly made us a lane through the crowd. Graham followed,\r\napostrophizing his mother as the most flourishing grisette it had ever been his\r\ngood fortune to see charged with carriage of a bandbox; he also desired me to\r\nmark her affection for the sky-blue turban, and announced his conviction that\r\nshe intended one day to wear it.\r\n\n\r\nThe night was now very cold and very dark, but with little delay we found the\r\ncarriage. Soon we were packed in it, as warm and as snug as at a fire-side; and\r\nthe drive home was, I think, still pleasanter than the drive to the concert.\r\nPleasant it was, even though the coachman\u2014having spent in the shop of a\r\n\u201cmarchand de vin\u201d a portion of the time we passed at the concert\u2014drove us along\r\nthe dark and solitary chauss\u00e9e far past the turn leading down to La Terrasse;\r\nwe, who were occupied in talking and laughing, not noticing the aberration\r\ntill, at last, Mrs. Bretton intimated that, though she had always thought the\r\nch\u00e2teau a retired spot, she did not know it was situated at the world\u2019s end, as\r\nshe declared seemed now to be the case, for she believed we had been an hour\r\nand a half en route, and had not yet taken the turn down the avenue.\r\n\n\r\nThen Graham looked out, and perceiving only dim-spread fields, with unfamiliar\r\nrows of pollards and limes ranged along their else invisible sunk-fences, began\r\nto conjecture how matters were, and calling a halt and descending, he mounted\r\nthe box and took the reins himself. Thanks to him, we arrived safe at home\r\nabout an hour and a half beyond our time.\r\n\n\r\nMartha had not forgotten us; a cheerful fire was burning, and a neat supper\r\nspread in the dining-room: we were glad of both. The winter dawn was actually\r\nbreaking before we gained our chambers. I took off my pink dress and lace\r\nmantle with happier feelings than I had experienced in putting them on. Not\r\nall, perhaps, who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say the\r\nsame; for not all had been satisfied with friendship\u2014with its calm comfort and\r\nmodest hope.\r\n\n"}
{"22": "\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nREACTION.\n\r\nYet three days, and then I must go back to the pensionnat. I almost\r\nnumbered the moments of these days upon the clock; fain would I have retarded\r\ntheir flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they were already gone\r\nwhile I yet feared their departure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy will not leave us to-day,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton, coaxingly at breakfast;\r\n\u201cshe knows we can procure a second respite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would not ask for one if I might have it for a word,\u201d said I. \u201cI long to get\r\nthe good-by over, and to be settled in the Rue Fossette again. I must go this\r\nmorning: I must go directly; my trunk is packed and corded.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt appeared; however, that my going depended upon Graham; he had said he would\r\naccompany me, and it so fell out that he was engaged all day, and only\r\nreturned home at dusk. Then ensued a little combat of words. Mrs. Bretton and\r\nher son pressed me to remain one night more. I could have cried, so irritated\r\nand eager was I to be gone. I longed to leave them as the criminal on the\r\nscaffold longs for the axe to descend: that is, I wished the pang over. How\r\nmuch I wished it, they could not tell. On these points, mine was a state of\r\nmind out of their experience.\r\n\n\r\nIt was dark when Dr. John handed me from the carriage at Madame Beck\u2019s door.\r\nThe lamp above was lit; it rained a November drizzle, as it had rained all day:\r\nthe lamplight gleamed on the wet pavement. Just such a night was it as that on\r\nwhich, not a year ago, I had first stopped at this very threshold; just similar\r\nwas the scene. I remembered the very shapes of the paving-stones which I had\r\nnoted with idle eye, while, with a thick-beating heart, I waited the unclosing\r\nof that door at which I stood\u2014a solitary and a suppliant. On that night, too, I\r\nhad briefly met him who now stood with me. Had I ever reminded him of that\r\nrencontre, or explained it? I had not, nor ever felt the inclination to do so:\r\nit was a pleasant thought, laid by in my own mind, and best kept there.\r\n\n\r\nGraham rung the bell. The door was instantly opened, for it was just that\r\nperiod of the evening when the half-boarders took their departure\u2014consequently,\r\nRosine was on the alert.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in,\u201d said I to him; but he stepped a moment into the well-lighted\r\nvestibule. I had not wished him to see that \u201cthe water stood in my eyes,\u201d for\r\nhis was too kind a nature ever to be needlessly shown such signs of sorrow. He\r\nalways wished to heal\u2014to relieve\u2014when, physician as he was, neither cure nor\r\nalleviation were, perhaps, in his power.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep up your courage, Lucy. Think of my mother and myself as true friends. We\r\nwill not forget you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor will I forget you, Dr. John.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy trunk was now brought in. We had shaken hands; he had turned to go, but he\r\nwas not satisfied: he had not done or said enough to content his generous\r\nimpulses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d\u2014stepping after me\u2014\u201cshall you feel very solitary here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt first I shall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, my mother will soon call to see you; and, meantime, I\u2019ll tell you what\r\nI\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll write\u2014just any cheerful nonsense that comes into my head\u2014shall\r\nI?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood, gallant heart!\u201d thought I to myself; but I shook my head, smiling, and\r\nsaid, \u201cNever think of it: impose on yourself no such task. You write to\r\nme!\u2014you\u2019ll not have time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! I will find or make time. Good-by!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was gone. The heavy door crashed to: the axe had fallen\u2014the pang was\r\nexperienced.\r\n\n\r\nAllowing myself no time to think or feel\u2014swallowing tears as if they had been\r\nwine\u2014I passed to Madame\u2019s sitting-room to pay the necessary visit of ceremony\r\nand respect. She received me with perfectly well-acted cordiality\u2014was even\r\ndemonstrative, though brief, in her welcome. In ten minutes I was dismissed.\r\nFrom the salle-\u00e0-manger I proceeded to the refectory, where pupils and teachers\r\nwere now assembled for evening study: again I had a welcome, and one not, I\r\nthink, quite hollow. That over, I was free to repair to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd will Graham really write?\u201d I questioned, as I sank tired on the edge of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\n\r\nReason, coming stealthily up to me through the twilight of that long, dim\r\nchamber, whispered sedately\u2014\u201cHe may write once. So kind is his nature, it may\r\nstimulate him for once to make the effort. But it cannot be continued\u2014it\r\nmay not be repeated. Great were that folly which should build on such a\r\npromise\u2014insane that credulity which should mistake the transitory rain-pool,\r\nholding in its hollow one draught, for the perennial spring yielding the supply\r\nof seasons.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI bent my head: I sat thinking an hour longer. Reason still whispered me,\r\nlaying on my shoulder a withered hand, and frostily touching my ear with the\r\nchill blue lips of eld.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf,\u201d muttered she, \u201cif he should write, what then? Do you meditate\r\npleasure in replying? Ah, fool! I warn you! Brief be your answer. Hope no\r\ndelight of heart\u2014no indulgence of intellect: grant no expansion to feeling\u2014give\r\nholiday to no single faculty: dally with no friendly exchange: foster no genial\r\nintercommunion\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I have talked to Graham and you did not chide,\u201d I pleaded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said she, \u201cI needed not. Talk for you is good discipline. You converse\r\nimperfectly. While you speak, there can be no oblivion of inferiority\u2014no\r\nencouragement to delusion: pain, privation, penury stamp your language\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I again broke in, \u201cwhere the bodily presence is weak and the speech\r\ncontemptible, surely there cannot be error in making written language the\r\nmedium of better utterance than faltering lips can achieve?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReason only answered, \u201cAt your peril you cherish that idea, or suffer its\r\ninfluence to animate any writing of yours!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if I feel, may I never express?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d declared Reason.\r\n\n\r\nI groaned under her bitter sternness. Never\u2014never\u2014oh, hard word! This hag, this\r\nReason, would not let me look up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless\r\nI were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her,\r\nI was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and\r\nsteadily through all life to despond. Reason might be right; yet no wonder we\r\nare glad at times to defy her, to rush from under her rod and give a truant\r\nhour to Imagination\u2014her soft, bright foe, our sweet Help, our\r\ndivine Hope. We shall and must break bounds at intervals, despite the terrible\r\nrevenge that awaits our return. Reason is vindictive as a devil: for me she was\r\nalways envenomed as a step-mother. If I have obeyed her it has chiefly been\r\nwith the obedience of fear, not of love. Long ago I should have died of her\r\nill-usage her stint, her chill, her barren board, her icy bed, her savage,\r\nceaseless blows; but for that kinder Power who holds my secret and sworn\r\nallegiance. Often has Reason turned me out by night, in mid-winter, on cold\r\nsnow, flinging for sustenance the gnawed bone dogs had forsaken: sternly has\r\nshe vowed her stores held nothing more for me\u2014harshly denied my right to ask\r\nbetter things\u2026. Then, looking up, have I seen in the sky a head amidst circling\r\nstars, of which the midmost and the brightest lent a ray sympathetic and\r\nattent. A spirit, softer and better than Human Reason, has descended with quiet\r\nflight to the waste\u2014bringing all round her a sphere of air borrowed of eternal\r\nsummer; bringing perfume of flowers which cannot fade\u2014fragrance of trees whose\r\nfruit is life; bringing breezes pure from a world whose day needs no sun to\r\nlighten it. My hunger has this good angel appeased with food, sweet and\r\nstrange, gathered amongst gleaning angels, garnering their dew-white harvest in\r\nthe first fresh hour of a heavenly day; tenderly has she assuaged the\r\ninsufferable fears which weep away life itself\u2014kindly given rest to deadly\r\nweariness\u2014generously lent hope and impulse to paralyzed despair. Divine,\r\ncompassionate, succourable influence! When I bend the knee to other than God,\r\nit shall be at thy white and winged feet, beautiful on mountain or on plain.\r\nTemples have been reared to the Sun\u2014altars dedicated to the Moon. Oh, greater\r\nglory! To thee neither hands build, nor lips consecrate: but hearts, through\r\nages, are faithful to thy worship. A dwelling thou hast, too wide for walls,\r\ntoo high for dome\u2014a temple whose floors are space\u2014rites whose mysteries\r\ntranspire in presence, to the kindling, the harmony of worlds!\r\n\n\r\nSovereign complete! thou hadst, for endurance, thy great army of martyrs; for\r\nachievement, thy chosen band of worthies. Deity unquestioned, thine essence\r\nfoils decay!\r\n\n\r\nThis daughter of Heaven remembered me to-night; she saw me weep, and she came\r\nwith comfort: \u201cSleep,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep, sweetly\u2014I gild thy dreams!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe kept her word, and watched me through a night\u2019s rest; but at dawn Reason\r\nrelieved the guard. I awoke with a sort of start; the rain was dashing against\r\nthe panes, and the wind uttering a peevish cry at intervals; the night-lamp was\r\ndying on the black circular stand in the middle of the dormitory: day had\r\nalready broken. How I pity those whom mental pain stuns instead of rousing!\r\nThis morning the pang of waking snatched me out of bed like a hand with a\r\ngiant\u2019s gripe. How quickly I dressed in the cold of the raw dawn! How deeply I\r\ndrank of the ice-cold water in my carafe! This was always my cordial, to which,\r\nlike other dram-drinkers, I had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin.\r\n\n\r\nEre long the bell rang its r\u00e9veill\u00e9e to the whole school. Being dressed,\r\nI descended alone to the refectory, where the stove was lit and the air was\r\nwarm; through the rest of the house it was cold, with the nipping severity of a\r\ncontinental winter: though now but the beginning of November, a north wind had\r\nthus early brought a wintry blight over Europe: I remember the black stoves\r\npleased me little when I first came; but now I began to associate with them a\r\nsense of comfort, and liked them, as in England we like a fireside.\r\n\n\r\nSitting down before this dark comforter, I presently fell into a deep argument\r\nwith myself on life and its chances, on destiny and her decrees. My mind,\r\ncalmer and stronger now than last night, made for itself some imperious rules,\r\nprohibiting under deadly penalties all weak retrospect of happiness past;\r\ncommanding a patient journeying through the wilderness of the present,\r\nenjoining a reliance on faith\u2014a watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue\r\nwhile they guide, and awe while they illumine\u2014hushing the impulse to fond\r\nidolatry, checking the longing out-look for a far-off promised land whose\r\nrivers are, perhaps, never to be reached save in dying dreams, whose sweet\r\npastures are to be viewed but from the desolate and sepulchral summit of a\r\nNebo.\r\n\n\r\nBy degrees, a composite feeling of blended strength and pain wound itself\r\nwirily round my heart, sustained, or at least restrained, its throbbings, and\r\nmade me fit for the day\u2019s work. I lifted my head.\r\n\n\r\nAs I said before, I was sitting near the stove, let into the wall beneath the\r\nrefectory and the carr\u00e9, and thus sufficing to heat both apartments. Piercing\r\nthe same wall, and close beside the stove, was a window, looking also into the\r\ncarr\u00e9; as I looked up a cap-tassel, a brow, two eyes, filled a pane of that\r\nwindow; the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit right against my own glance: they\r\nwere watching me. I had not till that moment known that tears were on my cheek,\r\nbut I felt them now.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a strange house, where no corner was sacred from intrusion, where not\r\na tear could be shed, nor a thought pondered, but a spy was at hand to note and\r\nto divine. And this new, this out-door, this male spy, what business had\r\nbrought him to the premises at this unwonted hour? What possible right had he\r\nto intrude on me thus? No other professor would have dared to cross the carr\u00e9\r\nbefore the class-bell rang. M. Emanuel took no account of hours nor of claims:\r\nthere was some book of reference in the first-class library which he had\r\noccasion to consult; he had come to seek it: on his way he passed the\r\nrefectory. It was very much his habit to wear eyes before, behind, and on each\r\nside of him: he had seen me through the little window\u2014he now opened the\r\nrefectory door, and there he stood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, vous \u00eates triste.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, j\u2019en ai bien le droit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous \u00eates malade de c\u0153ur et d\u2019humeur,\u201d he pursued. \u201cYou are at once mournful\r\nand mutinous. I see on your cheek two tears which I know are hot as two sparks,\r\nand salt as two crystals of the sea. While I speak you eye me strangely. Shall\r\nI tell you of what I am reminded while watching you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I shall be called away to prayers shortly; my time for conversation\r\nis very scant and brief at this hour\u2014excuse\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI excuse everything,\u201d he interrupted; \u201cmy mood is so meek, neither rebuff nor,\r\nperhaps, insult could ruffle it. You remind me, then, of a young she wild\r\ncreature, new caught, untamed, viewing with a mixture of fire and fear the\r\nfirst entrance of the breaker-in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUnwarrantable accost!\u2014rash and rude if addressed to a pupil; to a teacher\r\ninadmissible. He thought to provoke a warm reply; I had seen him vex the\r\npassionate to explosion before now. In me his malice should find no\r\ngratification; I sat silent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou look,\u201d said he, \u201clike one who would snatch at a draught of sweet poison,\r\nand spurn wholesome bitters with disgust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I never liked bitters; nor do I believe them wholesome. And to\r\nwhatever is sweet, be it poison or food, you cannot, at least, deny its own\r\ndelicious quality\u2014sweetness. Better, perhaps, to die quickly a pleasant death,\r\nthan drag on long a charmless life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d said he, \u201cyou should take your bitter dose duly and daily, if I had the\r\npower to administer it; and, as to the well-beloved poison, I would, perhaps,\r\nbreak the very cup which held it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sharply turned my head away, partly because his presence utterly displeased\r\nme, and partly because I wished to shun questions: lest, in my present mood,\r\nthe effort of answering should overmaster self-command.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said he, more softly, \u201ctell me the truth\u2014you grieve at being parted\r\nfrom friends\u2014is it not so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe insinuating softness was not more acceptable than the inquisitorial\r\ncuriosity. I was silent. He came into the room, sat down on the bench about two\r\nyards from me, and persevered long, and, for him, patiently, in attempts to\r\ndraw me into conversation\u2014attempts necessarily unavailing, because I\r\ncould not talk. At last I entreated to be let alone. In uttering the\r\nrequest, my voice faltered, my head sank on my arms and the table. I wept\r\nbitterly, though quietly. He sat a while longer. I did not look up nor speak,\r\ntill the closing door and his retreating step told me that he was gone. These\r\ntears proved a relief.\r\n\n\r\nI had time to bathe my eyes before breakfast, and I suppose I appeared at that\r\nmeal as serene as any other person: not, however, quite as jocund-looking as\r\nthe young lady who placed herself in the seat opposite mine, fixed on me a pair\r\nof somewhat small eyes twinkling gleefully, and frankly stretched across the\r\ntable a white hand to be shaken. Miss Fanshawe\u2019s travels, gaieties, and\r\nflirtations agreed with her mightily; she had become quite plump, her cheeks\r\nlooked as round as apples. I had seen her last in elegant evening attire. I\r\ndon\u2019t know that she looked less charming now in her school-dress, a kind of\r\ncareless peignoir of a dark-blue material, dimly and dingily plaided with\r\nblack. I even think this dusky wrapper gave her charms a triumph; enhancing by\r\ncontrast the fairness of her skin, the freshness of her bloom, the golden\r\nbeauty of her tresses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you are come back, Timon,\u201d said she. Timon was one of her dozen\r\nnames for me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how often I have wanted you in this dismal hole.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, have you? Then, of course, if you wanted me, you have something for me to\r\ndo: stockings to mend, perhaps.\u201d I never gave Ginevra a minute\u2019s or a\r\nfarthing\u2019s credit for disinterestedness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCrabbed and crusty as ever!\u201d said she. \u201cI expected as much: it would not be\r\nyou if you did not snub one. But now, come, grand-mother, I hope you like\r\ncoffee as much, and pistolets as little as ever: are you disposed to barter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake your own way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis way consisted in a habit she had of making me convenient. She did not like\r\nthe morning cup of coffee; its school brewage not being strong or sweet enough\r\nto suit her palate; and she had an excellent appetite, like any other healthy\r\nschool-girl, for the morning pistolets or rolls, which were new-baked and very\r\ngood, and of which a certain allowance was served to each. This allowance being\r\nmore than I needed, I gave half to Ginevra; never varying in my preference,\r\nthough many others used to covet the superfluity; and she in return would\r\nsometimes give me a portion of her coffee. This morning I was glad of the\r\ndraught; hunger I had none, and with thirst I was parched. I don\u2019t know why I\r\nchose to give my bread rather to Ginevra than to another; nor why, if two had\r\nto share the convenience of one drinking-vessel, as sometimes happened\u2014for\r\ninstance, when we took a long walk into the country, and halted for refreshment\r\nat a farm\u2014I always contrived that she should be my convive, and rather liked to\r\nlet her take the lion\u2019s share, whether of the white beer, the sweet wine, or\r\nthe new milk: so it was, however, and she knew it; and, therefore, while we\r\nwrangled daily, we were never alienated.\r\n\n\r\nAfter breakfast my custom was to withdraw to the first classe, and sit and\r\nread, or think (oftenest the latter) there alone, till the nine-o\u2019clock bell\r\nthrew open all doors, admitted the gathered rush of externes and\r\ndemi-pensionnaires, and gave the signal for entrance on that bustle and\r\nbusiness to which, till five P.M., there was no relax.\r\n\n\r\nI was just seated this morning, when a tap came to the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon, Mademoiselle,\u201d said a pensionnaire, entering gently; and having taken\r\nfrom her desk some necessary book or paper, she withdrew on tip-toe, murmuring\r\nas she passed me, \u201cQue mademoiselle est appliqu\u00e9e!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAppliqu\u00e9e, indeed! The means of application were spread before me, but I was\r\ndoing nothing; and had done nothing, and meant to do nothing. Thus does the\r\nworld give us credit for merits we have not. Madame Beck herself deemed me a\r\nregular bas-bleu, and often and solemnly used to warn me not to study too much,\r\nlest \u201cthe blood should all go to my head.\u201d Indeed, everybody in the Rue\r\nFossette held a superstition that \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d was learned; with the notable\r\nexception of M. Emanuel, who, by means peculiar to himself, and quite\r\ninscrutable to me, had obtained a not inaccurate inkling of my real\r\nqualifications, and used to take quiet opportunities of chuckling in my ear his\r\nmalign glee over their scant measure. For my part, I never troubled myself\r\nabout this penury. I dearly like to think my own thoughts; I had great pleasure\r\nin reading a few books, but not many: preferring always those on whose style or\r\nsentiment the writer\u2019s individual nature was plainly stamped; flagging\r\ninevitably over characterless books, however clever and meritorious: perceiving\r\nwell that, as far as my own mind was concerned, God had limited its powers and,\r\nits action\u2014thankful, I trust, for the gift bestowed, but unambitious of higher\r\nendowments, not restlessly eager after higher culture.\r\n\n\r\nThe polite pupil was scarcely gone, when, unceremoniously, without tap, in\r\nburst a second intruder. Had I been blind I should have known who this was. A\r\nconstitutional reserve of manner had by this time told with wholesome and, for\r\nme, commodious effect, on the manners of my co-inmates; rarely did I now suffer\r\nfrom rude or intrusive treatment. When I first came, it would happen once and\r\nagain that a blunt German would clap me on the shoulder, and ask me to run a\r\nrace; or a riotous Labassecourienne seize me by the arm and drag me towards the\r\nplayground: urgent proposals to take a swing at the \u201cPas de G\u00e9ant,\u201d or to join\r\nin a certain romping hide-and-seek game called \u201cUn, deux, trois,\u201d were formerly\r\nalso of hourly occurrence; but all these little attentions had ceased some time\r\nago\u2014ceased, too, without my finding it necessary to be at the trouble of\r\npoint-blank cutting them short. I had now no familiar demonstration to dread or\r\nendure, save from one quarter; and as that was English I could bear it. Ginevra\r\nFanshawe made no scruple of\u2014at times\u2014catching me as I was crossing the carr\u00e9,\r\nwhirling me round in a compulsory waltz, and heartily enjoying the mental and\r\nphysical discomfiture her proceeding induced. Ginevra Fanshawe it was who now\r\nbroke in upon \u201cmy learned leisure.\u201d She carried a huge music-book under her\r\narm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo to your practising,\u201d said I to her at once: \u201caway with you to the little\r\nsalon!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot till I have had a talk with you, ch\u00e8re amie. I know where you have been\r\nspending your vacation, and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces,\r\nand enjoying life like any other belle. I saw you at the concert the other\r\nnight, dressed, actually, like anybody else. Who is your tailleuse?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTittle-tattle: how prettily it begins! My tailleuse!\u2014a fiddlestick! Come,\r\nsheer off, Ginevra. I really don\u2019t want your company.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut when I want yours so much, ange farouche, what does a little reluctance on\r\nyour part signify? Dieu merci! we know how to man\u0153uvre with our gifted\r\ncompatriote\u2014the learned \u2018ourse Britannique.\u2019 And so, Ourson, you know Isidore?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know John Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush!\u201d (putting her fingers in her ears) \u201cyou crack my tympanums with your\r\nrude Anglicisms. But, how is our well-beloved John? Do tell me about him. The\r\npoor man must be in a sad way. What did he say to my behaviour the other night?\r\nWasn\u2019t I cruel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you think I noticed you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was a delightful evening. Oh, that divine de Hamal! And then to watch the\r\nother sulking and dying in the distance; and the old lady\u2014my future\r\nmamma-in-law! But I am afraid I and Lady Sara were a little rude in quizzing\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLady Sara never quizzed her at all; and for what you did, don\u2019t make\r\nyourself in the least uneasy: Mrs. Bretton will survive your sneer.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe may: old ladies are tough; but that poor son of hers! Do tell me what he\r\nsaid: I saw he was terribly cut up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe said you looked as if at heart you were already Madame de Hamal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he?\u201d she cried with delight. \u201cHe noticed that? How charming! I thought he\r\nwould be mad with jealousy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinevra, have you seriously done with Dr. Bretton? Do you want him to give you\r\nup?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! you know he can\u2019t do that: but wasn\u2019t he mad?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite mad,\u201d I assented; \u201cas mad as a March hare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and how ever did you get him home?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow ever, indeed! Have you no pity on his poor mother and me? Fancy us\r\nholding him tight down in the carriage, and he raving between us, fit to drive\r\neverybody delirious. The very coachman went wrong, somehow, and we lost our\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so? You are laughing at me. Now, Lucy Snowe\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI assure you it is fact\u2014and fact, also, that Dr. Bretton would not stay\r\nin the carriage: he broke from us, and would ride outside.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAfterwards\u2014when he did reach home\u2014the scene transcends description.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, but describe it\u2014you know it is such fun!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFun for you, Miss Fanshawe? but\u201d (with stern gravity) \u201cyou know the\r\nproverb\u2014\u2018What is sport to one may be death to another.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo on, there\u2019s a darling Timon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConscientiously, I cannot, unless you assure me you have some heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have\u2014such an immensity, you don\u2019t know!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood! In that case, you will be able to conceive Dr. Graham Bretton rejecting\r\nhis supper in the first instance\u2014the chicken, the sweetbread prepared for his\r\nrefreshment, left on the table untouched. Then\u2014\u2014but it is of no use dwelling at\r\nlength on the harrowing details. Suffice it to say, that never, in the most\r\nstormy fits and moments of his infancy, had his mother such work to tuck the\r\nsheets about him as she had that night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t lie still?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t lie still: there it was. The sheets might be tucked in, but the\r\nthing was to keep them tucked in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay! Can\u2019t you imagine him demanding his divine Ginevra, anathematizing that\r\ndemon, de Hamal\u2014raving about golden locks, blue eyes, white arms, glittering\r\nbracelets?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, did he? He saw the bracelet?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSaw the bracelet? Yes, as plain as I saw it: and, perhaps, for the first time,\r\nhe saw also the brand-mark with which its pressure has encircled your arm.\r\nGinevra\u201d (rising, and changing my tone), \u201ccome, we will have an end of this. Go\r\naway to your practising.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I opened the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you have not told me all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou had better not wait until I do tell you all. Such extra\r\ncommunicativeness could give you no pleasure. March!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCross thing!\u201d said she; but she obeyed: and, indeed, the first classe was my\r\nterritory, and she could not there legally resist a notice of quittance from\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\nYet, to speak the truth, never had I been less dissatisfied with her than I was\r\nthen. There was pleasure in thinking of the contrast between the reality and my\r\ndescription\u2014to remember Dr. John enjoying the drive home, eating his supper\r\nwith relish, and retiring to rest with Christian composure. It was only when I\r\nsaw him really unhappy that I felt really vexed with the fair, frail cause of\r\nhis suffering.\r\n\n\r\nA fortnight passed; I was getting once more inured to the harness of school,\r\nand lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of custom. One\r\nafternoon, in crossing the carr\u00e9, on my way to the first classe, where I was\r\nexpected to assist at a lesson of \u201cstyle and literature,\u201d I saw, standing by\r\none of the long and large windows, Rosine, the portress. Her attitude, as\r\nusual, was quite nonchalante. She always \u201cstood at ease;\u201d one of her hands\r\nrested in her apron-pocket, the other at this moment held to her eyes a letter,\r\nwhereof Mademoiselle coolly perused the address, and deliberately studied the\r\nseal.\r\n\n\r\nA letter! The shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in its\r\nvery core for seven days past. I had dreamed of a letter last night. Strong\r\nmagnetism drew me to that letter now; yet, whether I should have ventured to\r\ndemand of Rosine so much as a glance at that white envelope, with the spot of\r\nred wax in the middle, I know not. No; I think I should have sneaked past in\r\nterror of a rebuff from Disappointment: my heart throbbed now as if I already\r\nheard the tramp of her approach. Nervous mistake! It was the rapid step of the\r\nProfessor of Literature measuring the corridor. I fled before him. Could I but\r\nbe seated quietly at my desk before his arrival, with the class under my orders\r\nall in disciplined readiness, he would, perhaps, exempt me from notice; but, if\r\ncaught lingering in the carr\u00e9, I should be sure to come in for a special\r\nharangue. I had time to get seated, to enforce perfect silence, to take out my\r\nwork, and to commence it amidst the profoundest and best trained hush, ere M.\r\nEmanuel entered with his vehement burst of latch and panel, and his deep,\r\nredundant bow, prophetic of choler.\r\n\n\r\nAs usual he broke upon us like a clap of thunder; but instead of flashing\r\nlightning-wise from the door to the estrade, his career halted midway at my\r\ndesk. Setting his face towards me and the window, his back to the pupils and\r\nthe room, he gave me a look\u2014such a look as might have licensed me to stand\r\nstraight up and demand what he meant\u2014a look of scowling distrust.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoil\u00e0! pour vous,\u201d said he, drawing his hand from his waist-coat, and placing\r\non my desk a letter\u2014the very letter I had seen in Rosine\u2019s hand\u2014the letter\r\nwhose face of enamelled white and single Cyclop\u2019s-eye of vermilion-red had\r\nprinted themselves so clear and perfect on the retina of an inward vision. I\r\nknew it, I felt it to be the letter of my hope, the fruition of my wish, the\r\nrelease from my doubt, the ransom from my terror. This letter M. Paul, with his\r\nunwarrantably interfering habits, had taken from the portress, and now\r\ndelivered it himself.\r\n\n\r\nI might have been angry, but had not a second for the sensation. Yes: I held in\r\nmy hand not a slight note, but an envelope, which must, at least, contain a\r\nsheet: it felt not flimsy, but firm, substantial, satisfying. And here was the\r\ndirection, \u201cMiss Lucy Snowe,\u201d in a clean, clear, equal, decided hand; and here\r\nwas the seal, round, full, deftly dropped by untremulous fingers, stamped with\r\nthe well-cut impress of initials, \u201cJ. G. B.\u201d I experienced a happy feeling\u2014a\r\nglad emotion which went warm to my heart, and ran lively through all my veins.\r\nFor once a hope was realized. I held in my hand a morsel of real solid joy: not\r\na dream, not an image of the brain, not one of those shadowy chances\r\nimagination pictures, and on which humanity starves but cannot live; not a mess\r\nof that manna I drearily eulogized awhile ago\u2014which, indeed, at first melts on\r\nthe lips with an unspeakable and preternatural sweetness, but which, in the\r\nend, our souls full surely loathe; longing deliriously for natural and\r\nearth-grown food, wildly praying Heaven\u2019s Spirits to reclaim their own\r\nspirit-dew and essence\u2014an aliment divine, but for mortals deadly. It was\r\nneither sweet hail nor small coriander-seed\u2014neither slight wafer, nor luscious\r\nhoney, I had lighted on; it was the wild, savoury mess of the hunter,\r\nnourishing and salubrious meat, forest-fed or desert-reared, fresh, healthful,\r\nand life-sustaining. It was what the old dying patriarch demanded of his son\r\nEsau, promising in requital the blessing of his last breath. It was a godsend;\r\nand I inwardly thanked the God who had vouchsafed it. Outwardly I only thanked\r\nman, crying, \u201cThank you, thank you, Monsieur!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMonsieur curled his lip, gave me a vicious glance of the eye, and strode to his\r\nestrade. M. Paul was not at all a good little man, though he had good points.\r\n\n\r\nDid I read my letter there and then? Did I consume the venison at once and with\r\nhaste, as if Esau\u2019s shaft flew every day?\r\n\n\r\nI knew better. The cover with its address\u2014the seal, with its three clear\r\nletters\u2014was bounty and abundance for the present. I stole from the room, I\r\nprocured the key of the great dormitory, which was kept locked by day. I went\r\nto my bureau; with a sort of haste and trembling lest Madame should creep\r\nup-stairs and spy me, I opened a drawer, unlocked a box, and took out a case,\r\nand\u2014having feasted my eyes with one more look, and approached the seal with a\r\nmixture of awe and shame and delight, to my lips\u2014I folded the untasted\r\ntreasure, yet all fair and inviolate, in silver paper, committed it to the\r\ncase, shut up box and drawer, reclosed, relocked the dormitory, and returned to\r\nclass, feeling as if fairy tales were true, and fairy gifts no dream. Strange,\r\nsweet insanity! And this letter, the source of my joy, I had not yet read: did\r\nnot yet know the number of its lines.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I re-entered the schoolroom, behold M. Paul raging like a pestilence! Some\r\npupil had not spoken audibly or distinctly enough to suit his ear and taste,\r\nand now she and others were weeping, and he was raving from his estrade, almost\r\nlivid. Curious to mention, as I appeared, he fell on me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas I the mistress of these girls? Did I profess to teach them the conduct\r\nbefitting ladies?\u2014and did I permit and, he doubted not, encourage them to\r\nstrangle their mother-tongue in their throats, to mince and mash it between\r\ntheir teeth, as if they had some base cause to be ashamed of the words they\r\nuttered? Was this modesty? He knew better. It was a vile pseudo sentiment\u2014the\r\noffspring or the forerunner of evil. Rather than submit to this mopping and\r\nmowing, this mincing and grimacing, this, grinding of a noble tongue, this\r\ngeneral affectation and sickening stubbornness of the pupils of the first\r\nclass, he would throw them up for a set of insupportable petites ma\u00eetresses,\r\nand confine himself to teaching the ABC to the babies of the third division.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat could I say to all this? Really nothing; and I hoped he would allow me to\r\nbe silent. The storm recommenced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEvery answer to his queries was then refused? It seemed to be considered in\r\nthat place\u2014that conceited boudoir of a first classe, with its\r\npretentious book-cases, its green-baized desks, its rubbish of flower-stands,\r\nits trash of framed pictures and maps, and its foreign surveillante,\r\nforsooth!\u2014it seemed to be the fashion to think there that the Professor\r\nof Literature was not worthy of a reply! These were new ideas; imported, he did\r\nnot doubt, straight from \u2018la Grande Bretagne:\u2019 they savoured of island\r\ninsolence and arrogance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nLull the second\u2014the girls, not one of whom was ever known to weep a tear for\r\nthe rebukes of any other master, now all melting like snow-statues before the\r\nintemperate heat of M. Emanuel: I not yet much shaken, sitting down, and\r\nventuring to resume my work.\r\n\n\r\nSomething\u2014either in my continued silence or in the movement of my hand,\r\nstitching\u2014transported M. Emanuel beyond the last boundary of patience; he\r\nactually sprang from his estrade. The stove stood near my desk, he attacked it;\r\nthe little iron door was nearly dashed from its hinges, the fuel was made to\r\nfly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce que vous avez l\u2019intention de m\u2019insulter?\u201d said he to me, in a low,\r\nfurious voice, as he thus outraged, under pretence of arranging the fire.\r\n\n\r\nIt was time to soothe him a little if possible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, Monsieur,\u201d said I, \u201cI would not insult you for the world. I remember too\r\nwell that you once said we should be friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI did not intend my voice to falter, but it did: more, I think, through the\r\nagitation of late delight than in any spasm of present fear. Still there\r\ncertainly was something in M. Paul\u2019s anger\u2014a kind of passion of emotion\u2014that\r\nspecially tended to draw tears. I was not unhappy, nor much afraid, yet I wept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAllons, allons!\u201d said he presently, looking round and seeing the deluge\r\nuniversal. \u201cDecidedly I am a monster and a ruffian. I have only one\r\npocket-handkerchief,\u201d he added, \u201cbut if I had twenty, I would offer you each\r\none. Your teacher shall be your representative. Here, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he took forth and held out to me a clean silk handkerchief. Now a person\r\nwho did not know M. Paul, who was unused to him and his impulses, would\r\nnaturally have bungled at this offer\u2014declined accepting the same\u2014et cetera. But\r\nI too plainly felt this would never do: the slightest hesitation would have\r\nbeen fatal to the incipient treaty of peace. I rose and met the handkerchief\r\nhalf-way, received it with decorum, wiped therewith my eyes, and, resuming my\r\nseat, and retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on my lap, took especial\r\ncare during the remainder of the lesson to touch neither needle nor thimble,\r\nscissors nor muslin. Many a jealous glance did M. Paul cast at these\r\nimplements; he hated them mortally, considering sewing a source of distraction\r\nfrom the attention due to himself. A very eloquent lesson he gave, and very\r\nkind and friendly was he to the close. Ere he had done, the clouds were\r\ndispersed and the sun shining out\u2014tears were exchanged for smiles.\r\n\n\r\nIn quitting the room he paused once more at my desk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your letter?\u201d said he, this time not quite fiercely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not yet read it, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! it is too good to read at once; you save it, as, when I was a boy, I used\r\nto save a peach whose bloom was very ripe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe guess came so near the truth, I could not prevent a suddenly-rising warmth\r\nin my face from revealing as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou promise yourself a pleasant moment,\u201d said he, \u201cin reading that letter; you\r\nwill open it when alone\u2014n\u2019est-ce pas? Ah! a smile answers. Well, well! one\r\nshould not be too harsh; \u2018la jeunesse n\u2019a qu\u2019un temps.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, Monsieur!\u201d I cried, or rather whispered after him, as he turned to\r\ngo, \u201cdo not leave me under a mistake. This is merely a friend\u2019s letter. Without\r\nreading it, I can vouch for that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe con\u00e7ois, je con\u00e7ois: on sait ce que c\u2019est qu\u2019un ami. Bonjour,\r\nMademoiselle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Monsieur, here is your handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep it, keep it, till the letter is read, then bring it me; I shall read the\r\nbillet\u2019s tenor in your eyes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen he was gone, the pupils having already poured out of the schoolroom into\r\nthe berceau, and thence into the garden and court to take their customary\r\nrecreation before the five-o\u2019clock dinner, I stood a moment thinking, and\r\nabsently twisting the handkerchief round my arm. For some reason\u2014gladdened, I\r\nthink, by a sudden return of the golden glimmer of childhood, roused by an\r\nunwonted renewal of its buoyancy, made merry by the liberty of the closing\r\nhour, and, above all, solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that\r\ntreasure in the case, box, drawer up-stairs,\u2014I fell to playing with the\r\nhandkerchief as if it were a ball, casting it into the air and catching it\u2014as\r\nit fell. The game was stopped by another hand than mine\u2014a hand emerging from a\r\npalet\u00f4t-sleeve and stretched over my shoulder; it caught the extemporised\r\nplaything and bore it away with these sullen words:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes effets.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nReally that little man was dreadful: a mere sprite of caprice and, ubiquity:\r\none never knew either his whim or his whereabout.\r\n\n"}
{"23": "\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE LETTER.\n\r\nWhen all was still in the house; when dinner was over and the noisy\r\nrecreation-hour past; when darkness had set in, and the quiet lamp of study was\r\nlit in the refectory; when the externes were gone home, the clashing door and\r\nclamorous bell hushed for the evening; when Madame was safely settled in the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger in company with her mother and some friends; I then glided to\r\nthe kitchen, begged a bougie for one half-hour for a particular occasion, found\r\nacceptance of my petition at the hands of my friend Goton, who answered, \u201cMais\r\ncertainement, chou-chou, vous en aurez deux, si vous voulez;\u201d and, light in\r\nhand, I mounted noiseless to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\nGreat was my chagrin to find in that apartment a pupil gone to bed\r\nindisposed,\u2014greater when I recognised, amid the muslin nightcap borders, the\r\n\u201cfigure chiffonn\u00e9e\u201d of Mistress Ginevra Fanshawe; supine at this moment, it is\r\ntrue\u2014but certain to wake and overwhelm me with chatter when the interruption\r\nwould be least acceptable: indeed, as I watched her, a slight twinkling of the\r\neyelids warned me that the present appearance of repose might be but a ruse,\r\nassumed to cover sly vigilance over \u201cTimon\u2019s\u201d movements; she was not to be\r\ntrusted. And I had so wished to be alone, just to read my precious letter in\r\npeace.\r\n\n\r\nWell, I must go to the classes. Having sought and found my prize in its casket,\r\nI descended. Ill-luck pursued me. The classes were undergoing sweeping and\r\npurification by candle-light, according to hebdomadal custom: benches were\r\npiled on desks, the air was dim with dust, damp coffee-grounds (used by\r\nLabassecourien housemaids instead of tea-leaves) darkened the floor; all was\r\nhopeless confusion. Baffled, but not beaten, I withdrew, bent as resolutely as\r\never on finding solitude somewhere.\r\n\n\r\nTaking a key whereof I knew the repository, I mounted three staircases in\r\nsuccession, reached a dark, narrow, silent landing, opened a worm-eaten door,\r\nand dived into the deep, black, cold garret. Here none would follow me\u2014none\r\ninterrupt\u2014not Madame herself. I shut the garret-door; I placed my light on a\r\ndoddered and mouldy chest of drawers; I put on a shawl, for the air was\r\nice-cold; I took my letter; trembling with sweet impatience, I broke its seal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill it be long\u2014will it be short?\u201d thought I, passing my hand across my eyes\r\nto dissipate the silvery dimness of a suave, south-wind shower.\r\n\n\r\nIt was long.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill it be cool?\u2014will it be kind?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was kind.\r\n\n\r\nTo my checked, bridled, disciplined expectation, it seemed very kind: to my\r\nlonging and famished thought it seemed, perhaps, kinder than it was.\r\n\n\r\nSo little had I hoped, so much had I feared; there was a fulness of delight in\r\nthis taste of fruition\u2014such, perhaps, as many a human being passes through life\r\nwithout ever knowing. The poor English teacher in the frosty garret, reading by\r\na dim candle guttering in the wintry air, a letter simply good-natured\u2014nothing\r\nmore; though that good-nature then seemed to me godlike\u2014was happier than most\r\nqueens in palaces.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, happiness of such shallow origin could be but brief; yet, while it\r\nlasted it was genuine and exquisite: a bubble\u2014but a sweet bubble\u2014of real\r\nhoney-dew. Dr. John had written to me at length; he had written to me with\r\npleasure; he had written with benignant mood, dwelling with sunny satisfaction\r\non scenes that had passed before his eyes and mine,\u2014on places we had visited\r\ntogether\u2014on conversations we had held\u2014on all the little subject-matter, in\r\nshort, of the last few halcyon weeks. But the cordial core of the delight was,\r\na conviction the blithe, genial language generously imparted, that it had been\r\npoured out not merely to content me\u2014but to gratify himself. A\r\ngratification he might never more desire, never more seek\u2014an hypothesis in\r\nevery point of view approaching the certain; but that concerned the\r\nfuture. This present moment had no pain, no blot, no want; full, pure, perfect,\r\nit deeply blessed me. A passing seraph seemed to have rested beside me, leaned\r\ntowards my heart, and reposed on its throb a softening, cooling, healing,\r\nhallowing wing. Dr. John, you pained me afterwards: forgiven be every\r\nill\u2014freely forgiven\u2014for the sake of that one dear remembered good!\r\n\n\r\nAre there wicked things, not human, which envy human bliss? Are there evil\r\ninfluences haunting the air, and poisoning it for man? What was near me?\r\n\n\r\nSomething in that vast solitary garret sounded strangely. Most surely and\r\ncertainly I heard, as it seemed, a stealthy foot on that floor: a sort of\r\ngliding out from the direction of the black recess haunted by the malefactor\r\ncloaks. I turned: my light was dim; the room was long\u2014but as I live! I saw in\r\nthe middle of that ghostly chamber a figure all black and white; the skirts\r\nstraight, narrow, black; the head bandaged, veiled, white.\r\n\n\r\nSay what you will, reader\u2014tell me I was nervous or mad; affirm that I was\r\nunsettled by the excitement of that letter; declare that I dreamed; this I\r\nvow\u2014I saw there\u2014in that room\u2014on that night\u2014an image like\u2014a NUN.\r\n\n\r\nI cried out; I sickened. Had the shape approached me I might have swooned. It\r\nreceded: I made for the door. How I descended all the stairs I know not. By\r\ninstinct I shunned the refectory, and shaped my course to Madame\u2019s\r\nsitting-room: I burst in. I said\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in the grenier; I have been there: I saw something. Go and\r\nlook at it, all of you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, \u201cAll of you;\u201d for the room seemed to me full of people, though in truth\r\nthere were but four present: Madame Beck; her mother, Madame Kint, who was out\r\nof health, and now staying with her on a visit; her brother, M. Victor Kint,\r\nand another gentleman, who, when I entered the room, was conversing with the\r\nold lady, and had his back towards the door.\r\n\n\r\nMy mortal fear and faintness must have made me deadly pale. I felt cold and\r\nshaking. They all rose in consternation; they surrounded me. I urged them to go\r\nto the grenier; the sight of the gentlemen did me good and gave me courage: it\r\nseemed as if there were some help and hope, with men at hand. I turned to the\r\ndoor, beckoning them to follow. They wanted to stop me, but I said they must\r\ncome this way: they must see what I had seen\u2014something strange, standing in the\r\nmiddle of the garret. And, now, I remembered my letter, left on the drawers\r\nwith the light. This precious letter! Flesh or spirit must be defied for its\r\nsake. I flew up-stairs, hastening the faster as I knew I was followed: they\r\nwere obliged to come.\r\n\n\r\nLo! when I reached the garret-door, all within was dark as a pit: the light was\r\nout. Happily some one\u2014Madame, I think, with her usual calm sense\u2014had brought a\r\nlamp from the room; speedily, therefore, as they came up, a ray pierced the\r\nopaque blackness. There stood the bougie quenched on the drawers; but where was\r\nthe letter? And I looked for that now, and not for the nun.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy letter! my letter!\u201d I panted and plained, almost beside myself. I groped on\r\nthe floor, wringing my hands wildly. Cruel, cruel doom! To have my bit of\r\ncomfort preternaturally snatched from me, ere I had well tasted its virtue!\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what the others were doing; I could not watch them: they asked me\r\nquestions I did not answer; they ransacked all corners; they prattled about\r\nthis and that disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or crack in the sky-light\u2014I\r\nknow not what. \u201cSomething or somebody has been here,\u201d was sagely averred.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! they have taken my letter!\u201d cried the grovelling, groping, monomaniac.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?\u201d asked a known voice in my ear.\r\nCould I believe that ear? No: and I looked up. Could I trust my eyes? Had I\r\nrecognised the tone? Did I now look on the face of the writer of that very\r\nletter? Was this gentleman near me in this dim garret, John Graham\u2014Dr. Bretton\r\nhimself?\r\n\n\r\nYes: it was. He had been called in that very evening to prescribe for some\r\naccess of illness in old Madame Kint; he was the second gentleman present in\r\nthe salle-\u00e0-manger when I entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it my letter, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour own: yours\u2014the letter you wrote to me. I had come here to read it\r\nquietly. I could not find another spot where it was possible to have it to\r\nmyself. I had saved it all day\u2014never opened it till this evening: it was\r\nscarcely glanced over: I cannot bear to lose it. Oh, my letter!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHush! don\u2019t cry and distress yourself so cruelly. What is it worth? Hush! Come\r\nout of this cold room; they are going to send for the police now to examine\r\nfurther: we need not stay here\u2014come, we will go down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA warm hand, taking my cold fingers, led me down to a room where there was a\r\nfire. Dr. John and I sat before the stove. He talked to me and soothed me with\r\nunutterable goodness, promising me twenty letters for the one lost. If there\r\nare words and wrongs like knives, whose deep-inflicted lacerations never\r\nheal\u2014cutting injuries and insults of serrated and poison-dripping edge\u2014so, too,\r\nthere are consolations of tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever to\r\nretain their echo: caressing kindnesses\u2014loved, lingered over through a whole\r\nlife, recalled with unfaded tenderness, and answering the call with undimmed\r\nshine, out of that raven cloud foreshadowing Death himself. I have been told\r\nsince that Dr. Bretton was not nearly so perfect as I thought him: that his\r\nactual character lacked the depth, height, compass, and endurance it possessed\r\nin my creed. I don\u2019t know: he was as good to me as the well is to the parched\r\nwayfarer\u2014as the sun to the shivering jailbird. I remember him heroic. Heroic at\r\nthis moment will I hold him to be.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked me, smiling, why I cared for his letter so very much. I thought, but\r\ndid not say, that I prized it like the blood in my veins. I only answered that\r\nI had so few letters to care for.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure you did not read it,\u201d said he; \u201cor you would think nothing of it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read it, but only once. I want to read it again. I am sorry it is lost.\u201d And\r\nI could not help weeping afresh.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, Lucy, my poor little god-sister (if there be such a relationship),\r\nhere\u2014here is your letter. Why is it not better worth such tears, and\r\nsuch tenderly exaggerating faith?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nCurious, characteristic man\u0153uvre! His quick eye had seen the letter on the\r\nfloor where I sought it; his hand, as quick, had snatched it up. He had hidden\r\nit in his waistcoat pocket. If my trouble had wrought with a whit less stress\r\nand reality, I doubt whether he would ever have acknowledged or restored it.\r\nTears of temperature one degree cooler than those I shed would only have amused\r\nDr. John.\r\n\n\r\nPleasure at regaining made me forget merited reproach for the teasing torment;\r\nmy joy was great; it could not be concealed: yet I think it broke out more in\r\ncountenance than language. I said little.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d asked Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I was\u2014satisfied and happy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d he proceeded, \u201chow do you feel physically? Are you growing calmer?\r\nNot much: for you tremble like a leaf still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed to me, however, that I was sufficiently calm: at least I felt no\r\nlonger terrified. I expressed myself composed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are able, consequently, to tell me what you saw? Your account was quite\r\nvague, do you know? You looked white as the wall; but you only spoke of\r\n\u2018something,\u2019 not defining what. Was it a man? Was it an animal? What was\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI never will tell exactly what I saw,\u201d said I, \u201cunless some one else sees it\r\ntoo, and then I will give corroborative testimony; but otherwise, I shall be\r\ndiscredited and accused of dreaming.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said Dr. Bretton; \u201cI will hear it in my professional character: I\r\nlook on you now from a professional point of view, and I read, perhaps, all you\r\nwould conceal\u2014in your eye, which is curiously vivid and restless: in your\r\ncheek, which the blood has forsaken; in your hand, which you cannot steady.\r\nCome, Lucy, speak and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou would laugh\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me you shall have no more letters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are laughing now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will again take away that single epistle: being mine, I think I have a right\r\nto reclaim it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI felt raillery in his words: it made me grave and quiet; but I folded up the\r\nletter and covered it from sight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may hide it, but I can possess it any moment I choose. You don\u2019t know my\r\nskill in sleight of hand; I might practise as a conjuror if I liked. Mamma says\r\nsometimes, too, that I have a harmonizing property of tongue and eye; but you\r\nnever saw that in me\u2014did you, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed\u2014indeed\u2014when you were a mere boy I used to see both: far more then than\r\nnow\u2014for now you are strong, and strength dispenses with subtlety. But\r\nstill,\u2014Dr. John, you have what they call in this country \u2018un air fin,\u2019 that\r\nnobody can mistake. Madame Beck saw it, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd liked it,\u201d said he, laughing, \u201cbecause she has it herself. But, Lucy, give\r\nme that letter\u2014you don\u2019t really care for it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo this provocative speech I made no answer. Graham in mirthful mood must not\r\nbe humoured too far. Just now there was a new sort of smile playing about his\r\nlips\u2014very sweet, but it grieved me somehow\u2014a new sort of light sparkling in his\r\neyes: not hostile, but not reassuring. I rose to go\u2014I bid him good-night a\r\nlittle sadly.\r\n\n\r\nHis sensitiveness\u2014that peculiar, apprehensive, detective faculty of his\u2014felt in\r\na moment the unspoken complaint\u2014the scarce-thought reproach. He asked quietly\r\nif I was offended. I shook my head as implying a negative.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPermit me, then, to speak a little seriously to you before you go. You are in\r\na highly nervous state. I feel sure from what is apparent in your look and\r\nmanner, however well controlled, that whilst alone this evening in that dismal,\r\nperishing sepulchral garret\u2014that dungeon under the leads, smelling of damp and\r\nmould, rank with phthisis and catarrh: a place you never ought to enter\u2014that\r\nyou saw, or thought you saw, some appearance peculiarly calculated to\r\nimpress the imagination. I know that you are not, nor ever were, subject\r\nto material terrors, fears of robbers, &c.\u2014I am not so sure that a\r\nvisitation, bearing a spectral character, would not shake your very mind. Be\r\ncalm now. This is all a matter of the nerves, I see: but just specify the\r\nvision.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell nobody?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNobody\u2014most certainly. You may trust me as implicitly as you did P\u00e8re Silas.\r\nIndeed, the doctor is perhaps the safer confessor of the two, though he has not\r\ngrey hair.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will not laugh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I may, to do you good: but not in scorn. Lucy, I feel as a friend\r\ntowards you, though your timid nature is slow to trust.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe now looked like a friend: that indescribable smile and sparkle were gone;\r\nthose formidable arched curves of lip, nostril, eyebrow, were depressed; repose\r\nmarked his attitude\u2014attention sobered his aspect. Won to confidence, I told him\r\nexactly what I had seen: ere now I had narrated to him the legend of the\r\nhouse\u2014whiling away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild October\r\nafternoon, when he and I rode through Bois l\u2019Etang.\r\n\n\r\nHe sat and thought, and while he thought, we heard them all coming down-stairs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre they going to interrupt?\u201d said he, glancing at the door with an annoyed\r\nexpression.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey will not come here,\u201d I answered; for we were in the little salon where\r\nMadame never sat in the evening, and where it was by mere chance that heat was\r\nstill lingering in the stove. They passed the door and went on to the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he pursued, \u201cthey will talk about thieves, burglars, and so on: let them\r\ndo so\u2014mind you say nothing, and keep your resolution of describing your nun to\r\nnobody. She may appear to you again: don\u2019t start.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think then,\u201d I said, with secret horror, \u201cshe came out of my brain, and is\r\nnow gone in there, and may glide out again at an hour and a day when I look not\r\nfor her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think it a case of spectral illusion: I fear, following on and resulting\r\nfrom long-continued mental conflict.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Doctor John\u2014I shudder at the thought of being liable to such an illusion!\r\nIt seemed so real. Is there no cure?\u2014no preventive?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHappiness is the cure\u2014a cheerful mind the preventive: cultivate both.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to\r\ncultivate happiness. What does such advice mean? Happiness is not a\r\npotato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory\r\nshining far down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on\r\ncertain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom\r\nand golden fruitage of Paradise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCultivate happiness!\u201d I said briefly to the doctor: \u201cdo you cultivate\r\nhappiness? How do you manage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a cheerful fellow by nature: and then ill-luck has never dogged me.\r\nAdversity gave me and my mother one passing scowl and brush, but we defied her,\r\nor rather laughed at her, and she went by.\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is no cultivation in all this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not give way to melancholy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: I have seen you subdued by that feeling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout Ginevra Fanshawe\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid she not sometimes make you miserable?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh! stuff! nonsense! You see I am better now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIf a laughing eye with a lively light, and a face bright with beaming and\r\nhealthy energy, could attest that he was better, better he certainly was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do not look much amiss, or greatly out of condition,\u201d I allowed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why, Lucy, can\u2019t you look and feel as I do\u2014buoyant, courageous, and fit to\r\ndefy all the nuns and flirts in Christendom? I would give gold on the spot just\r\nto see you snap your fingers. Try the man\u0153uvre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to bring Miss Fanshawe into your presence just now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI vow, Lucy, she should not move me: or, she should move me but by one\r\nthing\u2014true, yes, and passionate love. I would accord forgiveness at no less a\r\nprice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! a smile of hers would have been a fortune to you a while since.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTransformed, Lucy: transformed! Remember, you once called me a slave! but I am\r\na free man now!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stood up: in the port of his head, the carriage of his figure, in his\r\nbeaming eye and mien, there revealed itself a liberty which was more than\r\nease\u2014a mood which was disdain of his past bondage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Fanshawe,\u201d he pursued, \u201chas led me through a phase of feeling which is\r\nover: I have entered another condition, and am now much disposed to exact love\r\nfor love\u2014passion for passion\u2014and good measure of it, too.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, Doctor! Doctor! you said it was your nature to pursue Love under\r\ndifficulties\u2014to be charmed by a proud insensibility!\u201d.\r\n\n\r\nHe laughed, and answered, \u201cMy nature varies: the mood of one hour is sometimes\r\nthe mockery of the next. Well, Lucy\u201d (drawing on his gloves), \u201cwill the Nun\r\ncome again to-night, think you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive her my compliments, if she does\u2014Dr. John\u2019s compliments\u2014and entreat her to\r\nhave the goodness to wait a visit from him. Lucy, was she a pretty nun? Had she\r\na pretty face? You have not told me that yet; and that is the really\r\nimportant point.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe had a white cloth over her face,\u201d said I, \u201cbut her eyes glittered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConfusion to her goblin trappings!\u201d cried he, irreverently: \u201cbut at least she\r\nhad handsome eyes\u2014bright and soft.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCold and fixed,\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, we\u2019ll none of her: she shall not haunt you, Lucy. Give her that shake\r\nof the hand, if she comes again. Will she stand that, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought it too kind and cordial for a ghost to stand: and so was the smile\r\nwhich matched it, and accompanied his \u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd had there been anything in the garret? What did they discover? I believe,\r\non the closest examination, their discoveries amounted to very little. They\r\ntalked, at first, of the cloaks being disturbed; but Madame Beck told me\r\nafterwards she thought they hung much as usual: and as for the broken pane in\r\nthe skylight, she affirmed that aperture was rarely without one or more panes\r\nbroken or cracked: and besides, a heavy hail-storm had fallen a few days ago.\r\nMadame questioned me very closely as to what I had seen, but I only described\r\nan obscure figure clothed in black: I took care not to breathe the word \u201cnun,\u201d\r\ncertain that this word would at once suggest to her mind an idea of romance and\r\nunreality. She charged me to say nothing on the subject to any servant, pupil,\r\nor teacher, and highly commended my discretion in coming to her private\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger, instead of carrying the tale of horror to the school refectory.\r\nThus the subject dropped. I was left secretly and sadly to wonder, in my own\r\nmind, whether that strange thing was of this world, or of a realm beyond the\r\ngrave; or whether indeed it was only the child of malady, and I of that malady\r\nthe prey.\r\n\n"}
{"24": "\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nVASHTI.\n\r\nTo wonder sadly, did I say? No: a new influence began to act upon my life, and\r\nsadness, for a certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a dell, deep-hollowed\r\nin forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its turf is dank, its herbage\r\npale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a wide gap amongst the oak-trees; the\r\nbreeze sweeps in; the sun looks down; the sad, cold dell becomes a deep cup of\r\nlustre; high summer pours her blue glory and her golden light out of that\r\nbeauteous sky, which till now the starved hollow never saw.\r\n\n\r\nA new creed became mine\u2014a belief in happiness.\r\n\n\r\nIt was three weeks since the adventure of the garret, and I possessed in that\r\ncase, box, drawer up-stairs, casketed with that first letter, four companions\r\nlike to it, traced by the same firm pen, sealed with the same clear seal, full\r\nof the same vital comfort. Vital comfort it seemed to me then: I read them in\r\nafter years; they were kind letters enough\u2014pleasing letters, because composed\r\nby one well pleased; in the two last there were three or four closing lines\r\nhalf-gay, half-tender, \u201cby feeling touched, but not subdued.\u201d Time, dear\r\nreader, mellowed them to a beverage of this mild quality; but when I first\r\ntasted their elixir, fresh from the fount so honoured, it seemed juice of a\r\ndivine vintage: a draught which Hebe might fill, and the very gods approve.\r\n\n\r\nDoes the reader, remembering what was said some pages back, care to ask how I\r\nanswered these letters: whether under the dry, stinting check of Reason, or\r\naccording to the full, liberal impulse of Feeling?\r\n\n\r\nTo speak truth, I compromised matters; I served two masters: I bowed down in\r\nthe houses of Rimmon, and lifted the heart at another shrine. I wrote to these\r\nletters two answers\u2014one for my own relief, the other for Graham\u2019s perusal.\r\n\n\r\nTo begin with: Feeling and I turned Reason out of doors, drew against her bar\r\nand bolt, then we sat down, spread our paper, dipped in the ink an eager pen,\r\nand, with deep enjoyment, poured out our sincere heart. When we had done\u2014when\r\ntwo sheets were covered with the language of a strongly-adherent affection, a\r\nrooted and active gratitude\u2014(once, for all, in this parenthesis, I disclaim,\r\nwith the utmost scorn, every sneaking suspicion of what are called \u201cwarmer\r\nfeelings:\u201d women do not entertain these \u201cwarmer feelings\u201d where, from the\r\ncommencement, through the whole progress of an acquaintance, they have never\r\nonce been cheated of the conviction that, to do so would be to commit a mortal\r\nabsurdity: nobody ever launches into Love unless he has seen or dreamed the\r\nrising of Hope\u2019s star over Love\u2019s troubled waters)\u2014when, then, I had given\r\nexpression to a closely-clinging and deeply-honouring attachment\u2014an attachment\r\nthat wanted to attract to itself and take to its own lot all that was painful\r\nin the destiny of its object; that would, if it could, have absorbed and\r\nconducted away all storms and lightnings from an existence viewed with a\r\npassion of solicitude\u2014then, just at that moment, the doors of my heart would\r\nshake, bolt and bar would yield, Reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful,\r\nsnatch the full sheets, read, sneer, erase, tear up, re-write, fold, seal,\r\ndirect, and send a terse, curt missive of a page. She did right.\r\n\n\r\nI did not live on letters only: I was visited, I was looked after; once a week\r\nI was taken out to La Terrasse; always I was made much of. Dr. Bretton failed\r\nnot to tell me why he was so kind: \u201cTo keep away the nun,\u201d he said; \u201che\r\nwas determined to dispute with her her prey. He had taken,\u201d he declared, \u201ca\r\nthorough dislike to her, chiefly on account of that white face-cloth, and those\r\ncold grey eyes: the moment he heard of those odious particulars,\u201d he affirmed,\r\n\u201cconsummate disgust had incited him to oppose her; he was determined to try\r\nwhether he or she was the cleverest, and he only wished she would once more\r\nlook in upon me when he was present:\u201d but that she never did. In short,\r\nhe regarded me scientifically in the light of a patient, and at once exercised\r\nhis professional skill, and gratified his natural benevolence, by a course of\r\ncordial and attentive treatment.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, the first in December, I was walking by myself in the carr\u00e9; it\r\nwas six o\u2019clock; the classe-doors were closed; but within, the pupils, rampant\r\nin the licence of evening recreation, were counterfeiting a miniature chaos.\r\nThe carr\u00e9 was quite dark, except a red light shining under and about the stove;\r\nthe wide glass-doors and the long windows were frosted over; a crystal sparkle\r\nof starlight, here and there spangling this blanched winter veil, and breaking\r\nwith scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery, proved it a clear\r\nnight, though moonless. That I should dare to remain thus alone in darkness,\r\nshowed that my nerves were regaining a healthy tone: I thought of the nun, but\r\nhardly feared her; though the staircase was behind me, leading up, through\r\nblind, black night, from landing to landing, to the haunted grenier. Yet I own\r\nmy heart quaked, my pulse leaped, when I suddenly heard breathing and rustling,\r\nand turning, saw in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper shadow still\u2014a shape\r\nthat moved and descended. It paused a while at the classe-door, and then it\r\nglided before me. Simultaneously came a clangor of the distant door-bell.\r\nLife-like sounds bring life-like feelings: this shape was too round and low for\r\nmy gaunt nun: it was only Madame Beck on duty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle Lucy!\u201d cried Rosine, bursting in, lamp in hand, from the\r\ncorridor, \u201con est l\u00e0 pour vous au salon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame saw me, I saw Madame, Rosine saw us both: there was no mutual\r\nrecognition. I made straight for the salon. There I found what I own I\r\nanticipated I should find\u2014Dr. Bretton; but he was in evening-dress.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe carriage is at the door,\u201d said he; \u201cmy mother has sent it to take you to\r\nthe theatre; she was going herself, but an arrival has prevented her: she\r\nimmediately said, \u2018Take Lucy in my place.\u2019 Will you go?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust now? I am not dressed,\u201d cried I, glancing despairingly at my dark merino.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have half an hour to dress. I should have given you notice, but I only\r\ndetermined on going since five o\u2019clock, when I heard there was to be a genuine\r\nregale in the presence of a great actress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he mentioned a name that thrilled me\u2014a name that, in those days, could\r\nthrill Europe. It is hushed now: its once restless echoes are all still; she\r\nwho bore it went years ago to her rest: night and oblivion long since closed\r\nabove her; but then her day\u2014a day of Sirius\u2014stood at its full height,\r\nlight and fervour.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go; I will be ready in ten minutes,\u201d I vowed. And away I flew, never once\r\nchecked, reader, by the thought which perhaps at this moment checks you:\r\nnamely, that to go anywhere with Graham and without Mrs. Bretton could be\r\nobjectionable. I could not have conceived, much less have expressed to Graham,\r\nsuch thought\u2014such scruple\u2014without risk of exciting a tyrannous self-contempt:\r\nof kindling an inward fire of shame so quenchless, and so devouring, that I\r\nthink it would soon have licked up the very life in my veins. Besides, my\r\ngodmother, knowing her son, and knowing me, would as soon have thought of\r\nchaperoning a sister with a brother, as of keeping anxious guard over our\r\nincomings and outgoings.\r\n\n\r\nThe present was no occasion for showy array; my dun mist crape would suffice,\r\nand I sought the same in the great oak-wardrobe in the dormitory, where hung no\r\nless than forty dresses. But there had been changes and reforms, and some\r\ninnovating hand had pruned this same crowded wardrobe, and carried divers\r\ngarments to the grenier\u2014my crape amongst the rest. I must fetch it. I got the\r\nkey, and went aloft fearless, almost thoughtless. I unlocked the door, I\r\nplunged in. The reader may believe it or not, but when I thus suddenly entered,\r\nthat garret was not wholly dark as it should have been: from one point there\r\nshone a solemn light, like a star, but broader. So plainly it shone, that it\r\nrevealed the deep alcove with a portion of the tarnished scarlet curtain drawn\r\nover it. Instantly, silently, before my eyes, it vanished; so did the curtain\r\nand alcove: all that end of the garret became black as night. I ventured no\r\nresearch; I had not time nor will; snatching my dress, which hung on the wall,\r\nhappily near the door, I rushed out, relocked the door with convulsed haste,\r\nand darted downwards to the dormitory.\r\n\n\r\nBut I trembled too much to dress myself: impossible to arrange hair or fasten\r\nhooks-and-eyes with such fingers, so I called Rosine and bribed her to help me.\r\nRosine liked a bribe, so she did her best, smoothed and plaited my hair as well\r\nas a coiffeur would have done, placed the lace collar mathematically straight,\r\ntied the neck-ribbon accurately\u2014in short, did her work like the neat-handed\r\nPhillis she could be when she chose. Having given me my handkerchief and\r\ngloves, she took the candle and lighted me down-stairs. After all, I had\r\nforgotten my shawl; she ran back to fetch it; and I stood with Dr. John in the\r\nvestibule, waiting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this, Lucy?\u201d said he, looking down at me narrowly. \u201cHere is the old\r\nexcitement. Ha! the nun again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I utterly denied the charge: I was vexed to be suspected of a second\r\nillusion. He was sceptical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has been, as sure as I live,\u201d said he; \u201cher figure crossing your eyes\r\nleaves on them a peculiar gleam and expression not to be mistaken.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has not been,\u201d I persisted: for, indeed, I could deny her\r\napparition with truth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe old symptoms are there,\u201d he affirmed: \u201ca particular pale, and what the\r\nScotch call a \u2018raised\u2019 look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was so obstinate, I thought it better to tell him what I really had\r\nseen. Of course with him it was held to be another effect of the same cause: it\r\nwas all optical illusion\u2014nervous malady, and so on. Not one bit did I believe\r\nhim; but I dared not contradict: doctors are so self-opinionated, so immovable\r\nin their dry, materialist views.\r\n\n\r\nRosine brought the shawl, and I was bundled into the carriage.\r\n\n\r\nThe theatre was full\u2014crammed to its roof: royal and noble were there: palace\r\nand hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed.\r\nDeeply did I feel myself privileged in having a place before that stage; I\r\nlonged to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which made me\r\nconceive peculiar anticipations. I wondered if she would justify her renown:\r\nwith strange curiosity, with feelings severe and austere, yet of riveted\r\ninterest, I waited. She was a study of such nature as had not encountered my\r\neyes yet: a great and new planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her\r\nrising.\r\n\n\r\nShe rose at nine that December night: above the horizon I saw her come. She\r\ncould shine yet with pale grandeur and steady might; but that star verged\r\nalready on its judgment-day. Seen near, it was a chaos\u2014hollow, half-consumed:\r\nan orb perished or perishing\u2014half lava, half glow.\r\n\n\r\nI had heard this woman termed \u201cplain,\u201d and I expected bony harshness and\r\ngrimness\u2014something large, angular, sallow. What I saw was the shadow of a royal\r\nVashti: a queen, fair as the day once, turned pale now like twilight, and\r\nwasted like wax in flame.\r\n\n\r\nFor a while\u2014a long while\u2014I thought it was only a woman, though an unique woman,\r\nwho moved in might and grace before this multitude. By-and-by I recognised my\r\nmistake. Behold! I found upon her something neither of woman nor of man: in\r\neach of her eyes sat a devil. These evil forces bore her through the tragedy,\r\nkept up her feeble strength\u2014for she was but a frail creature; and as the action\r\nrose and the stir deepened, how wildly they shook her with their passions of\r\nthe pit! They wrote HELL on her straight, haughty brow. They\r\ntuned her voice to the note of torment. They writhed her regal face to a\r\ndemoniac mask. Hate and Murder and Madness incarnate she stood.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a marvellous sight: a mighty revelation.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a spectacle low, horrible, immoral.\r\n\n\r\nSwordsmen thrust through, and dying in their blood on the arena sand; bulls\r\ngoring horses disembowelled, made a meeker vision for the public\u2014a milder\r\ncondiment for a people\u2019s palate\u2014than Vashti torn by seven devils: devils which\r\ncried sore and rent the tenement they haunted, but still refused to be\r\nexorcised.\r\n\n\r\nSuffering had struck that stage empress; and she stood before her audience\r\nneither yielding to, nor enduring, nor, in finite measure, resenting it: she\r\nstood locked in struggle, rigid in resistance. She stood, not dressed, but\r\ndraped in pale antique folds, long and regular like sculpture. A background and\r\nentourage and flooring of deepest crimson threw her out, white like\r\nalabaster\u2014like silver: rather, be it said, like Death.\r\n\n\r\nWhere was the artist of the Cleopatra? Let him come and sit down and study this\r\ndifferent vision. Let him seek here the mighty brawn, the muscle, the abounding\r\nblood, the full-fed flesh he worshipped: let all materialists draw nigh and\r\nlook on.\r\n\n\r\nI have said that she does not resent her grief. No; the weakness of that\r\nword would make it a lie. To her, what hurts becomes immediately embodied: she\r\nlooks on it as a thing that can be attacked, worried down, torn in shreds.\r\nScarcely a substance herself, she grapples to conflict with abstractions.\r\nBefore calamity she is a tigress; she rends her woes, shivers them in convulsed\r\nabhorrence. Pain, for her, has no result in good: tears water no harvest of\r\nwisdom: on sickness, on death itself, she looks with the eye of a rebel.\r\nWicked, perhaps, she is, but also she is strong; and her strength has conquered\r\nBeauty, has overcome Grace, and bound both at her side, captives peerlessly\r\nfair, and docile as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad\r\nmovement royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her hair, flying loose in\r\nrevel or war, is still an angel\u2019s hair, and glorious under a halo. Fallen,\r\ninsurgent, banished, she remembers the heaven where she rebelled. Heaven\u2019s\r\nlight, following her exile, pierces its confines, and discloses their forlorn\r\nremoteness.\r\n\n\r\nPlace now the Cleopatra, or any other slug, before her as an obstacle, and see\r\nher cut through the pulpy mass as the scimitar of Saladin clove the down\r\ncushion. Let Paul Peter Rubens wake from the dead, let him rise out of his\r\ncerements, and bring into this presence all the army of his fat women; the\r\nmagian power or prophet-virtue gifting that slight rod of Moses, could, at one\r\nwaft, release and re-mingle a sea spell-parted, whelming the heavy host with\r\nthe down-rush of overthrown sea-ramparts.\r\n\n\r\nVashti was not good, I was told; and I have said she did not look good: though\r\na spirit, she was a spirit out of Tophet. Well, if so much of unholy force can\r\narise from below, may not an equal efflux of sacred essence descend one day\r\nfrom above?\r\n\n\r\nWhat thought Dr. Graham of this being?\r\n\n\r\nFor long intervals I forgot to look how he demeaned himself, or to question\r\nwhat he thought. The strong magnetism of genius drew my heart out of its wonted\r\norbit; the sunflower turned from the south to a fierce light, not solar\u2014a\r\nrushing, red, cometary light\u2014hot on vision and to sensation. I had seen acting\r\nbefore, but never anything like this: never anything which astonished Hope and\r\nhushed Desire; which outstripped Impulse and paled Conception; which, instead\r\nof merely irritating imagination with the thought of what might be done,\r\nat the same time fevering the nerves because it was not done, disclosed\r\npower like a deep, swollen winter river, thundering in cataract, and bearing\r\nthe soul, like a leaf, on the steep and steelly sweep of its descent.\r\n\n\r\nMiss Fanshawe, with her usual ripeness of judgment, pronounced Dr. Bretton a\r\nserious, impassioned man, too grave and too impressible. Not in such light did\r\nI ever see him: no such faults could I lay to his charge. His natural attitude\r\nwas not the meditative, nor his natural mood the sentimental;\r\nimpressionable he was as dimpling water, but, almost as water,\r\nunimpressible: the breeze, the sun, moved him\u2014metal could not grave, nor\r\nfire brand.\r\n\n\r\nDr. John could think and think well, but he was rather a man of action\r\nthan of thought; he could feel, and feel vividly in his way, but his\r\nheart had no chord for enthusiasm: to bright, soft, sweet influences his eyes\r\nand lips gave bright, soft, sweet welcome, beautiful to see as dyes of rose and\r\nsilver, pearl and purple, imbuing summer clouds; for what belonged to storm,\r\nwhat was wild and intense, dangerous, sudden, and flaming, he had no sympathy,\r\nand held with it no communion. When I took time and regained inclination to\r\nglance at him, it amused and enlightened me to discover that he was watching\r\nthat sinister and sovereign Vashti, not with wonder, nor worship, nor yet\r\ndismay, but simply with intense curiosity. Her agony did not pain him, her wild\r\nmoan\u2014worse than a shriek\u2014did not much move him; her fury revolted him somewhat,\r\nbut not to the point of horror. Cool young Briton! The pale cliffs of his own\r\nEngland do not look down on the tides of the Channel more calmly than he\r\nwatched the Pythian inspiration of that night.\r\n\n\r\nLooking at his face, I longed to know his exact opinions, and at last I put a\r\nquestion tending to elicit them. At the sound of my voice he awoke as if out of\r\na dream; for he had been thinking, and very intently thinking, his own\r\nthoughts, after his own manner. \u201cHow did he like Vashti?\u201d I wished to know.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHm-m-m,\u201d was the first scarce articulate but expressive answer; and then such\r\na strange smile went wandering round his lips, a smile so critical, so almost\r\ncallous! I suppose that for natures of that order his sympathies were\r\ncallous. In a few terse phrases he told me his opinion of, and feeling towards,\r\nthe actress: he judged her as a woman, not an artist: it was a branding\r\njudgment.\r\n\n\r\nThat night was already marked in my book of life, not with white, but with a\r\ndeep-red cross. But I had not done with it yet; and other memoranda were\r\ndestined to be set down in characters of tint indelible.\r\n\n\r\nTowards midnight, when the deepening tragedy blackened to the death-scene, and\r\nall held their breath, and even Graham bit his under-lip, and knit his brow,\r\nand sat still and struck\u2014when the whole theatre was hushed, when the vision of\r\nall eyes centred in one point, when all ears listened towards one\r\nquarter\u2014nothing being seen but the white form sunk on a seat, quivering in\r\nconflict with her last, her worst-hated, her visibly-conquering foe\u2014nothing\r\nheard but her throes, her gaspings, breathing yet of mutiny, panting still\r\ndefiance; when, as it seemed, an inordinate will, convulsing a perishing mortal\r\nframe, bent it to battle with doom and death, fought every inch of ground, sold\r\nevery drop of blood, resisted to the latest the rape of every faculty,\r\nwould see, would hear, would breathe, would live,\r\nup to, within, well-nigh beyond the moment when death says to all sense\r\nand all being\u2014\u201cThus far and no farther!\u201d\u2014\r\n\n\r\nJust then a stir, pregnant with omen, rustled behind the scenes\u2014feet ran,\r\nvoices spoke. What was it? demanded the whole house. A flame, a smell of smoke\r\nreplied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d rang through the gallery. \u201cFire!\u201d was repeated, re-echoed, yelled\r\nforth: and then, and faster than pen can set it down, came panic, rushing,\r\ncrushing\u2014a blind, selfish, cruel chaos.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Dr. John? Reader, I see him yet, with his look of comely courage and\r\ncordial calm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy will sit still, I know,\u201d said he, glancing down at me with the same\r\nserene goodness, the same repose of firmness that I have seen in him when\r\nsitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mother\u2019s hearth. Yes, thus\r\nadjured, I think I would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to\r\nsit still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and at the price of my very\r\nlife, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart his will, or make\r\ndemands on his attention. We were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there\r\nwas a most terrible, ruthless pressure about us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow terrified are the women!\u201d said he; \u201cbut if the men were not almost equally\r\nso, order might be maintained. This is a sorry scene: I see fifty selfish\r\nbrutes at this moment, each of whom, if I were near, I could conscientiously\r\nknock down. I see some women braver than some men. There is one yonder\u2014Good\r\nGod!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile Graham was speaking, a young girl who had been very quietly and steadily\r\nclinging to a gentleman before us, was suddenly struck from her protector\u2019s\r\narms by a big, butcherly intruder, and hurled under the feet of the crowd.\r\nScarce two seconds lasted her disappearance. Graham rushed forwards; he and the\r\ngentleman, a powerful man though grey-haired, united their strength to thrust\r\nback the throng; her head and long hair fell back over his shoulder: she seemed\r\nunconscious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrust her with me; I am a medical man,\u201d said Dr. John.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf you have no lady with you, be it so,\u201d was the answer. \u201cHold her, and I will\r\nforce a passage: we must get her to the air.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a lady,\u201d said Graham; \u201cbut she will be neither hindrance nor\r\nincumbrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe summoned me with his eye: we were separated. Resolute, however, to rejoin\r\nhim, I penetrated the living barrier, creeping under where I could not get\r\nbetween or over.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFasten on me, and don\u2019t leave go,\u201d he said; and I obeyed him.\r\n\n\r\nOur pioneer proved strong and adroit; he opened the dense mass like a wedge;\r\nwith patience and toil he at last bored through the flesh-and-blood rock\u2014so\r\nsolid, hot, and suffocating\u2014and brought us to the fresh, freezing night.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are an Englishman!\u201d said he, turning shortly on Dr. Bretton, when we got\r\ninto the street.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn Englishman. And I speak to a countryman?\u201d was the reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight. Be good enough to stand here two minutes, whilst I find my carriage.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I am not hurt,\u201d said a girlish voice; \u201cam I with papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are with a friend, and your father is close at hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell him I am not hurt, except just in my shoulder. Oh, my shoulder! They trod\r\njust here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDislocation, perhaps!\u201d muttered the Doctor: \u201clet us hope there is no worse\r\ninjury done. Lucy, lend a hand one instant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I assisted while he made some arrangement of drapery and position for the\r\nease of his suffering burden. She suppressed a moan, and lay in his arms\r\nquietly and patiently.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is very light,\u201d said Graham, \u201clike a child!\u201d and he asked in my ear, \u201cIs\r\nshe a child, Lucy? Did you notice her age?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not a child\u2014I am a person of seventeen,\u201d responded the patient, demurely\r\nand with dignity. Then, directly after: \u201cTell papa to come; I get anxious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe carriage drove up; her father relieved Graham; but in the exchange from one\r\nbearer to another she was hurt, and moaned again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy darling!\u201d said the father, tenderly; then turning to Graham, \u201cYou said,\r\nsir, you are a medical man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am: Dr. Bretton, of La Terrasse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood. Will you step into my carriage?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy own carriage is here: I will seek it, and accompany you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe pleased, then, to follow us.\u201d And he named his address: \u201cThe H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy,\r\nin the Rue Cr\u00e9cy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe followed; the carriage drove fast; myself and Graham were silent. This\r\nseemed like an adventure.\r\n\n\r\nSome little time being lost in seeking our own equipage, we reached the hotel\r\nperhaps about ten minutes after these strangers. It was an hotel in the foreign\r\nsense: a collection of dwelling-houses, not an inn\u2014a vast, lofty pile, with a\r\nhuge arch to its street-door, leading through a vaulted covered way, into a\r\nsquare all built round.\r\n\n\r\nWe alighted, passed up a wide, handsome public staircase, and stopped at Num\u00e9ro\r\n2 on the second landing; the first floor comprising the abode of I know not\r\nwhat \u201cprince Russe,\u201d as Graham informed me. On ringing the bell at a second\r\ngreat door, we were admitted to a suite of very handsome apartments. Announced\r\nby a servant in livery, we entered a drawing-room whose hearth glowed with an\r\nEnglish fire, and whose walls gleamed with foreign mirrors. Near the hearth\r\nappeared a little group: a slight form sunk in a deep arm-chair, one or two\r\nwomen busy about it, the iron-grey gentleman anxiously looking on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Harriet? I wish Harriet would come to me,\u201d said the girlish voice,\r\nfaintly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Mrs. Hurst?\u201d demanded the gentleman impatiently and somewhat sternly\r\nof the man-servant who had admitted us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to say she is gone out of town, sir; my young lady gave her leave\r\ntill to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014I did\u2014I did. She is gone to see her sister; I said she might go: I\r\nremember now,\u201d interposed the young lady; \u201cbut I am so sorry, for Manon and\r\nLouison cannot understand a word I say, and they hurt me without meaning to do\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDr. John and the gentleman now interchanged greetings; and while they passed a\r\nfew minutes in consultation, I approached the easy-chair, and seeing what the\r\nfaint and sinking girl wished to have done, I did it for her.\r\n\n\r\nI was still occupied in the arrangement, when Graham drew near; he was no less\r\nskilled in surgery than medicine, and, on examination, found that no further\r\nadvice than his own was necessary to the treatment of the present case. He\r\nordered her to be carried to her chamber, and whispered to me:\u2014\u201cGo with the\r\nwomen, Lucy; they seem but dull; you can at least direct their movements, and\r\nthus spare her some pain. She must be touched very tenderly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe chamber was a room shadowy with pale-blue hangings, vaporous with\r\ncurtainings and veilings of muslin; the bed seemed to me like snow-drift and\r\nmist\u2014spotless, soft, and gauzy. Making the women stand apart, I undressed their\r\nmistress, without their well-meaning but clumsy aid. I was not in a\r\nsufficiently collected mood to note with separate distinctness every detail of\r\nthe attire I removed, but I received a general impression of refinement,\r\ndelicacy, and perfect personal cultivation; which, in a period of\r\nafter-thought, offered in my reflections a singular contrast to notes retained\r\nof Miss Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s appointments.\r\n\n\r\nThe girl was herself a small, delicate creature, but made like a model. As I\r\nfolded back her plentiful yet fine hair, so shining and soft, and so\r\nexquisitely tended, I had under my observation a young, pale, weary, but\r\nhigh-bred face. The brow was smooth and clear; the eyebrows were distinct, but\r\nsoft, and melting to a mere trace at the temples; the eyes were a rich gift of\r\nnature\u2014fine and full, large, deep, seeming to hold dominion over the slighter\r\nsubordinate features\u2014capable, probably, of much significance at another hour\r\nand under other circumstances than the present, but now languid and suffering.\r\nHer skin was perfectly fair, the neck and hands veined finely like the petals\r\nof a flower; a thin glazing of the ice of pride polished this delicate\r\nexterior, and her lip wore a curl\u2014I doubt not inherent and unconscious, but\r\nwhich, if I had seen it first with the accompaniments of health and state,\r\nwould have struck me as unwarranted, and proving in the little lady a quite\r\nmistaken view of life and her own consequence.\r\n\n\r\nHer demeanour under the Doctor\u2019s hands at first excited a smile; it was not\r\npuerile\u2014rather, on the whole, patient and firm\u2014but yet, once or twice she\r\naddressed him with suddenness and sharpness, saying that he hurt her, and must\r\ncontrive to give her less pain; I saw her large eyes, too, settle on his face\r\nlike the solemn eyes of some pretty, wondering child. I know not whether Graham\r\nfelt this examination: if he did, he was cautious not to check or discomfort it\r\nby any retaliatory look. I think he performed his work with extreme care and\r\ngentleness, sparing her what pain he could; and she acknowledged as much, when\r\nhe had done, by the words:\u2014\u201cThank you, Doctor, and good-night,\u201d very gratefully\r\npronounced as she uttered them, however, it was with a repetition of the\r\nserious, direct gaze, I thought, peculiar in its gravity and intentness.\r\n\n\r\nThe injuries, it seems, were not dangerous: an assurance which her father\r\nreceived with a smile that almost made one his friend\u2014it was so glad and\r\ngratified. He now expressed his obligations to Graham with as much earnestness\r\nas was befitting an Englishman addressing one who has served him, but is yet a\r\nstranger; he also begged him to call the next day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa,\u201d said a voice from the veiled couch, \u201cthank the lady, too; is she\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI opened the curtain with a smile, and looked in at her. She lay now at\r\ncomparative ease; she looked pretty, though pale; her face was delicately\r\ndesigned, and if at first sight it appeared proud, I believe custom might prove\r\nit to be soft.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thank the lady very sincerely,\u201d said her father: \u201cI fancy she has been very\r\ngood to my child. I think we scarcely dare tell Mrs. Hurst who has been her\r\nsubstitute and done her work; she will feel at once ashamed and jealous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, in the most friendly spirit, parting greetings were interchanged; and\r\nrefreshment having been hospitably offered, but by us, as it was late, refused,\r\nwe withdrew from the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy.\r\n\n\r\nOn our way back we repassed the theatre. All was silence and darkness: the\r\nroaring, rushing crowd all vanished and gone\u2014the damps, as well as the\r\nincipient fire, extinct and forgotten. Next morning\u2019s papers explained that it\r\nwas but some loose drapery on which a spark had fallen, and which had blazed up\r\nand been quenched in a moment.\r\n\n"}
{"25": "\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nM. DE BASSOMPIERRE.\n\r\nThose who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of\r\nschools or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly\r\nand for a long while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens\r\nof a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of\r\nunusually frequent intercourse\u2014some congeries of rather exciting little\r\ncircumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem to be the quickening than\r\nthe suspension of communication\u2014there falls a stilly pause, a wordless silence,\r\na long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire and\r\nunexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit,\r\nformerly periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other token that\r\nindicated remembrance, comes no more.\r\n\n\r\nAlways there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but knew\r\nthem. Though he is stagnant in his cell, his connections without are whirling\r\nin the very vortex of life. That void interval which passes for him so slowly\r\nthat the very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours plod by in the\r\nlikeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestones\u2014that same interval,\r\nperhaps, teems with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.\r\n\n\r\nThe hermit\u2014if he be a sensible hermit\u2014will swallow his own thoughts, and lock\r\nup his own emotions during these weeks of inward winter. He will know that\r\nDestiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the dormouse, and he will be\r\nconformable: make a tidy ball of himself, creep into a hole of life\u2019s wall, and\r\nsubmit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving\r\nhim in ice for the season.\r\n\n\r\nLet him say, \u201cIt is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.\u201d And,\r\nperhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will open, spring\u2019s softness will return,\r\nthe sun and south-wind will reach him; the budding of hedges, and carolling of\r\nbirds, and singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.\r\nPerhaps this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get into his\r\nheart and never thaw more; when spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of\r\nthe wall only his dormouse-bones. Well, even in that case, all will be right:\r\nit is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal, and must one day go\r\nthe way of all flesh, \u201cAs well soon as syne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFollowing that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks as bare\r\nas seven sheets of blank paper: no word was written on one of them; not a\r\nvisit, not a token.\r\n\n\r\nAbout the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had happened\r\nto my friends at La Terrasse. The mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the\r\nsolitary: his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy; the doubts\r\nhitherto repelled gather now to a mass and\u2014strong in accumulation\u2014roll back\r\nupon him with a force which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an\r\nunkindly time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree: strange starts and\r\nstruggles harass his couch: the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of\r\ncalamity, and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league\r\nagainst him. Poor wretch! He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor,\r\npallid, wasting wretch, despite that best.\r\n\n\r\nTowards the last of these long seven weeks I admitted, what through the other\r\nsix I had jealously excluded\u2014the conviction that these blanks were inevitable:\r\nthe result of circumstances, the fiat of fate, a part of my life\u2019s lot\r\nand\u2014above all\u2014a matter about whose origin no question must ever be asked, for\r\nwhose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered. Of course I did not blame myself\r\nfor suffering: I thank God I had a truer sense of justice than to fall into any\r\nimbecile extravagance of self-accusation; and as to blaming others for silence,\r\nin my reason I well knew them blameless, and in my heart acknowledged them so:\r\nbut it was a rough and heavy road to travel, and I longed for better days.\r\n\n\r\nI tried different expedients to sustain and fill existence: I commenced an\r\nelaborate piece of lace-work, I studied German pretty hard, I undertook a\r\ncourse of regular reading of the driest and thickest books in the library; in\r\nall my efforts I was as orthodox as I knew how to be. Was there error\r\nsomewhere? Very likely. I only know the result was as if I had gnawed a file to\r\nsatisfy hunger, or drank brine to quench thirst.\r\n\n\r\nMy hour of torment was the post-hour. Unfortunately, I knew it too well, and\r\ntried as vainly as assiduously to cheat myself of that knowledge; dreading the\r\nrack of expectation, and the sick collapse of disappointment which daily\r\npreceded and followed upon that well-recognised ring.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose animals kept in cages, and so scantily fed as to be always upon the\r\nverge of famine, await their food as I awaited a letter. Oh!\u2014to speak truth,\r\nand drop that tone of a false calm which long to sustain, outwears nature\u2019s\r\nendurance\u2014I underwent in those seven weeks bitter fears and pains, strange\r\ninward trials, miserable defections of hope, intolerable encroachments of\r\ndespair. This last came so near me sometimes that her breath went right through\r\nme. I used to feel it like a baleful air or sigh, penetrate deep, and make\r\nmotion pause at my heart, or proceed only under unspeakable oppression. The\r\nletter\u2014the well-beloved letter\u2014would not come; and it was all of sweetness in\r\nlife I had to look for.\r\n\n\r\nIn the very extremity of want, I had recourse again, and yet again, to the\r\nlittle packet in the case\u2014the five letters. How splendid that month seemed\r\nwhose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars! It was always at night I\r\nvisited them, and not daring to ask every evening for a candle in the kitchen,\r\nI bought a wax taper and matches to light it, and at the study-hour stole up to\r\nthe dormitory and feasted on my crust from the Barmecide\u2019s loaf. It did not\r\nnourish me: I pined on it, and got as thin as a shadow: otherwise I was not\r\nill.\r\n\n\r\nReading there somewhat late one evening, and feeling that the power to read was\r\nleaving me\u2014for the letters from incessant perusal were losing all sap and\r\nsignificance: my gold was withering to leaves before my eyes, and I was\r\nsorrowing over the disillusion\u2014suddenly a quick tripping foot ran up the\r\nstairs. I knew Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s step: she had dined in town that afternoon;\r\nshe was now returned, and would come here to replace her shawl, &c. in the\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\n\r\nYes: in she came, dressed in bright silk, with her shawl falling from her\r\nshoulders, and her curls, half-uncurled in the damp of night, drooping careless\r\nand heavy upon her neck. I had hardly time to recasket my treasures and lock\r\nthem up when she was at my side her humour seemed none of the best.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a stupid evening: they are stupid people,\u201d she began.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho? Mrs. Cholmondeley? I thought you always found her house charming?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not been to Mrs. Cholmondeley\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Have you made new acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle de Bassompierre is come.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour uncle de Bassompierre! Are you not glad?\u2014I thought he was a favourite.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought wrong: the man is odious; I hate him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is a foreigner? or for what other reason of equal weight?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is not a foreigner. The man is English enough, goodness knows; and had an\r\nEnglish name till three or four years ago; but his mother was a foreigner, a de\r\nBassompierre, and some of her family are dead and have left him estates, a\r\ntitle, and this name: he is quite a great man now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you hate him for that reason?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know what mamma says about him? He is not my own uncle, but married\r\nmamma\u2019s sister. Mamma detests him; she says he killed aunt Ginevra with\r\nunkindness: he looks like a bear. Such a dismal evening!\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019ll go\r\nno more to his big hotel. Fancy me walking into a room alone, and a great man\r\nfifty years old coming forwards, and after a few minutes\u2019 conversation actually\r\nturning his back upon me, and then abruptly going out of the room. Such odd\r\nways! I daresay his conscience smote him, for they all say at home I am the\r\npicture of aunt Ginevra. Mamma often declares the likeness is quite\r\nridiculous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere you the only visitor?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe only visitor? Yes; then there was missy, my cousin: little spoiled,\r\npampered thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. de Bassompierre has a daughter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes: don\u2019t tease one with questions. Oh, dear! I am so tired.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe yawned. Throwing herself without ceremony on my bed she added, \u201cIt seems\r\nMademoiselle was nearly crushed to a jelly in a hubbub at the theatre some\r\nweeks ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! indeed. And they live at a large hotel in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustement. How do you know?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have been there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you have? Really! You go everywhere in these days. I suppose Mother\r\nBretton took you. She and Esculapius have the entr\u00e9e of the de\r\nBassompierre apartments: it seems \u2018my son John\u2019 attended missy on the occasion\r\nof her accident\u2014Accident? Bah! All affectation! I don\u2019t think she was squeezed\r\nmore than she richly deserves for her airs. And now there is quite an intimacy\r\nstruck up: I heard something about \u2018auld lang syne,\u2019 and what not. Oh, how\r\nstupid they all were!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll! You said you were the only visitor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I? You see one forgets to particularize an old woman and her boy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. and Mrs. Bretton were at M. de Bassompierre\u2019s this evening?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay! as large as life; and missy played the hostess. What a conceited doll\r\nit is!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoured and listless, Miss Fanshawe was beginning to disclose the causes of her\r\nprostrate condition. There had been a retrenchment of incense, a diversion or a\r\ntotal withholding of homage and attention coquetry had failed of effect, vanity\r\nhad undergone mortification. She lay fuming in the vapours.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Miss de Bassompierre quite well now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs well as you or I, no doubt; but she is an affected little thing, and gave\r\nherself invalid airs to attract medical notice. And to see the old dowager\r\nmaking her recline on a couch, and \u2018my son John\u2019 prohibiting excitement,\r\netcetera\u2014faugh! the scene was quite sickening.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt would not have been so if the object of attention had been changed: if you\r\nhad taken Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s place.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! I hate \u2018my son John!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My son John!\u2019\u2014whom do you indicate by that name? Dr. Bretton\u2019s mother never\r\ncalls him so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen she ought. A clownish, bearish John he is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou violate the truth in saying so; and as the whole of my patience is now\r\nspun off the distaff, I peremptorily desire you to rise from that bed, and\r\nvacate this room.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPassionate thing! Your face is the colour of a coquelicot. I wonder what\r\nalways makes you so mighty testy \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du gros Jean? \u2018John Anderson, my\r\nJoe, John!\u2019 Oh, the distinguished name!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThrilling with exasperation, to which it would have been sheer folly to have\r\ngiven vent\u2014for there was no contending with that unsubstantial feather, that\r\nmealy-winged moth\u2014I extinguished my taper, locked my bureau, and left her,\r\nsince she would not leave me. Small-beer as she was, she had turned\r\ninsufferably acid.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow was Thursday and a half-holiday. Breakfast was over; I had withdrawn\r\nto the first classe. The dreaded hour, the post-hour, was nearing, and I sat\r\nwaiting it, much as a ghost-seer might wait his spectre. Less than ever was a\r\nletter probable; still, strive as I would, I could not forget that it was\r\npossible. As the moments lessened, a restlessness and fear almost beyond the\r\naverage assailed me. It was a day of winter east wind, and I had now for some\r\ntime entered into that dreary fellowship with the winds and their changes, so\r\nlittle known, so incomprehensible to the healthy. The north and east owned a\r\nterrific influence, making all pain more poignant, all sorrow sadder. The south\r\ncould calm, the west sometimes cheer: unless, indeed, they brought on their\r\nwings the burden of thunder-clouds, under the weight and warmth of which all\r\nenergy died.\r\n\n\r\nBitter and dark as was this January day, I remember leaving the classe, and\r\nrunning down without bonnet to the bottom of the long garden, and then\r\nlingering amongst the stripped shrubs, in the forlorn hope that the postman\u2019s\r\nring might occur while I was out of hearing, and I might thus be spared the\r\nthrill which some particular nerve or nerves, almost gnawed through with the\r\nunremitting tooth of a fixed idea, were becoming wholly unfit to support. I\r\nlingered as long as I dared without fear of attracting attention by my absence.\r\nI muffled my head in my apron, and stopped my ears in terror of the torturing\r\nclang, sure to be followed by such blank silence, such barren vacuum for me. At\r\nlast I ventured to re-enter the first classe, where, as it was not yet nine\r\no\u2019clock, no pupils had been admitted. The first thing seen was a white object\r\non my black desk, a white, flat object. The post had, indeed, arrived; by me\r\nunheard. Rosine had visited my cell, and, like some angel, had left behind her\r\na bright token of her presence. That shining thing on the desk was indeed a\r\nletter, a real letter; I saw so much at the distance of three yards, and as I\r\nhad but one correspondent on earth, from that one it must come. He remembered\r\nme yet. How deep a pulse of gratitude sent new life through my heart.\r\n\n\r\nDrawing near, bending and looking on the letter, in trembling but almost\r\ncertain hope of seeing a known hand, it was my lot to find, on the contrary, an\r\nautograph for the moment deemed unknown\u2014a pale female scrawl, instead of a\r\nfirm, masculine character. I then thought fate was too hard for me, and\r\nI said, audibly, \u201cThis is cruel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I got over that pain also. Life is still life, whatever its pangs: our eyes\r\nand ears and their use remain with us, though the prospect of what pleases be\r\nwholly withdrawn, and the sound of what consoles be quite silenced.\r\n\n\r\nI opened the billet: by this time I had recognised its handwriting as perfectly\r\nfamiliar. It was dated \u201cLa Terrasse,\u201d and it ran thus:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDEAR LUCY,\u2014It occurs to me to inquire what you have been doing with yourself\r\nfor the last month or two? Not that I suspect you would have the least\r\ndifficulty in giving an account of your proceedings. I daresay you have been\r\njust as busy and as happy as ourselves at La Terrasse. As to Graham, his\r\nprofessional connection extends daily: he is so much sought after, so much\r\nengaged, that I tell him he will grow quite conceited. Like a right good\r\nmother, as I am, I do my best to keep him down: no flattery does he get from\r\nme, as you know. And yet, Lucy, he is a fine fellow: his mother\u2019s heart dances\r\nat the sight of him. After being hurried here and there the whole day, and\r\npassing the ordeal of fifty sorts of tempers, and combating a hundred caprices,\r\nand sometimes witnessing cruel sufferings\u2014perhaps, occasionally, as I tell him,\r\ninflicting them\u2014at night he still comes home to me in such kindly, pleasant\r\nmood, that really, I seem to live in a sort of moral antipodes, and on these\r\nJanuary evenings my day rises when other people\u2019s night sets in.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStill he needs keeping in order, and correcting, and repressing, and I do\r\nhim that good service; but the boy is so elastic there is no such thing as\r\nvexing him thoroughly. When I think I have at last driven him to the sullens,\r\nhe turns on me with jokes for retaliation: but you know him and all his\r\niniquities, and I am but an elderly simpleton to make him the subject of this\r\nepistle.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs for me, I have had my old Bretton agent here on a visit, and have been\r\nplunged overhead and ears in business matters. I do so wish to regain for\r\nGraham at least some part of what his father left him. He laughs to scorn my\r\nanxiety on this point, bidding me look and see how he can provide for himself\r\nand me too, and asking what the old lady can possibly want that she has not;\r\nhinting about sky-blue turbans; accusing me of an ambition to wear diamonds,\r\nkeep livery servants, have an hotel, and lead the fashion amongst the English\r\nclan in Villette.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTalking of sky-blue turbans, I wish you had been with us the other\r\nevening. He had come in really tired, and after I had given him his tea, he\r\nthrew himself into my chair with his customary presumption. To my great\r\ndelight, he dropped asleep. (You know how he teases me about being drowsy; I,\r\nwho never, by any chance, close an eye by daylight.) While he slept, I thought\r\nhe looked very bonny, Lucy: fool as I am to be so proud of him; but who can\r\nhelp it? Show me his peer. Look where I will, I see nothing like him in\r\nVillette. Well, I took it into my head to play him a trick: so I brought out\r\nthe sky-blue turban, and handling it with gingerly precaution, I managed to\r\ninvest his brows with this grand adornment. I assure you it did not at all\r\nmisbecome him; he looked quite Eastern, except that he is so fair. Nobody,\r\nhowever, can accuse him of having red hair now\u2014it is genuine chestnut\u2014a\r\ndark, glossy chestnut; and when I put my large cashmere about him, there was as\r\nfine a young bey, dey, or pacha improvised as you would wish to see.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt was good entertainment; but only half-enjoyed, since I was alone: you\r\nshould have been there.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn due time my lord awoke: the looking-glass above the fireplace soon\r\nintimated to him his plight: as you may imagine, I now live under threat and\r\ndread of vengeance.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut to come to the gist of my letter. I know Thursday is a half-holiday in\r\nthe Rue Fossette: be ready, then, by five in the afternoon, at which hour I\r\nwill send the carriage to take you out to La Terrasse. Be sure to come: you may\r\nmeet some old acquaintance. Good-by, my wise, dear, grave little\r\ngod-daughter.\u2014Very truly yours,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLOUISA BRETTON.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, a letter like that sets one to rights! I might still be sad after reading\r\nthat letter, but I was more composed; not exactly cheered, perhaps, but\r\nrelieved. My friends, at least, were well and happy: no accident had occurred\r\nto Graham; no illness had seized his mother\u2014calamities that had so long been my\r\ndream and thought. Their feelings for me too were\u2014as they had been. Yet, how\r\nstrange it was to look on Mrs. Bretton\u2019s seven weeks and contrast them with my\r\nseven weeks! Also, how very wise it is in people placed in an exceptional\r\nposition to hold their tongues and not rashly declare how such position galls\r\nthem! The world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want of\r\nfood: perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of going mad from\r\nsolitary confinement. They see the long-buried prisoner disinterred, a maniac\r\nor an idiot!\u2014how his senses left him\u2014how his nerves, first inflamed, underwent\r\nnameless agony, and then sunk to palsy\u2014is a subject too intricate for\r\nexamination, too abstract for popular comprehension. Speak of it! you might\r\nalmost as well stand up in an European market-place, and propound dark sayings\r\nin that language and mood wherein Nebuchadnezzar, the imperial hypochondriac,\r\ncommuned with his baffled Chaldeans. And long, long may the minds to whom such\r\nthemes are no mystery\u2014by whom their bearings are sympathetically seized\u2014be few\r\nin number, and rare of rencounter. Long may it be generally thought that\r\nphysical privations alone merit compassion, and that the rest is a figment.\r\nWhen the world was younger and haler than now, moral trials were a deeper\r\nmystery still: perhaps in all the land of Israel there was but one\r\nSaul\u2014certainly but one David to soothe or comprehend him.\r\n\n\r\nThe keen, still cold of the morning was succeeded, later in the day, by a sharp\r\nbreathing from Russian wastes: the cold zone sighed over the temperate zone,\r\nand froze it fast. A heavy firmament, dull, and thick with snow, sailed up from\r\nthe north, and settled over expectant Europe. Towards afternoon began the\r\ndescent. I feared no carriage would come, the white tempest raged so dense and\r\nwild. But trust my godmother! Once having asked, she would have her guest.\r\nAbout six o\u2019clock I was lifted from the carriage over the already blocked-up\r\nfront steps of the ch\u00e2teau, and put in at the door of La Terrasse.\r\n\n\r\nRunning through the vestibule, and up-stairs to the drawing-room, there I found\r\nMrs. Bretton\u2014a summer-day in her own person. Had I been twice as cold as I was,\r\nher kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me. Inured now for so long a\r\ntime to rooms with bare boards, black benches, desks, and stoves, the blue\r\nsaloon seemed to me gorgeous. In its Christmas-like fire alone there was a\r\nclear and crimson splendour which quite dazzled me.\r\n\n\r\nWhen my godmother had held my hand for a little while, and chatted with me, and\r\nscolded me for having become thinner than when she last saw me, she professed\r\nto discover that the snow-wind had disordered my hair, and sent me up-stairs to\r\nmake it neat and remove my shawl.\r\n\n\r\nRepairing to my own little sea-green room, there also I found a bright fire,\r\nand candles too were lit: a tall waxlight stood on each side the great\r\nlooking-glass; but between the candles, and before the glass, appeared\r\nsomething dressing itself\u2014an airy, fairy thing\u2014small, slight, white\u2014a winter\r\nspirit.\r\n\n\r\nI declare, for one moment I thought of Graham and his spectral illusions. With\r\ndistrustful eye I noted the details of this new vision. It wore white,\r\nsprinkled slightly with drops of scarlet; its girdle was red; it had something\r\nin its hair leafy, yet shining\u2014a little wreath with an evergreen gloss.\r\nSpectral or not, here truly was nothing frightful, and I advanced.\r\n\n\r\nTurning quick upon me, a large eye, under long lashes, flashed over me, the\r\nintruder: the lashes were as dark as long, and they softened with their\r\npencilling the orb they guarded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you are come!\u201d she breathed out, in a soft, quiet voice, and she smiled\r\nslowly, and gazed intently.\r\n\n\r\nI knew her now. Having only once seen that sort of face, with that cast of fine\r\nand delicate featuring, I could not but know her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss de Bassompierre,\u201d I pronounced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d was the reply, \u201cnot Miss de Bassompierre for you!\u201d I did not\r\ninquire who then she might be, but waited voluntary information.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are changed, but still you are yourself,\u201d she said, approaching nearer. \u201cI\r\nremember you well\u2014your countenance, the colour of your hair, the outline of\r\nyour face\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had moved to the fire, and she stood opposite, and gazed into me; and as she\r\ngazed, her face became gradually more and more expressive of thought and\r\nfeeling, till at last a dimness quenched her clear vision.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt makes me almost cry to look so far back,\u201d said she: \u201cbut as to being sorry,\r\nor sentimental, don\u2019t think it: on the contrary, I am quite pleased and glad.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInterested, yet altogether at fault, I knew not what to say. At last I\r\nstammered, \u201cI think I never met you till that night, some weeks ago, when you\r\nwere hurt\u2026?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe smiled. \u201cYou have forgotten then that I have sat on your knee, been lifted\r\nin your arms, even shared your pillow? You no longer remember the night when I\r\ncame crying, like a naughty little child as I was, to your bedside, and you\r\ntook me in. You have no memory for the comfort and protection by which you\r\nsoothed an acute distress? Go back to Bretton. Remember Mr. Home.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt last I saw it all. \u201cAnd you are little Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow time can change! Little Polly wore in her pale, small features, her fairy\r\nsymmetry, her varying expression, a certain promise of interest and grace; but\r\nPaulina Mary was become beautiful\u2014not with the beauty that strikes the eye like\r\na rose\u2014orbed, ruddy, and replete; not with the plump, and pink, and flaxen\r\nattributes of her blond cousin Ginevra; but her seventeen years had brought her\r\na refined and tender charm which did not lie in complexion, though hers was\r\nfair and clear; nor in outline, though her features were sweet, and her limbs\r\nperfectly turned; but, I think, rather in a subdued glow from the soul outward.\r\nThis was not an opaque vase, of material however costly, but a lamp chastely\r\nlucent, guarding from extinction, yet not hiding from worship, a flame vital\r\nand vestal. In speaking of her attractions, I would not exaggerate language;\r\nbut, indeed, they seemed to me very real and engaging. What though all was on a\r\nsmall scale, it was the perfume which gave this white violet distinction, and\r\nmade it superior to the broadest camelia\u2014the fullest dahlia that ever bloomed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! and you remember the old time at Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d said she, \u201cbetter, perhaps, than you. I remember it with minute\r\ndistinctness: not only the time, but the days of the time, and the hours of the\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must have forgotten some things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery little, I imagine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou were then a little creature of quick feelings: you must, long ere this,\r\nhave outgrown the impressions with which joy and grief, affection and\r\nbereavement, stamped your mind ten years ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think I have forgotten whom I liked, and in what degree I liked them when\r\na child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sharpness must be gone\u2014the point, the poignancy\u2014the deep imprint must be\r\nsoftened away and effaced?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have a good memory for those days.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked as if she had. Her eyes were the eyes of one who can remember; one\r\nwhose childhood does not fade like a dream, nor whose youth vanish like a\r\nsunbeam. She would not take life, loosely and incoherently, in parts, and let\r\none season slip as she entered on another: she would retain and add; often\r\nreview from the commencement, and so grow in harmony and consistency as she\r\ngrew in years. Still I could not quite admit the conviction that all the\r\npictures which now crowded upon me were vivid and visible to her. Her fond\r\nattachments, her sports and contests with a well-loved playmate, the patient,\r\ntrue devotion of her child\u2019s heart, her fears, her delicate reserves, her\r\nlittle trials, the last piercing pain of separation\u2026. I retraced these things,\r\nand shook my head incredulous. She persisted. \u201cThe child of seven years lives\r\nyet in the girl of seventeen,\u201d said she.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou used to be excessively fond of Mrs. Bretton,\u201d I remarked, intending to\r\ntest her. She set me right at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot excessively fond,\u201d said she; \u201cI liked her: I respected her as I\r\nshould do now: she seems to me very little altered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is not much changed,\u201d I assented.\r\n\n\r\nWe were silent a few minutes. Glancing round the room she said, \u201cThere are\r\nseveral things here that used to be at Bretton! I remember that pincushion and\r\nthat looking-glass.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEvidently she was not deceived in her estimate of her own memory; not, at\r\nleast, so far.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou think, then, you would have known Mrs. Bretton?\u201d I went on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI perfectly remembered her; the turn of her features, her olive complexion,\r\nand black hair, her height, her walk, her voice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton, of course,\u201d I pursued, \u201cwould be out of the question: and,\r\nindeed, as I saw your first interview with him, I am aware that he appeared to\r\nyou as a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat first night I was puzzled,\u201d she answered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did the recognition between him and your father come about?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey exchanged cards. The names Graham Bretton and Home de Bassompierre gave\r\nrise to questions and explanations. That was on the second day; but before then\r\nI was beginning to know something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2014know something?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d she said, \u201chow strange it is that most people seem so slow to feel the\r\ntruth\u2014not to see, but feel! When Dr. Bretton had visited me a few times,\r\nand sat near and talked to me; when I had observed the look in his eyes, the\r\nexpression about his mouth, the form of his chin, the carriage of his head, and\r\nall that we do observe in persons who approach us\u2014how could I avoid\r\nbeing led by association to think of Graham Bretton? Graham was slighter than\r\nhe, and not grown so tall, and had a smoother face, and longer and lighter\r\nhair, and spoke\u2014not so deeply\u2014more like a girl; but yet he is Graham,\r\njust as I am little Polly, or you are Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought the same, but I wondered to find my thoughts hers: there are certain\r\nthings in which we so rarely meet with our double that it seems a miracle when\r\nthat chance befalls.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou and Graham were once playmates.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you remember that?\u201d she questioned in her turn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt he will remember it also,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have not asked him: few things would surprise me so much as to find that he\r\ndid. I suppose his disposition is still gay and careless?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it so formerly? Did it so strike you? Do you thus remember him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI scarcely remember him in any other light. Sometimes he was studious;\r\nsometimes he was merry: but whether busy with his books or disposed for play,\r\nit was chiefly the books or game he thought of; not much heeding those with\r\nwhom he read or amused himself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet to you he was partial.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPartial to me? Oh, no! he had other playmates\u2014his school-fellows; I was of\r\nlittle consequence to him, except on Sundays: yes, he was kind on Sundays. I\r\nremember walking with him hand-in-hand to St. Mary\u2019s, and his finding the\r\nplaces in my prayer-book; and how good and still he was on Sunday evenings! So\r\nmild for such a proud, lively boy; so patient with all my blunders in reading;\r\nand so wonderfully to be depended on, for he never spent those evenings from\r\nhome: I had a constant fear that he would accept some invitation and forsake\r\nus; but he never did, nor seemed ever to wish to do it. Thus, of course, it can\r\nbe no more. I suppose Sunday will now be Dr. Bretton\u2019s dining-out day\u2026.?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChildren, come down!\u201d here called Mrs. Bretton from below. Paulina would still\r\nhave lingered, but I inclined to descend: we went down.\r\n\n"}
{"26": "\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE LITTLE COUNTESS.\n\r\nCheerful as my godmother naturally was, and entertaining as, for our sakes, she\r\nmade a point of being, there was no true enjoyment that evening at La Terrasse,\r\ntill, through the wild howl of the winter-night, were heard the signal sounds\r\nof arrival. How often, while women and girls sit warm at snug fire-sides, their\r\nhearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding\r\ntheir persons, forced out by night to wander through dark ways, to dare stress\r\nof weather, to contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely gates and stiles\r\nin wildest storms, watching and listening to see and hear the father, the son,\r\nthe husband coming home.\r\n\n\r\nFather and son came at last to the ch\u00e2teau: for the Count de Bassompierre that\r\nnight accompanied Dr. Bretton. I know not which of our trio heard the horses\r\nfirst; the asperity, the violence of the weather warranted our running down\r\ninto the hall to meet and greet the two riders as they came in; but they warned\r\nus to keep our distance: both were white\u2014two mountains of snow; and indeed Mrs.\r\nBretton, seeing their condition, ordered them instantly to the kitchen;\r\nprohibiting them, at their peril, from setting foot on her carpeted staircase\r\ntill they had severally put off that mask of Old Christmas they now affected.\r\nInto the kitchen, however, we could not help following them: it was a large old\r\nDutch kitchen, picturesque and pleasant. The little white Countess danced in a\r\ncircle about her equally white sire, clapping her hands and crying, \u201cPapa,\r\npapa, you look like an enormous Polar bear.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe bear shook himself, and the little sprite fled far from the frozen shower.\r\nBack she came, however, laughing, and eager to aid in removing the arctic\r\ndisguise. The Count, at last issuing from his dreadnought, threatened to\r\noverwhelm her with it as with an avalanche.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, then,\u201d said she, bending to invite the fall, and when it was playfully\r\nadvanced above her head, bounding out of reach like some little chamois.\r\n\n\r\nHer movements had the supple softness, the velvet grace of a kitten; her laugh\r\nwas clearer than the ring of silver and crystal; as she took her sire\u2019s cold\r\nhands and rubbed them, and stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a kiss, there\r\nseemed to shine round her a halo of loving delight. The grave and reverend\r\nseignor looked down on her as men do look on what is the apple of their\r\neye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bretton,\u201d said he: \u201cwhat am I to do with this daughter or daughterling of\r\nmine? She neither grows in wisdom nor in stature. Don\u2019t you find her pretty\r\nnearly as much the child as she was ten years ago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe cannot be more the child than this great boy of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Bretton,\r\nwho was in conflict with her son about some change of dress she deemed\r\nadvisable, and which he resisted. He stood leaning against the Dutch dresser,\r\nlaughing and keeping her at arm\u2019s length.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, mamma,\u201d said he, \u201cby way of compromise, and to secure for us inward as\r\nwell as outward warmth, let us have a Christmas wassail-cup, and toast Old\r\nEngland here, on the hearth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo, while the Count stood by the fire, and Paulina Mary still danced to and\r\nfro\u2014happy in the liberty of the wide hall-like kitchen\u2014Mrs. Bretton herself\r\ninstructed Martha to spice and heat the wassail-bowl, and, pouring the draught\r\ninto a Bretton flagon, it was served round, reaming hot, by means of a small\r\nsilver vessel, which I recognised as Graham\u2019s christening-cup.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s to Auld Lang Syne!\u201d said the Count; holding the glancing cup on high.\r\nThen, looking at Mrs. Bretton.\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe twa ha\u2019 paidlet i\u2019 the burn\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fra morning sun till dine,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0But seas between us braid ha\u2019 roared\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sin\u2019 auld lang syne.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd surely ye\u2019ll be your pint-stoup,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And surely I\u2019ll be mine;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0And we\u2019ll taste a cup o\u2019 kindness yet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For auld lang syne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScotch! Scotch!\u201d cried Paulina; \u201cpapa is talking Scotch; and Scotch he is,\r\npartly. We are Home and de Bassompierre, Caledonian and Gallic.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that a Scotch reel you are dancing, you Highland fairy?\u201d asked her\r\nfather. \u201cMrs. Bretton, there will be a green ring growing up in the middle of\r\nyour kitchen shortly. I would not answer for her being quite cannie: she is a\r\nstrange little mortal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell Lucy to dance with me, papa; there is Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home (there was still quite as much about him of plain Mr. Home as of proud\r\nCount de Bassompierre) held his hand out to me, saying kindly, \u201che remembered\r\nme well; and, even had his own memory been less trustworthy, my name was so\r\noften on his daughter\u2019s lips, and he had listened to so many long tales about\r\nme, I should seem like an old acquaintance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEvery one now had tasted the wassail-cup except Paulina, whose pas de f\u00e9e, ou\r\nde fantaisie, nobody thought of interrupting to offer so profanatory a draught;\r\nbut she was not to be overlooked, nor baulked of her mortal privileges.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me taste,\u201d said she to Graham, as he was putting the cup on the shelf of\r\nthe dresser out of her reach.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton and Mr. Home were now engaged in conversation. Dr. John had not\r\nbeen unobservant of the fairy\u2019s dance; he had watched it, and he had liked it.\r\nTo say nothing of the softness and beauty of the movements, eminently grateful\r\nto his grace-loving eye, that ease in his mother\u2019s house charmed him, for it\r\nset him at ease: again she seemed a child for him\u2014again, almost his\r\nplaymate. I wondered how he would speak to her; I had not yet seen him address\r\nher; his first words proved that the old days of \u201clittle Polly\u201d had been\r\nrecalled to his mind by this evening\u2019s child-like light-heartedness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour ladyship wishes for the tankard?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I said so. I think I intimated as much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t consent to a step of the kind on any account. Sorry for it, but\r\ncouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy? I am quite well now: it can\u2019t break my collar-bone again, or dislocate my\r\nshoulder. Is it wine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; nor dew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want dew; I don\u2019t like dew: but what is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAle\u2014strong ale\u2014old October; brewed, perhaps, when I was born.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt must be curious: is it good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcessively good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he took it down, administered to himself a second dose of this mighty\r\nelixir, expressed in his mischievous eyes extreme contentment with the same,\r\nand solemnly replaced the cup on the shelf.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should like a little,\u201d said Paulina, looking up; \u201cI never had any \u2018old\r\nOctober:\u2019 is it sweet?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerilously sweet,\u201d said Graham.\r\n\n\r\nShe continued to look up exactly with the countenance of a child that longs for\r\nsome prohibited dainty. At last the Doctor relented, took it down, and indulged\r\nhimself in the gratification of letting her taste from his hand; his eyes,\r\nalways expressive in the revelation of pleasurable feelings, luminously and\r\nsmilingly avowed that it was a gratification; and he prolonged it by so\r\nregulating the position of the cup that only a drop at a time could reach the\r\nrosy, sipping lips by which its brim was courted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little more\u2014a little more,\u201d said she, petulantly touching his hand with the\r\nforefinger, to make him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly. \u201cIt\r\nsmells of spice and sugar, but I can\u2019t taste it; your wrist is so stiff, and\r\nyou are so stingy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe indulged her, whispering, however, with gravity: \u201cDon\u2019t tell my mother or\r\nLucy; they wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNor do I,\u201d said she, passing into another tone and manner as soon as she had\r\nfairly assayed the beverage, just as if it had acted upon her like some\r\ndisenchanting draught, undoing the work of a wizard: \u201cI find it anything but\r\nsweet; it is bitter and hot, and takes away my breath. Your old October was\r\nonly desirable while forbidden. Thank you, no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd, with a slight bend\u2014careless, but as graceful as her dance\u2014she glided from\r\nhim and rejoined her father.\r\n\n\r\nI think she had spoken truth: the child of seven was in the girl of seventeen.\r\n\n\r\nGraham looked after her a little baffled, a little puzzled; his eye was on her\r\na good deal during the rest of the evening, but she did not seem to notice him.\r\n\n\r\nAs we ascended to the drawing-room for tea, she took her father\u2019s arm: her\r\nnatural place seemed to be at his side; her eyes and her ears were dedicated to\r\nhim. He and Mrs. Bretton were the chief talkers of our little party, and\r\nPaulina was their best listener, attending closely to all that was said,\r\nprompting the repetition of this or that trait or adventure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd where were you at such a time, papa? And what did you say then? And tell\r\nMrs. Bretton what happened on that occasion.\u201d Thus she drew him out.\r\n\n\r\nShe did not again yield to any effervescence of glee; the infantine sparkle was\r\nexhaled for the night: she was soft, thoughtful, and docile. It was pretty to\r\nsee her bid good-night; her manner to Graham was touched with dignity: in her\r\nvery slight smile and quiet bow spoke the Countess, and Graham could not but\r\nlook grave, and bend responsive. I saw he hardly knew how to blend together in\r\nhis ideas the dancing fairy and delicate dame.\r\n\n\r\nNext day, when we were all assembled round the breakfast-table, shivering and\r\nfresh from the morning\u2019s chill ablutions, Mrs. Bretton pronounced a decree that\r\nnobody, who was not forced by dire necessity, should quit her house that day.\r\n\n\r\nIndeed, egress seemed next to impossible; the drift darkened the lower panes of\r\nthe casement, and, on looking out, one saw the sky and air vexed and dim, the\r\nwind and snow in angry conflict. There was no fall now, but what had already\r\ndescended was torn up from the earth, whirled round by brief shrieking gusts,\r\nand cast into a hundred fantastic forms.\r\n\n\r\nThe Countess seconded Mrs. Bretton.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa shall not go out,\u201d said she, placing a seat for herself beside her\r\nfather\u2019s arm-chair. \u201cI will look after him. You won\u2019t go into town, will you,\r\npapa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy, and No,\u201d was the answer. \u201cIf you and Mrs. Bretton are very good to\r\nme, Polly\u2014kind, you know, and attentive; if you pet me in a very nice manner,\r\nand make much of me, I may possibly be induced to wait an hour after breakfast\r\nand see whether this razor-edged wind settles. But, you see, you give me no\r\nbreakfast; you offer me nothing: you let me starve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuick! please, Mrs. Bretton, and pour out the coffee,\u201d entreated Paulina,\r\n\u201cwhilst I take care of the Count de Bassompierre in other respects: since he\r\ngrew into a Count, he has needed so much attention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe separated and prepared a roll.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, papa, are your \u2018pistolets\u2019 charged,\u201d said she. \u201cAnd there is some\r\nmarmalade, just the same sort of marmalade we used to have at Bretton, and\r\nwhich you said was as good as if it had been conserved in Scotland\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd which your little ladyship used to beg for my boy\u2014do you remember that?\u201d\r\ninterposed Mrs. Bretton. \u201cHave you forgotten how you would come to my elbow and\r\ntouch my sleeve with the whisper, \u2018Please, ma\u2019am, something good for Graham\u2014a\r\nlittle marmalade, or honey, or jam?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, mamma,\u201d broke in Dr. John, laughing, yet reddening; \u201cit surely was not so:\r\nI could not have cared for these things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid he or did he not, Paulina?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe liked them,\u201d asserted Paulina.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever blush for it, John,\u201d said Mr. Home, encouragingly. \u201cI like them myself\r\nyet, and always did. And Polly showed her sense in catering for a friend\u2019s\r\nmaterial comforts: it was I who put her into the way of such good manners\u2014nor\r\ndo I let her forget them. Polly, offer me a small slice of that tongue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, papa: but remember you are only waited upon with this assiduity; on\r\ncondition of being persuadable, and reconciling yourself to La Terrasse for the\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bretton,\u201d said the Count, \u201cI want to get rid of my daughter\u2014to send her\r\nto school. Do you know of any good school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is Lucy\u2019s place\u2014Madame Beck\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe is in a school?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am a teacher,\u201d I said, and was rather glad of the opportunity of saying\r\nthis. For a little while I had been feeling as if placed in a false position.\r\nMrs. Bretton and son knew my circumstances; but the Count and his daughter did\r\nnot. They might choose to vary by some shades their hitherto cordial manner\r\ntowards me, when aware of my grade in society. I spoke then readily: but a\r\nswarm of thoughts I had not anticipated nor invoked, rose dim at the words,\r\nmaking me sigh involuntarily. Mr. Home did not lift his eyes from his\r\nbreakfast-plate for about two minutes, nor did he speak; perhaps he had not\r\ncaught the words\u2014perhaps he thought that on a confession of that nature,\r\npoliteness would interdict comment: the Scotch are proverbially proud; and\r\nhomely as was Mr. Home in look, simple in habits and tastes, I have all along\r\nintimated that he was not without his share of the national quality. Was his a\r\npseudo pride? was it real dignity? I leave the question undecided in its wide\r\nsense. Where it concerned me individually I can only answer: then, and always,\r\nhe showed himself a true-hearted gentleman.\r\n\n\r\nBy nature he was a feeler and a thinker; over his emotions and his reflections\r\nspread a mellowing of melancholy; more than a mellowing: in trouble and\r\nbereavement it became a cloud. He did not know much about Lucy Snowe; what he\r\nknew, he did not very accurately comprehend: indeed his misconceptions of my\r\ncharacter often made me smile; but he saw my walk in life lay rather on the\r\nshady side of the hill: he gave me credit for doing my endeavour to keep the\r\ncourse honestly straight; he would have helped me if he could: having no\r\nopportunity of helping, he still wished me well. When he did look at me, his\r\neye was kind; when he did speak, his voice was benevolent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYours,\u201d said he, \u201cis an arduous calling. I wish you health and strength to win\r\nin it\u2014success.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis fair little daughter did not take the information quite so composedly: she\r\nfixed on me a pair of eyes wide with wonder\u2014almost with dismay.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you a teacher?\u201d cried she. Then, having paused on the unpalatable idea,\r\n\u201cWell, I never knew what you were, nor ever thought of asking: for me, you were\r\nalways Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what am I now?\u201d I could not forbear inquiring.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYourself, of course. But do you really teach here, in Villette?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI really do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you like it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd why do you go on with it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHer father looked at, and, I feared, was going to check her; but he only said,\r\n\u201cProceed, Polly, proceed with that catechism\u2014prove yourself the little wiseacre\r\nyou are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused, I should have to bid\r\nyou hold your tongue; and you and I would sit out the present meal in some\r\ndisgrace; but she only smiles, so push her hard, multiply the cross-questions.\r\nWell, Miss Snowe, why do you go on with it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChiefly, I fear, for the sake of the money I get.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot then from motives of pure philanthropy? Polly and I were clinging to that\r\nhypothesis as the most lenient way of accounting for your eccentricity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014no, sir. Rather for the roof of shelter I am thus enabled to keep over my\r\nhead; and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that while I can work\r\nfor myself, I am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, say what you will, I pity Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake up that pity, Miss de Bassompierre; take it up in both hands, as you\r\nmight a little callow gosling squattering out of bounds without leave; put it\r\nback in the warm nest of a heart whence it issued, and receive in your ear this\r\nwhisper. If my Polly ever came to know by experience the uncertain nature of\r\nthis world\u2019s goods, I should like her to act as Lucy acts: to work for herself,\r\nthat she might burden neither kith nor kin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, papa,\u201d said she, pensively and tractably. \u201cBut poor Lucy! I thought she\r\nwas a rich lady, and had rich friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought like a little simpleton. I never thought so. When I had\r\ntime to consider Lucy\u2019s manner and aspect, which was not often, I saw she was\r\none who had to guard and not be guarded; to act and not be served: and this lot\r\nhas, I imagine, helped her to an experience for which, if she live long enough\r\nto realize its full benefit, she may yet bless Providence. But this school,\u201d he\r\npursued, changing his tone from grave to gay: \u201cwould Madame Beck admit my\r\nPolly, do you think, Miss Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, there needed but to try Madame; it would soon be seen: she was fond of\r\nEnglish pupils. \u201cIf you, sir,\u201d I added, \u201cwill but take Miss de Bassompierre in\r\nyour carriage this very afternoon, I think I can answer for it that Rosine, the\r\nportress, will not be very slow in answering your ring; and Madame, I am sure,\r\nwill put on her best pair of gloves to come into the salon to receive you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d responded Mr. Home, \u201cI see no sort of necessity there is for\r\ndelay. Mrs. Hurst can send what she calls her young lady\u2019s \u2018things\u2019 after her;\r\nPolly can settle down to her horn-book before night; and you, Miss Lucy, I\r\ntrust, will not disdain to cast an occasional eye upon her, and let me know,\r\nfrom time to time, how she gets on. I hope you approve of the arrangement,\r\nCountess de Bassompierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe Countess hemmed and hesitated. \u201cI thought,\u201d said she, \u201cI thought I had\r\nfinished my education\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat only proves how much we may be mistaken in our thoughts. I hold a far\r\ndifferent opinion, as most of these will who have been auditors of your\r\nprofound knowledge of life this morning. Ah, my little girl, thou hast much to\r\nlearn; and papa ought to have taught thee more than he has done! Come, there is\r\nnothing for it but to try Madame Beck; and the weather seems settling, and I\r\nhave finished my breakfast\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, papa!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see an obstacle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is enormous, papa; it can never be got over; it is as large as you in your\r\ngreatcoat, and the snowdrift on the top.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd, like that snowdrift, capable of melting?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo! it is of too\u2014too solid flesh: it is just your own self. Miss Lucy, warn\r\nMadame Beck not to listen to any overtures about taking me, because, in the\r\nend, it would turn out that she would have to take papa too: as he is so\r\nteasing, I will just tell tales about him. Mrs. Bretton and all of you listen:\r\nAbout five years ago, when I was twelve years old, he took it into his head\r\nthat he was spoiling me; that I was growing unfitted for the world, and I don\u2019t\r\nknow what, and nothing would serve or satisfy him, but I must go to school. I\r\ncried, and so on; but M. de Bassompierre proved hard-hearted, quite firm and\r\nflinty, and to school I went. What was the result? In the most admirable\r\nmanner, papa came to school likewise: every other day he called to see me.\r\nMadame Aigredoux grumbled, but it was of no use; and so, at last, papa and I\r\nwere both, in a manner, expelled. Lucy can just tell Madame Beck this little\r\ntrait: it is only fair to let her know what she has to expect.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Bretton asked Mr. Home what he had to say in answer to this statement. As\r\nhe made no defence, judgment was given against him, and Paulina triumphed.\r\n\n\r\nBut she had other moods besides the arch and na\u00efve. After breakfast; when the\r\ntwo elders withdrew\u2014I suppose to talk over certain of Mrs. Bretton\u2019s business\r\nmatters\u2014and the Countess, Dr. Bretton, and I, were for a short time alone\r\ntogether\u2014all the child left her; with us, more nearly her companions in age,\r\nshe rose at once to the little lady: her very face seemed to alter; that play\r\nof feature, and candour of look, which, when she spoke to her father, made it\r\nquite dimpled and round, yielded to an aspect more thoughtful, and lines\r\ndistincter and less mobile.\r\n\n\r\nNo doubt Graham noted the change as well as I. He stood for some minutes near\r\nthe window, looking out at the snow; presently he approached the hearth, and\r\nentered into conversation, but not quite with his usual ease: fit topics did\r\nnot seem to rise to his lips; he chose them fastidiously, hesitatingly, and\r\nconsequently infelicitously: he spoke vaguely of Villette\u2014its inhabitants, its\r\nnotable sights and buildings. He was answered by Miss de Bassompierre in quite\r\nwomanly sort; with intelligence, with a manner not indeed wholly\r\ndisindividualized: a tone, a glance, a gesture, here and there, rather animated\r\nand quick than measured and stately, still recalled little Polly; but yet there\r\nwas so fine and even a polish, so calm and courteous a grace, gilding and\r\nsustaining these peculiarities, that a less sensitive man than Graham would not\r\nhave ventured to seize upon them as vantage points, leading to franker\r\nintimacy.\r\n\n\r\nYet while Dr. Bretton continued subdued, and, for him, sedate, he was still\r\nobservant. Not one of those petty impulses and natural breaks escaped him. He\r\ndid not miss one characteristic movement, one hesitation in language, or one\r\nlisp in utterance. At times, in speaking fast, she still lisped; but coloured\r\nwhenever such lapse occurred, and in a painstaking, conscientious manner, quite\r\nas amusing as the slight error, repeated the word more distinctly.\r\n\n\r\nWhenever she did this, Dr. Bretton smiled. Gradually, as they conversed, the\r\nrestraint on each side slackened: might the conference have but been prolonged,\r\nI believe it would soon have become genial: already to Paulina\u2019s lip and cheek\r\nreturned the wreathing, dimpling smile; she lisped once, and forgot to correct\r\nherself. And Dr. John, I know not how he changed, but change he did. He\r\ndid not grow gayer\u2014no raillery, no levity sparkled across his aspect\u2014but his\r\nposition seemed to become one of more pleasure to himself, and he spoke his\r\naugmented comfort in readier language, in tones more suave. Ten years ago this\r\npair had always found abundance to say to each other; the intervening decade\r\nhad not narrowed the experience or impoverished the intelligence of either:\r\nbesides, there are certain natures of which the mutual influence is such, that\r\nthe more they say, the more they have to say. For these out of association\r\ngrows adhesion, and out of adhesion, amalgamation.\r\n\n\r\nGraham, however, must go: his was a profession whose claims are neither to be\r\nignored nor deferred. He left the room; but before he could leave the house\r\nthere was a return. I am sure he came back\u2014not for the paper, or card in his\r\ndesk, which formed his ostensible errand\u2014but to assure himself, by one more\r\nglance, that Paulina\u2019s aspect was really such as memory was bearing away: that\r\nhe had not been viewing her somehow by a partial, artificial light, and making\r\na fond mistake. No! he found the impression true\u2014rather, indeed, he gained than\r\nlost by this return: he took away with him a parting look\u2014shy, but very soft\u2014as\r\nbeautiful, as innocent, as any little fawn could lift out of its cover of fern,\r\nor any lamb from its meadow-bed.\r\n\n\r\nBeing left alone, Paulina and I kept silence for some time: we both took out\r\nsome work, and plied a mute and diligent task. The white-wood workbox of old\r\ndays was now replaced by one inlaid with precious mosaic, and furnished with\r\nimplements of gold; the tiny and trembling fingers that could scarce guide the\r\nneedle, though tiny still, were now swift and skilful: but there was the same\r\nbusy knitting of the brow, the same little dainty mannerisms, the same quick\r\nturns and movements\u2014now to replace a stray tress, and anon to shake from the\r\nsilken skirt some imaginary atom of dust\u2014some clinging fibre of thread.\r\n\n\r\nThat morning I was disposed for silence: the austere fury of the winter-day had\r\non me an awing, hushing influence. That passion of January, so white and so\r\nbloodless, was not yet spent: the storm had raved itself hoarse, but seemed no\r\nnearer exhaustion. Had Ginevra Fanshawe been my companion in that drawing-room,\r\nshe would not have suffered me to muse and listen undisturbed. The presence\r\njust gone from us would have been her theme; and how she would have rung the\r\nchanges on one topic! how she would have pursued and pestered me with questions\r\nand surmises\u2014worried and oppressed me with comments and confidences I did not\r\nwant, and longed to avoid.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina Mary cast once or twice towards me a quiet but penetrating glance of\r\nher dark, full eye; her lips half opened, as if to the impulse of coming\r\nutterance: but she saw and delicately respected my inclination for silence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis will not hold long,\u201d I thought to myself; for I was not accustomed to\r\nfind in women or girls any power of self-control, or strength of self-denial.\r\nAs far as I knew them, the chance of a gossip about their usually trivial\r\nsecrets, their often very washy and paltry feelings, was a treat not to be\r\nreadily foregone.\r\n\n\r\nThe little Countess promised an exception: she sewed till she was tired of\r\nsewing, and then she took a book.\r\n\n\r\nAs chance would have it, she had sought it in Dr. Bretton\u2019s own compartment of\r\nthe bookcase; and it proved to be an old Bretton book\u2014some illustrated work of\r\nnatural history. Often had I seen her standing at Graham\u2019s side, resting that\r\nvolume on his knee, and reading to his tuition; and, when the lesson was over,\r\nbegging, as a treat, that he would tell her all about the pictures. I watched\r\nher keenly: here was a true test of that memory she had boasted; would her\r\nrecollections now be faithful?\r\n\n\r\nFaithful? It could not be doubted. As she turned the leaves, over her face\r\npassed gleam after gleam of expression, the least intelligent of which was a\r\nfull greeting to the Past. And then she turned to the title-page, and looked at\r\nthe name written in the schoolboy hand. She looked at it long; nor was she\r\nsatisfied with merely looking: she gently passed over the characters the tips\r\nof her fingers, accompanying the action with an unconscious but tender smile,\r\nwhich converted the touch into a caress. Paulina loved the Past; but the\r\npeculiarity of this little scene was, that she said nothing: she could\r\nfeel without pouring out her feelings in a flux of words.\r\n\n\r\nShe now occupied herself at the bookcase for nearly an hour; taking down volume\r\nafter volume, and renewing her acquaintance with each. This done, she seated\r\nherself on a low stool, rested her cheek on her hand, and thought, and still\r\nwas mute.\r\n\n\r\nThe sound of the front door opened below, a rush of cold wind, and her father\u2019s\r\nvoice speaking to Mrs. Bretton in the hall, startled her at last. She sprang\r\nup: she was down-stairs in one second.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa! papa! you are not going out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy pet, I must go into town.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut it is too\u2014too cold, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd then I heard M. de Bassompierre showing to her how he was well provided\r\nagainst the weather; and how he was going to have the carriage, and to be quite\r\nsnugly sheltered; and, in short, proving that she need not fear for his\r\ncomfort.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you will promise to come back here this evening, before it is quite\r\ndark;\u2014you and Dr. Bretton, both, in the carriage? It is not fit to ride.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, if I see the Doctor, I will tell him a lady has laid on him her commands\r\nto take care of his precious health and come home early under my escort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, you must say a lady; and he will think it is his mother, and be obedient.\r\nAnd, papa, mind to come soon, for I shall watch and listen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe door closed, and the carriage rolled softly through the snow; and back\r\nreturned the Countess, pensive and anxious.\r\n\n\r\nShe did listen, and watch, when evening closed; but it was in stillest\r\nsort: walking the drawing-room with quite noiseless step. She checked at\r\nintervals her velvet march; inclined her ear, and consulted the night sounds: I\r\nshould rather say, the night silence; for now, at last, the wind was fallen.\r\nThe sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay naked and pale: through the barren\r\nboughs of the avenue we could see it well, and note also the polar splendour of\r\nthe new-year moon\u2014an orb white as a world of ice. Nor was it late when we saw\r\nalso the return of the carriage.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina had no dance of welcome for this evening. It was with a sort of gravity\r\nthat she took immediate possession of her father, as he entered the room; but\r\nshe at once made him her entire property, led him to the seat of her choice,\r\nand, while softly showering round him honeyed words of commendation for being\r\nso good and coming home so soon, you would have thought it was entirely by the\r\npower of her little hands he was put into his chair, and settled and arranged;\r\nfor the strong man seemed to take pleasure in wholly yielding himself to this\r\ndominion-potent only by love.\r\n\n\r\nGraham did not appear till some minutes after the Count. Paulina half turned\r\nwhen his step was heard: they spoke, but only a word or two; their fingers met\r\na moment, but obviously with slight contact. Paulina remained beside her\r\nfather; Graham threw himself into a seat on the other side of the room.\r\n\n\r\nIt was well that Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home had a great deal to say to each\r\nother\u2014almost an inexhaustible fund of discourse in old recollections;\r\notherwise, I think, our party would have been but a still one that evening.\r\n\n\r\nAfter tea, Paulina\u2019s quick needle and pretty golden thimble were busily plied\r\nby the lamp-light, but her tongue rested, and her eyes seemed reluctant to\r\nraise often their lids, so smooth and so full-fringed. Graham, too, must have\r\nbeen tired with his day\u2019s work: he listened dutifully to his elders and\r\nbetters, said very little himself, and followed with his eye the gilded glance\r\nof Paulina\u2019s thimble; as if it had been some bright moth on the wing, or the\r\ngolden head of some darting little yellow serpent.\r\n\n"}
{"27": "\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA BURIAL.\n\r\nFrom this date my life did not want variety; I went out a good deal, with the\r\nentire consent of Madame Beck, who perfectly approved the grade of my\r\nacquaintance. That worthy directress had never from the first treated me\r\notherwise than with respect; and when she found that I was liable to frequent\r\ninvitations from a ch\u00e2teau and a great hotel, respect improved into\r\ndistinction.\r\n\n\r\nNot that she was fulsome about it: Madame, in all things worldly, was in\r\nnothing weak; there was measure and sense in her hottest pursuit of\r\nself-interest, calm and considerateness in her closest clutch of gain; without,\r\nthen, laying herself open to my contempt as a time-server and a toadie, she\r\nmarked with tact that she was pleased people connected with her establishment\r\nshould frequent such associates as must cultivate and elevate, rather than\r\nthose who might deteriorate and depress. She never praised either me or my\r\nfriends; only once when she was sitting in the sun in the garden, a cup of\r\ncoffee at her elbow and the Gazette in her hand, looking very comfortable, and\r\nI came up and asked leave of absence for the evening, she delivered herself in\r\nthis gracious sort:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOui, oui, ma bonne amie: je vous donne la permission de c\u0153ur et de gr\u00e9. Votre\r\ntravail dans ma maison a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 admirable, rempli de z\u00e8le et de\r\ndiscr\u00e9tion: vous avez bien le droit de vous amuser. Sortez donc tant que vous\r\nvoudrez. Quant \u00e0 votre choix de connaissances, j\u2019en suis contente; c\u2019est sage,\r\ndigne, laudable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe closed her lips and resumed the Gazette.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader will not too gravely regard the little circumstance that about this\r\ntime the triply-enclosed packet of five letters temporarily disappeared from my\r\nbureau. Blank dismay was naturally my first sensation on making the discovery;\r\nbut in a moment I took heart of grace.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPatience!\u201d whispered I to myself. \u201cLet me say nothing, but wait peaceably;\r\nthey will come back again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd they did come back: they had only been on a short visit to Madame\u2019s\r\nchamber; having passed their examination, they came back duly and truly: I\r\nfound them all right the next day.\r\n\n\r\nI wonder what she thought of my correspondence? What estimate did she form of\r\nDr. John Bretton\u2019s epistolary powers? In what light did the often very pithy\r\nthoughts, the generally sound, and sometimes original opinions, set, without\r\npretension, in an easily-flowing, spirited style, appear to her? How did she\r\nlike that genial, half humorous vein, which to me gave such delight? What did\r\nshe think of the few kind words scattered here and there\u2014not thickly, as the\r\ndiamonds were scattered in the valley of Sindbad, but sparely, as those gems\r\nlie in unfabled beds? Oh, Madame Beck! how seemed these things to you?\r\n\n\r\nI think in Madame Beck\u2019s eyes the five letters found a certain favour. One day\r\nafter she had borrowed them of me (in speaking of so suave a little\r\nwoman, one ought to use suave terms), I caught her examining me with a steady\r\ncontemplative gaze, a little puzzled, but not at all malevolent. It was during\r\nthat brief space between lessons, when the pupils turned out into the court for\r\na quarter of an hour\u2019s recreation; she and I remained in the first classe\r\nalone: when I met her eye, her thoughts forced themselves partially through her\r\nlips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIl y a,\u201d said she, \u201cquelquechose de bien remarquable dans le caract\u00e8re\r\nAnglais.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow, Madame?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh, repeating the word \u201chow\u201d in English.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe ne saurais vous dire \u2018how;\u2019 mais, enfin, les Anglais ont des id\u00e9es \u00e0 eux,\r\nen amiti\u00e9, en amour, en tout. Mais au moins il n\u2019est pas besoin de les\r\nsurveiller,\u201d she added, getting up and trotting away like the compact little\r\npony she was.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I hope,\u201d murmured I to myself, \u201cyou will graciously let alone my letters\r\nfor the future.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAlas! something came rushing into my eyes, dimming utterly their vision,\r\nblotting from sight the schoolroom, the garden, the bright winter sun, as I\r\nremembered that never more would letters, such as she had read, come to me. I\r\nhad seen the last of them. That goodly river on whose banks I had sojourned, of\r\nwhose waves a few reviving drops had trickled to my lips, was bending to\r\nanother course: it was leaving my little hut and field forlorn and sand-dry,\r\npouring its wealth of waters far away. The change was right, just, natural; not\r\na word could be said: but I loved my Rhine, my Nile; I had almost worshipped my\r\nGanges, and I grieved that the grand tide should roll estranged, should vanish\r\nlike a false mirage. Though stoical, I was not quite a stoic; drops streamed\r\nfast on my hands, on my desk: I wept one sultry shower, heavy and brief.\r\n\n\r\nBut soon I said to myself, \u201cThe Hope I am bemoaning suffered and made me suffer\r\nmuch: it did not die till it was full time: following an agony so lingering,\r\ndeath ought to be welcome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWelcome I endeavoured to make it. Indeed, long pain had made patience a habit.\r\nIn the end I closed the eyes of my dead, covered its face, and composed its\r\nlimbs with great calm.\r\n\n\r\nThe letters, however, must be put away, out of sight: people who have undergone\r\nbereavement always jealously gather together and lock away mementos: it is not\r\nsupportable to be stabbed to the heart each moment by sharp revival of regret.\r\n\n\r\nOne vacant holiday afternoon (the Thursday) going to my treasure, with intent\r\nto consider its final disposal, I perceived\u2014and this time with a strong impulse\r\nof displeasure\u2014that it had been again tampered with: the packet was there,\r\nindeed, but the ribbon which secured it had been untied and retied; and by\r\nother symptoms I knew that my drawer had been visited.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a little too much. Madame Beck herself was the soul of discretion,\r\nbesides having as strong a brain and sound a judgment as ever furnished a human\r\nhead; that she should know the contents of my casket, was not pleasant, but\r\nmight be borne. Little Jesuit inquisitress as she was, she could see things in\r\na true light, and understand them in an unperverted sense; but the idea that\r\nshe had ventured to communicate information, thus gained, to others; that she\r\nhad, perhaps, amused herself with a companion over documents, in my eyes most\r\nsacred, shocked me cruelly. Yet, that such was the case I now saw reason to\r\nfear; I even guessed her confidant. Her kinsman, M. Paul Emanuel, had spent\r\nyesterday evening with her: she was much in the habit of consulting him, and of\r\ndiscussing with him matters she broached to no one else. This very morning, in\r\nclass, that gentleman had favoured me with a glance which he seemed to have\r\nborrowed from Vashti, the actress; I had not at the moment comprehended that\r\nblue, yet lurid, flash out of his angry eye; but I read its meaning now.\r\nHe, I believed, was not apt to regard what concerned me from a fair\r\npoint of view, nor to judge me with tolerance and candour: I had always found\r\nhim severe and suspicious: the thought that these letters, mere friendly\r\nletters as they were, had fallen once, and might fall again, into his hands,\r\njarred my very soul.\r\n\n\r\nWhat should I do to prevent this? In what corner of this strange house was it\r\npossible to find security or secresy? Where could a key be a safeguard, or a\r\npadlock a barrier?\r\n\n\r\nIn the grenier? No, I did not like the grenier. Besides, most of the boxes and\r\ndrawers there were mouldering, and did not lock. Rats, too, gnawed their way\r\nthrough the decayed wood; and mice made nests amongst the litter of their\r\ncontents: my dear letters (most dear still, though Ichabod was written on their\r\ncovers) might be consumed by vermin; certainly the writing would soon become\r\nobliterated by damp. No; the grenier would not do\u2014but where then?\r\n\n\r\nWhile pondering this problem, I sat in the dormitory window-seat. It was a fine\r\nfrosty afternoon; the winter sun, already setting, gleamed pale on the tops of\r\nthe garden-shrubs in the \u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue.\u201d One great old pear-tree\u2014the nun\u2019s\r\npear-tree\u2014stood up a tall dryad skeleton, grey, gaunt, and stripped. A thought\r\nstruck me\u2014one of those queer fantastic thoughts that will sometimes strike\r\nsolitary people. I put on my bonnet, cloak, and furs, and went out into the\r\ncity.\r\n\n\r\nBending my steps to the old historical quarter of the town, whose hoar and\r\novershadowed precincts I always sought by instinct in melancholy moods, I\r\nwandered on from street to street, till, having crossed a half deserted \u201cplace\u201d\r\nor square, I found myself before a sort of broker\u2019s shop; an ancient place,\r\nfull of ancient things. What I wanted was a metal box which might be soldered,\r\nor a thick glass jar or bottle which might be stoppered or sealed hermetically.\r\nAmongst miscellaneous heaps, I found and purchased the latter article.\r\n\n\r\nI then made a little roll of my letters, wrapped them in oiled silk, bound them\r\nwith twine, and, having put them in the bottle, got the old Jew broker to\r\nstopper, seal, and make it air-tight. While obeying my directions, he glanced\r\nat me now and then suspiciously from under his frost-white eyelashes. I believe\r\nhe thought there was some evil deed on hand. In all this I had a dreary\r\nsomething\u2014not pleasure\u2014but a sad, lonely satisfaction. The impulse under which\r\nI acted, the mood controlling me, were similar to the impulse and the mood\r\nwhich had induced me to visit the confessional. With quick walking I regained\r\nthe pensionnat just at dark, and in time for dinner.\r\n\n\r\nAt seven o\u2019clock the moon rose. At half-past seven, when the pupils and\r\nteachers were at study, and Madame Beck was with her mother and children in the\r\nsalle-\u00e0-manger, when the half-boarders were all gone home, and Rosine had left\r\nthe vestibule, and all was still\u2014I shawled myself, and, taking the sealed jar,\r\nstole out through the first-classe door, into the berceau and thence into the\r\n\u201call\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMethusaleh, the pear-tree, stood at the further end of this walk, near my seat:\r\nhe rose up, dim and gray, above the lower shrubs round him. Now Methusaleh,\r\nthough so very old, was of sound timber still; only there was a hole, or rather\r\na deep hollow, near his root. I knew there was such a hollow, hidden partly by\r\nivy and creepers growing thick round; and there I meditated hiding my treasure.\r\nBut I was not only going to hide a treasure\u2014I meant also to bury a grief. That\r\ngrief over which I had lately been weeping, as I wrapped it in its\r\nwinding-sheet, must be interred.\r\n\n\r\nWell, I cleared away the ivy, and found the hole; it was large enough to\r\nreceive the jar, and I thrust it deep in. In a tool-shed at the bottom of the\r\ngarden, lay the relics of building-materials, left by masons lately employed to\r\nrepair a part of the premises. I fetched thence a slate and some mortar, put\r\nthe slate on the hollow, secured it with cement, covered the hole with black\r\nmould, and, finally, replaced the ivy. This done, I rested, leaning against the\r\ntree; lingering, like any other mourner, beside a newly-sodded grave.\r\n\n\r\nThe air of the night was very still, but dim with a peculiar mist, which\r\nchanged the moonlight into a luminous haze. In this air, or this mist, there\r\nwas some quality\u2014electrical, perhaps\u2014which acted in strange sort upon me. I\r\nfelt then as I had felt a year ago in England\u2014on a night when the aurora\r\nborealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven, when, belated in lonely\r\nfields, I had paused to watch that mustering of an army with banners\u2014that\r\nquivering of serried lances\u2014that swift ascent of messengers from below the\r\nnorth star to the dark, high keystone of heaven\u2019s arch. I felt, not happy, far\r\notherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.\r\n\n\r\nIf life be a war, it seemed my destiny to conduct it single-handed. I pondered\r\nnow how to break up my winter-quarters\u2014to leave an encampment where food and\r\nforage failed. Perhaps, to effect this change, another pitched battle must be\r\nfought with fortune; if so, I had a mind to the encounter: too poor to lose,\r\nGod might destine me to gain. But what road was open?\u2014what plan available?\r\n\n\r\nOn this question I was still pausing, when the moon, so dim hitherto, seemed to\r\nshine out somewhat brighter: a ray gleamed even white before me, and a shadow\r\nbecame distinct and marked. I looked more narrowly, to make out the cause of\r\nthis well-defined contrast appearing a little suddenly in the obscure alley:\r\nwhiter and blacker it grew on my eye: it took shape with instantaneous\r\ntransformation. I stood about three yards from a tall, sable-robed,\r\nsnowy-veiled woman.\r\n\n\r\nFive minutes passed. I neither fled nor shrieked. She was there still. I spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho are you? and why do you come to me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stood mute. She had no face\u2014no features: all below her brow was masked with\r\na white cloth; but she had eyes, and they viewed me.\r\n\n\r\nI felt, if not brave, yet a little desperate; and desperation will often\r\nsuffice to fill the post and do the work of courage. I advanced one step. I\r\nstretched out my hand, for I meant to touch her. She seemed to recede. I drew\r\nnearer: her recession, still silent, became swift. A mass of shrubs,\r\nfull-leaved evergreens, laurel and dense yew, intervened between me and what I\r\nfollowed. Having passed that obstacle, I looked and saw nothing. I waited. I\r\nsaid,\u2014\u201cIf you have any errand to men, come back and deliver it.\u201d Nothing spoke\r\nor re-appeared.\r\n\n\r\nThis time there was no Dr. John to whom to have recourse: there was no one to\r\nwhom I dared whisper the words, \u201cI have again seen the nun.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPaulina Mary sought my frequent presence in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. In the old Bretton\r\ndays, though she had never professed herself fond of me, my society had soon\r\nbecome to her a sort of unconscious necessary. I used to notice that if I\r\nwithdrew to my room, she would speedily come trotting after me, and opening the\r\ndoor and peeping in, say, with her little peremptory accent,\u2014\u201cCome down. Why do\r\nyou sit here by yourself? You must come into the parlour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn the same spirit she urged me now\u2014\u201cLeave the Rue Fossette,\u201d she said, \u201cand\r\ncome and live with us. Papa would give you far more than Madame Beck gives\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Home himself offered me a handsome sum\u2014thrice my present salary\u2014if I would\r\naccept the office of companion to his daughter. I declined. I think I should\r\nhave declined had I been poorer than I was, and with scantier fund of resource,\r\nmore stinted narrowness of future prospect. I had not that vocation. I could\r\nteach; I could give lessons; but to be either a private governess or a\r\ncompanion was unnatural to me. Rather than fill the former post in any great\r\nhouse, I would deliberately have taken a housemaid\u2019s place, bought a strong\r\npair of gloves, swept bedrooms and staircases, and cleaned stoves and locks, in\r\npeace and independence. Rather than be a companion, I would have made shirts\r\nand starved.\r\n\n\r\nI was no bright lady\u2019s shadow\u2014not Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s. Overcast enough it\r\nwas my nature often to be; of a subdued habit I was: but the dimness and\r\ndepression must both be voluntary\u2014such as kept me docile at my desk, in the\r\nmidst of my now well-accustomed pupils in Madame Beck\u2019s first classe; or alone,\r\nat my own bedside, in her dormitory, or in the alley and seat which were called\r\nmine, in her garden: my qualifications were not convertible, nor adaptable;\r\nthey could not be made the foil of any gem, the adjunct of any beauty, the\r\nappendage of any greatness in Christendom. Madame Beck and I, without\r\nassimilating, understood each other well. I was not her companion, nor\r\nher children\u2019s governess; she left me free: she tied me to nothing\u2014not to\r\nherself\u2014not even to her interests: once, when she had for a fortnight been\r\ncalled from home by a near relation\u2019s illness, and on her return, all anxious\r\nand full of care about her establishment, lest something in her absence should\r\nhave gone wrong finding that matters had proceeded much as usual, and that\r\nthere was no evidence of glaring neglect\u2014she made each of the teachers a\r\npresent, in acknowledgment of steadiness. To my bedside she came at twelve\r\no\u2019clock at night, and told me she had no present for me: \u201cI must make fidelity\r\nadvantageous to the St. Pierre,\u201d said she; \u201cif I attempt to make it\r\nadvantageous to you, there will arise misunderstanding between us\u2014perhaps\r\nseparation. One thing, however, I can do to please you\u2014leave you alone\r\nwith your liberty: c\u2019est-ce que je ferai.\u201d She kept her word. Every slight\r\nshackle she had ever laid on me, she, from that time, with quiet hand removed.\r\nThus I had pleasure in voluntarily respecting her rules: gratification in\r\ndevoting double time, in taking double pains with the pupils she committed to\r\nmy charge.\r\n\n\r\nAs to Mary de Bassompierre, I visited her with pleasure, though I would not\r\nlive with her. My visits soon taught me that it was unlikely even my occasional\r\nand voluntary society would long be indispensable to her. M. de Bassompierre,\r\nfor his part, seemed impervious to this conjecture, blind to this possibility;\r\nunconscious as any child to the signs, the likelihoods, the fitful beginnings\r\nof what, when it drew to an end, he might not approve.\r\n\n\r\nWhether or not he would cordially approve, I used to speculate. Difficult to\r\nsay. He was much taken up with scientific interests; keen, intent, and somewhat\r\noppugnant in what concerned his favourite pursuits, but unsuspicious and\r\ntrustful in the ordinary affairs of life. From all I could gather, he seemed to\r\nregard his \u201cdaughterling\u201d as still but a child, and probably had not yet\r\nadmitted the notion that others might look on her in a different light: he\r\nwould speak of what should be done when \u201cPolly\u201d was a woman, when she should be\r\ngrown up; and \u201cPolly,\u201d standing beside his chair, would sometimes smile and\r\ntake his honoured head between her little hands, and kiss his iron-grey locks;\r\nand, at other times, she would pout and toss her curls: but she never said,\r\n\u201cPapa, I am grown up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe had different moods for different people. With her father she really was\r\nstill a child, or child-like, affectionate, merry, and playful. With me she was\r\nserious, and as womanly as thought and feeling could make her. With Mrs.\r\nBretton she was docile and reliant, but not expansive. With Graham she was shy,\r\nat present very shy; at moments she tried to be cold; on occasion she\r\nendeavoured to shun him. His step made her start; his entrance hushed her; when\r\nhe spoke, her answers failed of fluency; when he took leave, she remained\r\nself-vexed and disconcerted. Even her father noticed this demeanour in her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little Polly,\u201d he said once, \u201cyou live too retired a life; if you grow to\r\nbe a woman with these shy manners, you will hardly be fitted for society. You\r\nreally make quite a stranger of Dr. Bretton: how is this? Don\u2019t you remember\r\nthat, as a little girl, you used to be rather partial to him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather, papa,\u201d echoed she, with her slightly dry, yet gentle and simple\r\ntone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like him now? What has he done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Y\u2014e\u2014s, I like him a little; but we are grown strange to each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen rub it off, Polly; rub the rust and the strangeness off. Talk away when\r\nhe is here, and have no fear of him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe does not talk much. Is he afraid of me, do you think, papa?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, to be sure, what man would not be afraid of such a little silent lady?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen tell him some day not to mind my being silent. Say that it is my way, and\r\nthat I have no unfriendly intention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour way, you little chatter-box? So far from being your way, it is only your\r\nwhim!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll improve, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd very pretty was the grace with which, the next day, she tried to keep her\r\nword. I saw her make the effort to converse affably with Dr. John on general\r\ntopics. The attention called into her guest\u2019s face a pleasurable glow; he met\r\nher with caution, and replied to her in his softest tones, as if there was a\r\nkind of gossamer happiness hanging in the air which he feared to disturb by\r\ndrawing too deep a breath. Certainly, in her timid yet earnest advance to\r\nfriendship, it could not be denied that there was a most exquisite and fairy\r\ncharm.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Doctor was gone, she approached her father\u2019s chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I keep my word, papa? Did I behave better?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Polly behaved like a queen. I shall become quite proud of her if this\r\nimprovement continues. By-and-by we shall see her receiving my guests with\r\nquite a calm, grand manner. Miss Lucy and I will have to look about us, and\r\npolish up all our best airs and graces lest we should be thrown into the shade.\r\nStill, Polly, there is a little flutter, a little tendency to stammer now and\r\nthen, and even, to lisp as you lisped when you were six years old.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa,\u201d interrupted she indignantly, \u201cthat can\u2019t be true.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI appeal to Miss Lucy. Did she not, in answering Dr. Bretton\u2019s question as to\r\nwhether she had ever seen the palace of the Prince of Bois l\u2019Etang, say,\r\n\u2018yeth,\u2019 she had been there \u2018theveral\u2019 times?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, you are satirical, you are m\u00e9chant! I can pronounce all the letters of\r\nthe alphabet as clearly as you can. But tell me this you are very particular in\r\nmaking me be civil to Dr. Bretton, do you like him yourself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure: for old acquaintance sake I like him: then he is a very good son\r\nto his mother; besides being a kind-hearted fellow and clever in his\r\nprofession: yes, the callant is well enough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCallant! Ah, Scotchman! Papa, is it the Edinburgh or the Aberdeen\r\naccent you have?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoth, my pet, both: and doubtless the Glaswegian into the bargain. It is that\r\nwhich enables me to speak French so well: a gude Scots tongue always succeeds\r\nwell at the French.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe French! Scotch again: incorrigible papa. You, too, need schooling.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Polly, you must persuade Miss Snowe to undertake both you and me; to\r\nmake you steady and womanly, and me refined and classical.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe light in which M. de Bassompierre evidently regarded \u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d used to\r\noccasion me much inward edification. What contradictory attributes of character\r\nwe sometimes find ascribed to us, according to the eye with which we are\r\nviewed! Madame Beck esteemed me learned and blue; Miss Fanshawe, caustic,\r\nironic, and cynical; Mr. Home, a model teacher, the essence of the sedate and\r\ndiscreet: somewhat conventional, perhaps, too strict, limited, and scrupulous,\r\nbut still the pink and pattern of governess-correctness; whilst another person,\r\nProfessor Paul Emanuel, to wit, never lost an opportunity of intimating his\r\nopinion that mine was rather a fiery and rash nature\u2014adventurous, indocile, and\r\naudacious. I smiled at them all. If any one knew me it was little Paulina Mary.\r\n\n\r\nAs I would not be Paulina\u2019s nominal and paid companion, genial and harmonious\r\nas I began to find her intercourse, she persuaded me to join her in some study,\r\nas a regular and settled means of sustaining communication: she proposed the\r\nGerman language, which, like myself, she found difficult of mastery. We agreed\r\nto take our lessons in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy of the same mistress; this arrangement\r\nthrew us together for some hours of every week. M. de Bassompierre seemed quite\r\npleased: it perfectly met his approbation, that Madame Minerva Gravity should\r\nassociate a portion of her leisure with that of his fair and dear child.\r\n\n\r\nThat other self-elected judge of mine, the professor in the Rue Fossette,\r\ndiscovering by some surreptitious spying means, that I was no longer so\r\nstationary as hitherto, but went out regularly at certain hours of certain\r\ndays, took it upon himself to place me under surveillance. People said M.\r\nEmanuel had been brought up amongst Jesuits. I should more readily have\r\naccredited this report had his man\u0153uvres been better masked. As it was, I\r\ndoubted it. Never was a more undisguised schemer, a franker, looser intriguer.\r\nHe would analyze his own machinations: elaborately contrive plots, and\r\nforthwith indulge in explanatory boasts of their skill. I know not whether I\r\nwas more amused or provoked, by his stepping up to me one morning and\r\nwhispering solemnly that he \u201chad his eye on me: he at least would\r\ndischarge the duty of a friend, and not leave me entirely to my own devices. My\r\nproceedings seemed at present very unsettled: he did not know what to make of\r\nthem: he thought his cousin Beck very much to blame in suffering this sort of\r\nfluttering inconsistency in a teacher attached to her house. What had a person\r\ndevoted to a serious calling, that of education, to do with Counts and\r\nCountesses, hotels and ch\u00e2teaux? To him, I seemed altogether \u2018en l\u2019air.\u2019 On his\r\nfaith, he believed I went out six days in the seven.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI said, \u201cMonsieur exaggerated. I certainly had enjoyed the advantage of a\r\nlittle change lately, but not before it had become necessary; and the privilege\r\nwas by no means exercised in excess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNecessary! How was it necessary? I was well enough, he supposed? Change\r\nnecessary! He would recommend me to look at the Catholic \u2018religieuses,\u2019 and\r\nstudy their lives. They asked no change.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI am no judge of what expression crossed my face when he thus spoke, but it was\r\none which provoked him: he accused me of being reckless, worldly, and\r\nepicurean; ambitious of greatness, and feverishly athirst for the pomps and\r\nvanities of life. It seems I had no \u201cd\u00e9vouement,\u201d no \u201cr\u00e9cueillement\u201d in my\r\ncharacter; no spirit of grace, faith, sacrifice, or self-abasement. Feeling the\r\ninutility of answering these charges, I mutely continued the correction of a\r\npile of English exercises.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe could see in me nothing Christian: like many other Protestants, I revelled\r\nin the pride and self-will of paganism.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI slightly turned from him, nestling still closer under the wing of silence.\r\n\n\r\nA vague sound grumbled between his teeth; it could not surely be a \u201cjuron:\u201d he\r\nwas too religious for that; but I am certain I heard the word sacr\u00e9.\r\nGrievous to relate, the same word was repeated, with the unequivocal addition\r\nof mille something, when I passed him about two hours afterwards in the\r\ncorridor, prepared to go and take my German lesson in the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. Never was\r\na better little man, in some points, than M. Paul: never, in others, a more\r\nwaspish little despot.\r\n\n\r\nOur German mistress, Fr\u00e4ulein Anna Braun, was a worthy, hearty woman, of about\r\nforty-five; she ought, perhaps, to have lived in the days of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nas she habitually consumed, for her first and second breakfasts, beer and beef:\r\nalso, her direct and downright Deutsch nature seemed to suffer a sensation of\r\ncruel restraint from what she called our English reserve; though we thought we\r\nwere very cordial with her: but we did not slap her on the shoulder, and if we\r\nconsented to kiss her cheek, it was done quietly, and without any explosive\r\nsmack. These omissions oppressed and depressed her considerably; still, on the\r\nwhole, we got on very well. Accustomed to instruct foreign girls, who hardly\r\never will think and study for themselves\u2014who have no idea of grappling with a\r\ndifficulty, and overcoming it by dint of reflection or application\u2014our\r\nprogress, which in truth was very leisurely, seemed to astound her. In her\r\neyes, we were a pair of glacial prodigies, cold, proud, and preternatural.\r\n\n\r\nThe young Countess was a little proud, a little fastidious: and perhaps,\r\nwith her native delicacy and beauty, she had a right to these feelings; but I\r\nthink it was a total mistake to ascribe them to me. I never evaded the morning\r\nsalute, which Paulina would slip when she could; nor was a certain little\r\nmanner of still disdain a weapon known in my armoury of defence; whereas,\r\nPaulina always kept it clear, fine, and bright, and any rough German sally\r\ncalled forth at once its steelly glisten.\r\n\n\r\nHonest Anna Braun, in some measure, felt this difference; and while she\r\nhalf-feared, half-worshipped Paulina, as a sort of dainty nymph\u2014an Undine\u2014she\r\ntook refuge with me, as a being all mortal, and of easier mood.\r\n\n\r\nA book we liked well to read and translate was Schiller\u2019s Ballads; Paulina soon\r\nlearned to read them beautifully; the Fr\u00e4ulein would listen to her with a broad\r\nsmile of pleasure, and say her voice sounded like music. She translated them,\r\ntoo, with a facile flow of language, and in a strain of kindred and poetic\r\nfervour: her cheek would flush, her lips tremblingly smile, her beauteous eyes\r\nkindle or melt as she went on. She learnt the best by heart, and would often\r\nrecite them when we were alone together. One she liked well was \u201cDes M\u00e4dchens\r\nKlage:\u201d that is, she liked well to repeat the words, she found plaintive melody\r\nin the sound; the sense she would criticise. She murmured, as we sat over the\r\nfire one evening:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nDu Heilige, rufe dein Kind zur\u00fcck,\r\nIch habe genossen das irdische Gl\u00fcck,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ich habe gelebt und geliebet!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLived and loved!\u201d said she, \u201cis that the summit of earthly happiness, the end\r\nof life\u2014to love? I don\u2019t think it is. It may be the extreme of mortal misery,\r\nit may be sheer waste of time, and fruitless torture of feeling. If Schiller\r\nhad said to be loved, he might have come nearer the truth. Is not that\r\nanother thing, Lucy, to be loved?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it may be: but why consider the subject? What is love to you? What\r\ndo you know about it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe crimsoned, half in irritation, half in shame.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Lucy,\u201d she said, \u201cI won\u2019t take that from you. It may be well for papa to\r\nlook on me as a baby: I rather prefer that he should thus view me; but\r\nyou know and shall learn to acknowledge that I am verging on my\r\nnineteenth year.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo matter if it were your twenty-ninth; we will anticipate no feelings by\r\ndiscussion and conversation; we will not talk about love.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed!\u201d said she\u2014all in hurry and heat\u2014\u201cyou may think to check and\r\nhold me in, as much as you please; but I have talked about it, and heard\r\nabout it too; and a great deal and lately, and disagreeably and detrimentally:\r\nand in a way you wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the vexed, triumphant, pretty, naughty being laughed. I could not discern\r\nwhat she meant, and I would not ask her: I was nonplussed. Seeing, however, the\r\nutmost innocence in her countenance\u2014combined with some transient perverseness\r\nand petulance\u2014I said at last,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on such matters? Who that has\r\nnear access to you would dare to do it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d replied she more softly, \u201cit is a person who makes me miserable\r\nsometimes; and I wish she would keep away\u2014I don\u2019t want her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut who, Paulina, can it be? You puzzle me much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is\u2014it is my cousin Ginevra. Every time she has leave to visit Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley she calls here, and whenever she finds me alone she begins to talk\r\nabout her admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear all she has to say about\r\nlove.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard it,\u201d said I, quite coolly; \u201cand on the whole, perhaps it is\r\nas well you should have heard it too: it is not to be regretted, it is all\r\nright. Yet, surely, Ginevra\u2019s mind cannot influence yours. You can look over\r\nboth her head and her heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe does influence me very much. She has the art of disturbing my happiness\r\nand unsettling my opinions. She hurts me through the feelings and people\r\ndearest to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat does she say, Paulina? Give me some idea. There may be counteraction of\r\nthe damage done.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe people I have longest and most esteemed are degraded by her. She does not\r\nspare Mrs. Bretton\u2014she does not spare\u2026. Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, I daresay: and how does she mix up these with her sentiment and\r\nher\u2026.love? She does mix them, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, she is insolent; and, I believe, false. You know Dr. Bretton. We both\r\nknow him. He may be careless and proud; but when was he ever mean or slavish?\r\nDay after day she shows him to me kneeling at her feet, pursuing her like her\r\nshadow. She\u2014repulsing him with insult, and he imploring her with infatuation.\r\nLucy, is it true? Is any of it true?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt may be true that he once thought her handsome: does she give him out as\r\nstill her suitor?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe says she might marry him any day: he only waits her consent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is these tales which have caused that reserve in your manner towards Graham\r\nwhich your father noticed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have certainly made me all doubtful about his character. As Ginevra\r\nspeaks, they do not carry with them the sound of unmixed truth: I believe she\r\nexaggerates\u2014perhaps invents\u2014but I want to know how far.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we bring Miss Fanshawe to some proof. Give her an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying the power she boasts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could do that to-morrow. Papa has asked some gentlemen to dinner, all\r\nsavants. Graham, who, papa is beginning to discover, is a savant, too\u2014skilled,\r\nthey say, in more than one branch of science\u2014is among the number. Now I should\r\nbe miserable to sit at table unsupported, amidst such a party. I could not talk\r\nto Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and Z\u2014\u2014, the Parisian Academicians: all my new credit for\r\nmanner would be put in peril. You and Mrs. Bretton must come for my sake;\r\nGinevra, at a word, will join you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; then I will carry a message of invitation, and she shall have the chance\r\nof justifying her character for veracity.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"28": "\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nTHE H\u00d4TEL CR\u00c9CY.\n\r\nThe morrow turned out a more lively and busy day than we\u2014or than I, at\r\nleast\u2014had anticipated. It seems it was the birthday of one of the young princes\r\nof Labassecour\u2014the eldest, I think, the Duc de Dindonneau, and a general\r\nholiday was given in his honour at the schools, and especially at the principal\r\n\u201cAth\u00e9n\u00e9e,\u201d or college. The youth of that institution had also concocted, and\r\nwere to present a loyal address; for which purpose they were to be assembled in\r\nthe public building where the yearly examinations were conducted, and the\r\nprizes distributed. After the ceremony of presentation, an oration, or\r\n\u201cdiscours,\u201d was to follow from one of the professors.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral of M. de Bassompierre\u2019s friends\u2014the savants\u2014being more or less\r\nconnected with the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, they were expected to attend on this occasion;\r\ntogether with the worshipful municipality of Villette, M. le Chevalier Staas,\r\nthe burgomaster, and the parents and kinsfolk of the Athenians in general. M.\r\nde Bassompierre was engaged by his friends to accompany them; his fair daughter\r\nwould, of course, be of the party, and she wrote a little note to Ginevra and\r\nmyself, bidding us come early that we might join her.\r\n\n\r\nAs Miss Fanshawe and I were dressing in the dormitory of the Rue Fossette, she\r\n(Miss F.) suddenly burst into a laugh.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked; for she had suspended the operation of arranging her\r\nattire, and was gazing at me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so odd,\u201d she replied, with her usual half-honest half-insolent\r\nunreserve, \u201cthat you and I should now be so much on a level, visiting in the\r\nsame sphere; having the same connections.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said I; \u201cI had not much respect for the connections you chiefly\r\nfrequented awhile ago: Mrs. Cholmondeley and Co. would never have suited me at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, Miss Snowe?\u201d she inquired, in a tone of such undisguised\r\nand unsophisticated curiosity, as made me laugh in my turn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou used to call yourself a nursery governess; when you first came here you\r\nreally had the care of the children in this house: I have seen you carry little\r\nGeorgette in your arms, like a bonne\u2014few governesses would have condescended so\r\nfar\u2014and now Madame Beck treats you with more courtesy than she treats the\r\nParisienne, St. Pierre; and that proud chit, my cousin, makes you her bosom\r\nfriend!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d I agreed, much amused at her mystification. \u201cWho am I indeed?\r\nPerhaps a personage in disguise. Pity I don\u2019t look the character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder you are not more flattered by all this,\u201d she went on; \u201cyou take it\r\nwith strange composure. If you really are the nobody I once thought you, you\r\nmust be a cool hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe nobody you once thought me!\u201d I repeated, and my face grew a little hot;\r\nbut I would not be angry: of what importance was a school-girl\u2019s crude use of\r\nthe terms nobody and somebody? I confined myself, therefore, to the remark that\r\nI had merely met with civility; and asked \u201cwhat she saw in civility to throw\r\nthe recipient into a fever of confusion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne can\u2019t help wondering at some things,\u201d she persisted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWondering at marvels of your own manufacture. Are you ready at last?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; let me take your arm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI would rather not: we will walk side by side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen she took my arm, she always leaned upon me her whole weight; and, as I was\r\nnot a gentleman, or her lover, I did not like it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere, again!\u201d she cried. \u201cI thought, by offering to take your arm, to\r\nintimate approbation of your dress and general appearance: I meant it as a\r\ncompliment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did? You meant, in short, to express that you are not ashamed to be seen\r\nin the street with me? That if Mrs. Cholmondeley should be fondling her lapdog\r\nat some window, or Colonel de Hamal picking his teeth in a balcony, and should\r\ncatch a glimpse of us, you would not quite blush for your companion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said she, with that directness which was her best point\u2014which gave an\r\nhonest plainness to her very fibs when she told them\u2014which was, in short, the\r\nsalt, the sole preservative ingredient of a character otherwise not formed to\r\nkeep.\r\n\n\r\nI delegated the trouble of commenting on this \u201cyes\u201d to my countenance; or\r\nrather, my under-lip voluntarily anticipated my tongue of course, reverence and\r\nsolemnity were not the feelings expressed in the look I gave her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScornful, sneering creature!\u201d she went on, as we crossed a great square, and\r\nentered the quiet, pleasant park, our nearest way to the Rue Cr\u00e9cy. \u201cNobody in\r\nthis world was ever such a Turk to me as you are!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou bring it on yourself: let me alone: have the sense to be quiet: I will let\r\nyou alone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs if one could let you alone, when you are so peculiar and so\r\nmysterious!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe mystery and peculiarity being entirely the conception of your own\r\nbrain\u2014maggots\u2014neither more nor less, be so good as to keep them out of my\r\nsight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut are you anybody?\u201d persevered she, pushing her hand, in spite of me,\r\nunder my arm; and that arm pressed itself with inhospitable closeness against\r\nmy side, by way of keeping out the intruder.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI am a rising character: once an old lady\u2019s companion, then a\r\nnursery-governess, now a school-teacher.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo\u2014do tell me who you are? I\u2019ll not repeat it,\u201d she urged, adhering\r\nwith ludicrous tenacity to the wise notion of an incognito she had got hold of;\r\nand she squeezed the arm of which she had now obtained full possession, and\r\ncoaxed and conjured till I was obliged to pause in the park to laugh.\r\nThroughout our walk she rang the most fanciful changes on this theme; proving,\r\nby her obstinate credulity, or incredulity, her incapacity to conceive how any\r\nperson not bolstered up by birth or wealth, not supported by some consciousness\r\nof name or connection, could maintain an attitude of reasonable integrity. As\r\nfor me, it quite sufficed to my mental tranquillity that I was known where it\r\nimported that known I should be; the rest sat on me easily: pedigree, social\r\nposition, and recondite intellectual acquisition, occupied about the same space\r\nand place in my interests and thoughts; they were my third-class lodgers\u2014to\r\nwhom could be assigned only the small sitting-room and the little back bedroom:\r\neven if the dining and drawing-rooms stood empty, I never confessed it to them,\r\nas thinking minor accommodations better suited to their circumstances. The\r\nworld, I soon learned, held a different estimate: and I make no doubt, the\r\nworld is very right in its view, yet believe also that I am not quite wrong in\r\nmine.\r\n\n\r\nThere are people whom a lowered position degrades morally, to whom loss of\r\nconnection costs loss of self-respect: are not these justified in placing the\r\nhighest value on that station and association which is their safeguard from\r\ndebasement? If a man feels that he would become contemptible in his own eyes\r\nwere it generally known that his ancestry were simple and not gentle, poor and\r\nnot rich, workers and not capitalists, would it be right severely to blame him\r\nfor keeping these fatal facts out of sight\u2014for starting, trembling, quailing at\r\nthe chance which threatens exposure? The longer we live, the more our\r\nexperience widens; the less prone are we to judge our neighbour\u2019s conduct, to\r\nquestion the world\u2019s wisdom: wherever an accumulation of small defences is\r\nfound, whether surrounding the prude\u2019s virtue or the man of the world\u2019s\r\nrespectability, there, be sure, it is needed.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy; Paulina was ready; Mrs. Bretton was with her; and,\r\nunder her escort and that of M. de Bassompierre, we were soon conducted to the\r\nplace of assembly, and seated in good seats, at a convenient distance from the\r\nTribune. The youth of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e were marshalled before us, the municipality\r\nand their bourgmestre were in places of honour, the young princes, with their\r\ntutors, occupied a conspicuous position, and the body of the building was\r\ncrowded with the aristocracy and first burghers of the town.\r\n\n\r\nConcerning the identity of the professor by whom the \u201cdiscours\u201d was to be\r\ndelivered, I had as yet entertained neither care nor question. Some vague\r\nexpectation I had that a savant would stand up and deliver a formal speech,\r\nhalf dogmatism to the Athenians, half flattery to the princes.\r\n\n\r\nThe Tribune was yet empty when we entered, but in ten minutes after it was\r\nfilled; suddenly, in a second of time, a head, chest, and arms grew above the\r\ncrimson desk. This head I knew: its colour, shape, port, expression, were\r\nfamiliar both to me and Miss Fanshawe; the blackness and closeness of cranium,\r\nthe amplitude and paleness of brow, the blueness and fire of glance, were\r\ndetails so domesticated in the memory, and so knit with many a whimsical\r\nassociation, as almost by this their sudden apparition, to tickle fancy to a\r\nlaugh. Indeed, I confess, for my part, I did laugh till I was warm; but then I\r\nbent my head, and made my handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants\r\nof my mirth.\r\n\n\r\nI think I was glad to see M. Paul; I think it was rather pleasant than\r\notherwise, to behold him set up there, fierce and frank, dark and candid, testy\r\nand fearless, as when regnant on his estrade in class. His presence was such a\r\nsurprise: I had not once thought of expecting him, though I knew he filled the\r\nchair of Belles Lettres in the college. With him in that Tribune, I felt\r\nsure that neither formalism nor flattery would be our doom; but for what was\r\nvouchsafed us, for what was poured suddenly, rapidly, continuously, on our\r\nheads\u2014I own I was not prepared.\r\n\n\r\nHe spoke to the princes, the nobles, the magistrates, and the burghers, with\r\njust the same ease, with almost the same pointed, choleric earnestness, with\r\nwhich he was wont to harangue the three divisions of the Rue Fossette. The\r\ncollegians he addressed, not as schoolboys, but as future citizens and embryo\r\npatriots. The times which have since come on Europe had not been foretold yet,\r\nand M. Emanuel\u2019s spirit seemed new to me. Who would have thought the flat and\r\nfat soil of Labassecour could yield political convictions and national\r\nfeelings, such as were now strongly expressed? Of the bearing of his opinions I\r\nneed here give no special indication; yet it may be permitted me to say that I\r\nbelieved the little man not more earnest than right in what he said: with all\r\nhis fire he was severe and sensible; he trampled Utopian theories under his\r\nheel; he rejected wild dreams with scorn;\u2014but when he looked in the face of\r\ntyranny\u2014oh, then there opened a light in his eye worth seeing; and when he\r\nspoke of injustice, his voice gave no uncertain sound, but reminded me rather\r\nof the band-trumpet, ringing at twilight from the park.\r\n\n\r\nI do not think his audience were generally susceptible of sharing his flame in\r\nits purity; but some of the college youth caught fire as he eloquently told\r\nthem what should be their path and endeavour in their country\u2019s and in Europe\u2019s\r\nfuture. They gave him a long, loud, ringing cheer, as he concluded: with all\r\nhis fierceness, he was their favourite professor.\r\n\n\r\nAs our party left the Hall, he stood at the entrance; he saw and knew me, and\r\nlifted his hat; he offered his hand in passing, and uttered the words \u201cQu\u2019en\r\ndites vous?\u201d\u2014question eminently characteristic, and reminding me, even in this\r\nhis moment of triumph, of that inquisitive restlessness, that absence of what I\r\nconsidered desirable self-control, which were amongst his faults. He should not\r\nhave cared just then to ask what I thought, or what anybody thought, but he\r\ndid care, and he was too natural to conceal, too impulsive to repress\r\nhis wish. Well! if I blamed his over-eagerness, I liked his naivet\u00e9. I\r\nwould have praised him: I had plenty of praise in my heart; but, alas! no words\r\non my lips. Who has words at the right moment? I stammered some lame\r\nexpressions; but was truly glad when other people, coming up with profuse\r\ncongratulations, covered my deficiency by their redundancy.\r\n\n\r\nA gentleman introduced him to M. de Bassompierre; and the Count, who had\r\nlikewise been highly gratified, asked him to join his friends (for the most\r\npart M. Emanuel\u2019s likewise), and to dine with them at the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy. He\r\ndeclined dinner, for he was a man always somewhat shy at meeting the advances\r\nof the wealthy: there was a strength of sturdy independence in the stringing of\r\nhis sinews\u2014not obtrusive, but pleasant enough to discover as one advanced in\r\nknowledge of his character; he promised, however, to step in with his friend,\r\nM. A\u2014\u2014, a French Academician, in the course of the evening.\r\n\n\r\nAt dinner that day, Ginevra and Paulina each looked, in her own way, very\r\nbeautiful; the former, perhaps, boasted the advantage in material charms, but\r\nthe latter shone pre-eminent for attractions more subtle and spiritual: for\r\nlight and eloquence of eye, for grace of mien, for winning variety of\r\nexpression. Ginevra\u2019s dress of deep crimson relieved well her light curls, and\r\nharmonized with her rose-like bloom. Paulina\u2019s attire\u2014in fashion close, though\r\nfaultlessly neat, but in texture clear and white\u2014made the eye grateful for the\r\ndelicate life of her complexion, for the soft animation of her countenance, for\r\nthe tender depth of her eyes, for the brown shadow and bounteous flow of her\r\nhair\u2014darker than that of her Saxon cousin, as were also her eyebrows, her\r\neyelashes, her full irids, and large mobile pupils. Nature having traced all\r\nthese details slightly, and with a careless hand, in Miss Fanshawe\u2019s case; and\r\nin Miss de Bassompierre\u2019s, wrought them to a high and delicate finish.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina was awed by the savants, but not quite to mutism: she conversed\r\nmodestly, diffidently; not without effort, but with so true a sweetness, so\r\nfine and penetrating a sense, that her father more than once suspended his own\r\ndiscourse to listen, and fixed on her an eye of proud delight. It was a polite\r\nFrenchman, M. Z\u2014\u2014, a very learned, but quite a courtly man, who had drawn her\r\ninto discourse. I was charmed with her French; it was faultless\u2014the structure\r\ncorrect, the idioms true, the accent pure; Ginevra, who had lived half her life\r\non the Continent, could do nothing like it not that words ever failed Miss\r\nFanshawe, but real accuracy and purity she neither possessed, nor in any number\r\nof years would acquire. Here, too, M. de Bassompierre was gratified; for, on\r\nthe point of language, he was critical.\r\n\n\r\nAnother listener and observer there was; one who, detained by some exigency of\r\nhis profession, had come in late to dinner. Both ladies were quietly scanned by\r\nDr. Bretton, at the moment of taking his seat at the table; and that guarded\r\nsurvey was more than once renewed. His arrival roused Miss Fanshawe, who had\r\nhitherto appeared listless: she now became smiling and complacent,\r\ntalked\u2014though what she said was rarely to the purpose\u2014or rather, was of a\r\npurpose somewhat mortifyingly below the standard of the occasion. Her light,\r\ndisconnected prattle might have gratified Graham once; perhaps it pleased him\r\nstill: perhaps it was only fancy which suggested the thought that, while his\r\neye was filled and his ear fed, his taste, his keen zest, his lively\r\nintelligence, were not equally consulted and regaled. It is certain that,\r\nrestless and exacting as seemed the demand on his attention, he yielded\r\ncourteously all that was required: his manner showed neither pique nor\r\ncoolness: Ginevra was his neighbour, and to her, during dinner, he almost\r\nexclusively confined his notice. She appeared satisfied, and passed to the\r\ndrawing-room in very good spirits.\r\n\n\r\nYet, no sooner had we reached that place of refuge, than she again became flat\r\nand listless: throwing herself on a couch, she denounced both the \u201cdiscours\u201d\r\nand the dinner as stupid affairs, and inquired of her cousin how she could hear\r\nsuch a set of prosaic \u201cgros-bonnets\u201d as her father gathered about him. The\r\nmoment the gentlemen were heard to move, her railings ceased: she started up,\r\nflew to the piano, and dashed at it with spirit. Dr. Bretton entering, one of\r\nthe first, took up his station beside her. I thought he would not long maintain\r\nthat post: there was a position near the hearth to which I expected to see him\r\nattracted: this position he only scanned with his eye; while he looked,\r\nothers drew in. The grace and mind of Paulina charmed these thoughtful\r\nFrenchmen: the fineness of her beauty, the soft courtesy of her manner, her\r\nimmature, but real and inbred tact, pleased their national taste; they\r\nclustered about her, not indeed to talk science; which would have rendered her\r\ndumb, but to touch on many subjects in letters, in arts, in actual life, on\r\nwhich it soon appeared that she had both read and reflected. I listened. I am\r\nsure that though Graham stood aloof, he listened too: his hearing as well as\r\nhis vision was very fine, quick, discriminating. I knew he gathered the\r\nconversation; I felt that the mode in which it was sustained suited him\r\nexquisitely\u2014pleased him almost to pain.\r\n\n\r\nIn Paulina there was more force, both of feeling and character; than most\r\npeople thought\u2014than Graham himself imagined\u2014than she would ever show to those\r\nwho did not wish to see it. To speak truth, reader, there is no excellent\r\nbeauty, no accomplished grace, no reliable refinement, without strength as\r\nexcellent, as complete, as trustworthy. As well might you look for good fruit\r\nand blossom on a rootless and sapless tree, as for charms that will endure in a\r\nfeeble and relaxed nature. For a little while, the blooming semblance of beauty\r\nmay flourish round weakness; but it cannot bear a blast: it soon fades, even in\r\nserenest sunshine. Graham would have started had any suggestive spirit\r\nwhispered of the sinew and the stamina sustaining that delicate nature; but I\r\nwho had known her as a child, knew or guessed by what a good and strong root\r\nher graces held to the firm soil of reality.\r\n\n\r\nWhile Dr. Bretton listened, and waited an opening in the magic circle, his\r\nglance restlessly sweeping the room at intervals, lighted by chance on me,\r\nwhere I sat in a quiet nook not far from my godmother and M. de Bassompierre,\r\nwho, as usual, were engaged in what Mr. Home called \u201ca two-handed crack:\u201d what\r\nthe Count would have interpreted as a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Graham smiled recognition,\r\ncrossed the room, asked me how I was, told me I looked pale. I also had my own\r\nsmile at my own thought: it was now about three months since Dr. John had\r\nspoken to me\u2014a lapse of which he was not even conscious. He sat down, and\r\nbecame silent. His wish was rather to look than converse. Ginevra and Paulina\r\nwere now opposite to him: he could gaze his fill: he surveyed both\r\nforms\u2014studied both faces.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral new guests, ladies as well as gentlemen, had entered the room since\r\ndinner, dropping in for the evening conversation; and amongst the gentlemen, I\r\nmay incidentally observe, I had already noticed by glimpses, a severe, dark,\r\nprofessorial outline, hovering aloof in an inner saloon, seen only in vista. M.\r\nEmanuel knew many of the gentlemen present, but I think was a stranger to most\r\nof the ladies, excepting myself; in looking towards the hearth, he could not\r\nbut see me, and naturally made a movement to approach; seeing, however, Dr.\r\nBretton also, he changed his mind and held back. If that had been all, there\r\nwould have been no cause for quarrel; but not satisfied with holding back, he\r\npuckered up his eyebrows, protruded his lip, and looked so ugly that I averted\r\nmy eyes from the displeasing spectacle. M. Joseph Emanuel had arrived, as well\r\nas his austere brother, and at this very moment was relieving Ginevra at the\r\npiano. What a master-touch succeeded her school-girl jingle! In what grand,\r\ngrateful tones the instrument acknowledged the hand of the true artist!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d began Dr. Bretton, breaking silence and smiling, as Ginevra glided\r\nbefore him, casting a glance as she passed by, \u201cMiss Fanshawe is certainly a\r\nfine girl.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course I assented.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there,\u201d he pursued, \u201canother in the room as lovely?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think there is not another as handsome.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you, Lucy: you and I do often agree in opinion, in taste, I\r\nthink; or at least in judgment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo we?\u201d I said, somewhat doubtfully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl\u2014my mother\u2019s god-son\r\ninstead of her god-daughter, we should have been good friends: our opinions\r\nwould have melted into each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe had assumed a bantering air: a light, half-caressing, half-ironic, shone\r\naslant in his eye. Ah, Graham! I have given more than one solitary moment to\r\nthoughts and calculations of your estimate of Lucy Snowe: was it always kind or\r\njust? Had Lucy been intrinsically the same but possessing the additional\r\nadvantages of wealth and station, would your manner to her, your value for her,\r\nhave been quite what they actually were? And yet by these questions I would not\r\nseriously infer blame. No; you might sadden and trouble me sometimes; but then\r\nmine was a soon-depressed, an easily-deranged temperament\u2014it fell if a cloud\r\ncrossed the sun. Perhaps before the eye of severe equity I should stand more at\r\nfault than you.\r\n\n\r\nTrying, then, to keep down the unreasonable pain which thrilled my heart, on\r\nthus being made to feel that while Graham could devote to others the most grave\r\nand earnest, the manliest interest, he had no more than light raillery for\r\nLucy, the friend of lang syne, I inquired calmly,\u2014\u201cOn what points are we so\r\nclosely in accordance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe each have an observant faculty. You, perhaps, don\u2019t give me credit for the\r\npossession; yet I have it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you were speaking of tastes: we may see the same objects, yet estimate\r\nthem differently?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet us bring it to the test. Of course, you cannot but render homage to the\r\nmerits of Miss Fanshawe: now, what do you think of others in the room?\u2014my\r\nmother, for instance; or the lions yonder, Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and Z\u2014\u2014; or, let us\r\nsay, that pale little lady, Miss de Bassompierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know what I think of your mother. I have not thought of Messieurs A\u2014\u2014 and\r\nZ\u2014\u2014.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the other?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think she is, as you say, a pale little lady\u2014pale, certainly, just now, when\r\nshe is fatigued with over-excitement.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember her as a child?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder, sometimes, whether you do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had forgotten her; but it is noticeable, that circumstances, persons, even\r\nwords and looks, that had slipped your memory, may, under certain conditions,\r\ncertain aspects of your own or another\u2019s mind, revive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible enough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe revival is imperfect\u2014needs confirmation, partakes so\r\nmuch of the dim character of a dream, or of the airy one of a fancy, that the\r\ntestimony of a witness becomes necessary for corroboration. Were you not a\r\nguest at Bretton ten years ago, when Mr. Home brought his little girl, whom we\r\nthen called \u2018little Polly,\u2019 to stay with mamma?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was there the night she came, and also the morning she went away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather a peculiar child, was she not? I wonder how I treated her. Was I fond\r\nof children in those days? Was there anything gracious or kindly about\r\nme\u2014great, reckless, schoolboy as I was? But you don\u2019t recollect me, of course?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have seen your own picture at La Terrasse. It is like you personally. In\r\nmanner, you were almost the same yesterday as to-day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Lucy, how is that? Such an oracle really whets my curiosity. What am I\r\nto-day? What was I the yesterday of ten years back?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGracious to whatever pleased you\u2014unkindly or cruel to nothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere you are wrong; I think I was almost a brute to you, for\r\ninstance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA brute! No, Graham: I should never have patiently endured brutality.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis, however, I do remember: quiet Lucy Snowe tasted nothing of\r\nmy grace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs little of your cruelty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, had I been Nero himself, I could not have tormented a being inoffensive\r\nas a shadow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled; but I also hushed a groan. Oh!\u2014I just wished he would let me\r\nalone\u2014cease allusion to me. These epithets\u2014these attributes I put from me. His\r\n\u201cquiet Lucy Snowe,\u201d his \u201cinoffensive shadow,\u201d I gave him back; not with scorn,\r\nbut with extreme weariness: theirs was the coldness and the pressure of lead;\r\nlet him whelm me with no such weight. Happily, he was soon on another theme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn what terms were \u2018little Polly\u2019 and I? Unless my recollections deceive me,\r\nwe were not foes\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou speak very vaguely. Do you think little Polly\u2019s memory, not more\r\ndefinite?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! we don\u2019t talk of \u2018little Polly\u2019 now. Pray say, Miss de\r\nBassompierre; and, of course, such a stately personage remembers nothing of\r\nBretton. Look at her large eyes, Lucy; can they read a word in the page of\r\nmemory? Are they the same which I used to direct to a horn-book? She does not\r\nknow that I partly taught her to read.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the Bible on Sunday nights?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe has a calm, delicate, rather fine profile now: once what a little\r\nrestless, anxious countenance was hers! What a thing is a child\u2019s\r\npreference\u2014what a bubble! Would you believe it? that lady was fond of me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think she was in some measure fond of you,\u201d said I, moderately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember then? I had forgotten; but I remember now.\r\nShe liked me the best of whatever there was at Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI quite well recall it. I wish I could tell her all I recall; or rather, I\r\nwish some one, you for instance, would go behind and whisper it all in her ear,\r\nand I could have the delight\u2014here, as I sit\u2014of watching her look under the\r\nintelligence. Could you manage that, think you, Lucy, and make me ever\r\ngrateful?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould I manage to make you ever grateful?\u201d said I. \u201cNo, I could not.\u201d\r\nAnd I felt my fingers work and my hands interlock: I felt, too, an inward\r\ncourage, warm and resistant. In this matter I was not disposed to gratify Dr.\r\nJohn: not at all. With now welcome force, I realized his entire misapprehension\r\nof my character and nature. He wanted always to give me a role not mine. Nature\r\nand I opposed him. He did not at all guess what I felt: he did not read my\r\neyes, or face, or gestures; though, I doubt not, all spoke. Leaning towards me\r\ncoaxingly, he said, softly, \u201cDo content me, Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I would have contented, or, at least, I would clearly have enlightened him,\r\nand taught him well never again to expect of me the part of officious soubrette\r\nin a love drama; when, following his, soft, eager, murmur, meeting almost his\r\npleading, mellow\u2014\u201cDo content me, Lucy!\u201d a sharp hiss pierced my ear on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite chatte, doucerette, coquette!\u201d sibillated the sudden boa-constrictor;\r\n\u201cvous avez l\u2019air bien triste, soumis, r\u00eaveur, mais vous ne l\u2019\u00eates pas; c\u2019est\r\nmoi qui vous le dis: Sauvage! la flamme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2me, l\u2019\u00e9clair aux yeux!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOui; j\u2019ai la flamme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2me, et je dois l\u2019avoir!\u201d retorted I, turning in just\r\nwrath: but Professor Emanuel had hissed his insult and was gone.\r\n\n\r\nThe worst of the matter was, that Dr. Bretton, whose ears, as I have said, were\r\nquick and fine, caught every word of this apostrophe; he put his handkerchief\r\nto his face, and laughed till he shook.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell done, Lucy,\u201d cried he; \u201ccapital! petite chatte, petite coquette! Oh, I\r\nmust tell my mother! Is it true, Lucy, or half-true? I believe it is: you\r\nredden to the colour of Miss Fanshawe\u2019s gown. And really, by my word, now I\r\nexamine him, that is the same little man who was so savage with you at the\r\nconcert: the very same, and in his soul he is frantic at this moment because he\r\nsees me laughing. Oh! I must tease him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Graham, yielding to his bent for mischief, laughed, jested, and whispered\r\non till I could bear no more, and my eyes filled.\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly he was sobered: a vacant space appeared near Miss de Bassompierre; the\r\ncircle surrounding her seemed about to dissolve. This movement was instantly\r\ncaught by Graham\u2019s eye\u2014ever-vigilant, even while laughing; he rose, took his\r\ncourage in both hands, crossed the room, and made the advantage his own. Dr.\r\nJohn, throughout his whole life, was a man of luck\u2014a man of success. And why?\r\nBecause he had the eye to see his opportunity, the heart to prompt to\r\nwell-timed action, the nerve to consummate a perfect work. And no\r\ntyrant-passion dragged him back; no enthusiasms, no foibles encumbered his way.\r\nHow well he looked at this very moment! When Paulina looked up as he reached\r\nher side, her glance mingled at once with an encountering glance, animated, yet\r\nmodest; his colour, as he spoke to her, became half a blush, half a glow. He\r\nstood in her presence brave and bashful: subdued and unobtrusive, yet decided\r\nin his purpose and devoted in his ardour. I gathered all this by one view. I\r\ndid not prolong my observation\u2014time failed me, had inclination served: the\r\nnight wore late; Ginevra and I ought already to have been in the Rue Fossette.\r\nI rose, and bade good-night to my godmother and M. de Bassompierre.\r\n\n\r\nI know not whether Professor Emanuel had noticed my reluctant acceptance of Dr.\r\nBretton\u2019s badinage, or whether he perceived that I was pained, and that, on the\r\nwhole, the evening had not been one flow of exultant enjoyment for the\r\nvolatile, pleasure-loving Mademoiselle Lucie; but, as I was leaving the room,\r\nhe stepped up and inquired whether I had any one to attend me to the Rue\r\nFossette. The professor now spoke politely, and even deferentially, and\r\nhe looked apologetic and repentant; but I could not recognise his civility at a\r\nword, nor meet his contrition with crude, premature oblivion. Never hitherto\r\nhad I felt seriously disposed to resent his brusqueries, or freeze before his\r\nfierceness; what he had said to-night, however, I considered unwarranted: my\r\nextreme disapprobation of the proceeding must be marked, however slightly. I\r\nmerely said:\u2014\u201cI am provided with attendance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhich was true, as Ginevra and I were to be sent home in the carriage; and I\r\npassed him with the sliding obeisance with which he was wont to be saluted in\r\nclasse by pupils crossing his estrade.\r\n\n\r\nHaving sought my shawl, I returned to the vestibule. M. Emanuel stood there as\r\nif waiting. He observed that the night was fine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d I said, with a tone and manner whose consummate chariness and\r\nfrostiness I could not but applaud. It was so seldom I could properly act out\r\nmy own resolution to be reserved and cool where I had been grieved or hurt,\r\nthat I felt almost proud of this one successful effort. That \u201cIs it?\u201d sounded\r\njust like the manner of other people. I had heard hundreds of such little\r\nminced, docked, dry phrases, from the pursed-up coral lips of a score of\r\nself-possessed, self-sufficing misses and mesdemoiselles. That M. Paul would\r\nnot stand any prolonged experience of this sort of dialogue I knew; but he\r\ncertainly merited a sample of the curt and arid. I believe he thought so\r\nhimself, for he took the dose quietly. He looked at my shawl and objected to\r\nits lightness. I decidedly told him it was as heavy as I wished. Receding\r\naloof, and standing apart, I leaned on the banister of the stairs, folded my\r\nshawl about me, and fixed my eyes on a dreary religious painting darkening the\r\nwall.\r\n\n\r\nGinevra was long in coming: tedious seemed her loitering. M. Paul was still\r\nthere; my ear expected from his lips an angry tone. He came nearer. \u201cNow for\r\nanother hiss!\u201d thought I: had not the action been too uncivil I could have\r\nstopped my ears with my fingers in terror of the thrill. Nothing happens as we\r\nexpect: listen for a coo or a murmur; it is then you will hear a cry of prey or\r\npain. Await a piercing shriek, an angry threat, and welcome an amicable\r\ngreeting, a low kind whisper. M. Paul spoke gently:\u2014\u201cFriends,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not\r\nquarrel for a word. Tell me, was it I or ce grand fat d\u2019Anglais\u201d (so he\r\nprofanely denominated Dr. Bretton), \u201cwho made your eyes so humid, and your\r\ncheeks so hot as they are even now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not conscious of you, monsieur, or of any other having excited such\r\nemotion as you indicate,\u201d was my answer; and in giving it, I again surpassed my\r\nusual self, and achieved a neat, frosty falsehood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what did I say?\u201d he pursued; \u201ctell me: I was angry: I have forgotten my\r\nwords; what were they?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuch as it is best to forget!\u201d said I, still quite calm and chill.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen it was my words which wounded you? Consider them unsaid: permit my\r\nretractation; accord my pardon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am not angry, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you are worse than angry\u2014grieved. Forgive me, Miss Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. Emanuel, I do forgive you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me hear you say, in the voice natural to you, and not in that alien tone,\r\n\u2018Mon ami, je vous pardonne.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe made me smile. Who could help smiling at his wistfulness, his simplicity,\r\nhis earnestness?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon!\u201d he cried. \u201cVoil\u00e0 que le jour va poindre! Dites donc, mon ami.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Paul, je vous pardonne.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will have no monsieur: speak the other word, or I shall not believe you\r\nsincere: another effort\u2014mon ami, or else in English,\u2014my friend!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, \u201cmy friend\u201d had rather another sound and significancy than \u201cmon\r\nami;\u201d it did not breathe the same sense of domestic and intimate affection;\r\n\u201cmon ami\u201d I could not say to M. Paul; \u201cmy friend,\u201d I could, and\r\ndid say without difficulty. This distinction existed not for him, however, and\r\nhe was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He smiled. You should have seen\r\nhim smile, reader; and you should have marked the difference between his\r\ncountenance now, and that he wore half an hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had\r\never witnessed the smile of pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul\u2019s\r\nlips, or in his eyes before. The ironic, the sarcastic, the disdainful, the\r\npassionately exultant, I had hundreds of times seen him express by what he\r\ncalled a smile, but any illuminated sign of milder or warmer feelings struck me\r\nas wholly new in his visage. It changed it as from a mask to a face: the deep\r\nlines left his features; the very complexion seemed clearer and fresher; that\r\nswart, sallow, southern darkness which spoke his Spanish blood, became\r\ndisplaced by a lighter hue. I know not that I have ever seen in any other human\r\nface an equal metamorphosis from a similar cause. He now took me to the\r\ncarriage: at the same moment M. de Bassompierre came out with his niece.\r\n\n\r\nIn a pretty humour was Mistress Fanshawe; she had found the evening a grand\r\nfailure: completely upset as to temper, she gave way to the most uncontrolled\r\nmoroseness as soon as we were seated, and the carriage-door closed. Her\r\ninvectives against Dr. Bretton had something venomous in them. Having found\r\nherself impotent either to charm or sting him, hatred was her only resource;\r\nand this hatred she expressed in terms so unmeasured and proportion so\r\nmonstrous, that, after listening for a while with assumed stoicism, my outraged\r\nsense of justice at last and suddenly caught fire. An explosion ensued: for I\r\ncould be passionate, too; especially with my present fair but faulty associate,\r\nwho never failed to stir the worst dregs of me. It was well that the\r\ncarriage-wheels made a tremendous rattle over the flinty Choseville pavement,\r\nfor I can assure the reader there was neither dead silence nor calm discussion\r\nwithin the vehicle. Half in earnest, half in seeming, I made it my business to\r\nstorm down Ginevra. She had set out rampant from the Rue Cr\u00e9cy; it was\r\nnecessary to tame her before we reached the Rue Fossette: to this end it was\r\nindispensable to show up her sterling value and high deserts; and this must be\r\ndone in language of which the fidelity and homeliness might challenge\r\ncomparison with the compliments of a John Knox to a Mary Stuart. This was the\r\nright discipline for Ginevra; it suited her. I am quite sure she went to bed\r\nthat night all the better and more settled in mind and mood, and slept all the\r\nmore sweetly for having undergone a sound moral drubbing.\r\n\n"}
{"29": "\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE WATCHGUARD.\n\r\nM. Paul Emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of interruption,\r\nfrom whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: to pass through the classe\r\nunder such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the\r\nschool, individually and collectively, to be as much as a woman\u2019s or girl\u2019s\r\nlife was worth.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise, would \u201cskurry\u201d through,\r\nretrenching her skirts, and carefully coasting the formidable estrade, like a\r\nship dreading breakers. As to Rosine, the portress\u2014on whom, every half-hour,\r\ndevolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the very heart of one or\r\nother of the divisions to take their music-lessons in the oratory, the great or\r\nlittle saloon, the salle-\u00e0-manger, or some other piano-station\u2014she would, upon\r\nher second or third attempt, frequently become almost tongue-tied from excess\r\nof consternation\u2014a sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled at her\r\nthrough a pair of dart-dealing spectacles.\r\n\n\r\nOne morning I was sitting in the carr\u00e9, at work upon a piece of embroidery\r\nwhich one of the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish, and while my\r\nfingers wrought at the frame, my ears regaled themselves with listening to the\r\ncrescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in the neighbouring classe, in\r\ntones that waxed momentarily more unquiet, more ominously varied. There was a\r\ngood strong partition-wall between me and the gathering storm, as well as a\r\nfacile means of flight through the glass-door to the court, in case it swept\r\nthis way; so I am afraid I derived more amusement than alarm from these\r\nthickening symptoms. Poor Rosine was not safe: four times that blessed morning\r\nhad she made the passage of peril; and now, for the fifth time, it became her\r\ndangerous duty to snatch, as it were, a brand from the burning\u2014a pupil from\r\nunder M. Paul\u2019s nose.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\u201d cried she. \u201cQue vais-je devenir? Monsieur va me tuer, je\r\nsuis s\u00fbre; car il est d\u2019une col\u00e8re!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNerved by the courage of desperation, she opened the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle La Malle au piano!\u201d was her cry.\r\n\n\r\nEre she could make good her retreat, or quite close the door, this voice\r\nuttered itself:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u00e8s ce moment!\u2014la classe est d\u00e9fendue. La premi\u00e8re qui ouvrira cette porte, ou\r\npassera par cette division, sera pendue\u2014fut-ce Madame Beck elle-m\u00eame!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTen minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of this decree when Rosine\u2019s\r\nFrench pantoufles were again heard shuffling along the corridor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said she, \u201cI would not for a five-franc piece go into that\r\nclasse again just now: Monsieur\u2019s lunettes are really terrible; and here is a\r\ncommissionaire come with a message from the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e. I have told Madame Beck I\r\ndare not deliver it, and she says I am to charge you with it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMe? No, that is rather too bad! It is not in my line of duty. Come, come,\r\nRosine! bear your own burden. Be brave\u2014charge once more!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI, Mademoiselle?\u2014impossible! Five times I have crossed him this day. Madame\r\nmust really hire a gendarme for this service. Ouf! Je n\u2019en puis plus!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah! you are only a coward. What is the message?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely of the kind with which Monsieur least likes to be pestered: an\r\nurgent summons to go directly to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, as there is an official\r\nvisitor\u2014inspector\u2014I know not what\u2014arrived, and Monsieur must meet him:\r\nyou know how he hates a must.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYes, I knew well enough. The restive little man detested spur or curb: against\r\nwhatever was urgent or obligatory, he was sure to revolt. However, I accepted\r\nthe responsibility\u2014not, certainly, without fear, but fear blent with other\r\nsentiments, curiosity, amongst them. I opened the door, I entered, I closed it\r\nbehind me as quickly and quietly as a rather unsteady hand would permit; for to\r\nbe slow or bustling, to rattle a latch, or leave a door gaping wide, were\r\naggravations of crime often more disastrous in result than the main crime\r\nitself. There I stood then, and there he sat; his humour was visibly bad\u2014almost\r\nat its worst; he had been giving a lesson in arithmetic\u2014for he gave lessons on\r\nany and every subject that struck his fancy\u2014and arithmetic being a dry subject,\r\ninvariably disagreed with him: not a pupil but trembled when he spoke of\r\nfigures. He sat, bent above his desk: to look up at the sound of an entrance,\r\nat the occurrence of a direct breach of his will and law, was an effort he\r\ncould not for the moment bring himself to make. It was quite as well: I thus\r\ngained time to walk up the long classe; and it suited my idiosyncracy far\r\nbetter to encounter the near burst of anger like his, than to bear its menace\r\nat a distance.\r\n\n\r\nAt his estrade I paused, just in front; of course I was not worthy of immediate\r\nattention: he proceeded with his lesson. Disdain would not do: he must hear and\r\nhe must answer my message.\r\n\n\r\nNot being quite tall enough to lift my head over his desk, elevated upon the\r\nestrade, and thus suffering eclipse in my present position, I ventured to peep\r\nround, with the design, at first, of merely getting a better view of his face,\r\nwhich had struck me when I entered as bearing a close and picturesque\r\nresemblance to that of a black and sallow tiger. Twice did I enjoy this\r\nside-view with impunity, advancing and receding unseen; the third time my eye\r\nhad scarce dawned beyond the obscuration of the desk, when it was caught and\r\ntransfixed through its very pupil\u2014transfixed by the \u201clunettes.\u201d Rosine was\r\nright; these utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror, beyond the\r\nmobile wrath of the wearer\u2019s own unglazed eyes.\r\n\n\r\nI now found the advantage of proximity: these short-sighted \u201clunettes\u201d were\r\nuseless for the inspection of a criminal under Monsieur\u2019s nose; accordingly, he\r\ndoffed them, and he and I stood on more equal terms.\r\n\n\r\nI am glad I was not really much afraid of him\u2014that, indeed, close in his\r\npresence, I felt no terror at all; for upon his demanding cord and gibbet to\r\nexecute the sentence recently pronounced, I was able to furnish him with a\r\nneedleful of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility as could not\r\nbut allay some portion at least of his surplus irritation. Of course I did not\r\nparade this courtesy before public view: I merely handed the thread round the\r\nangle of the desk, and attached it, ready noosed, to the barred back of the\r\nProfessor\u2019s chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue me voulez-vous?\u201d said he in a growl of which the music was wholly confined\r\nto his chest and throat, for he kept his teeth clenched; and seemed registering\r\nto himself an inward vow that nothing earthly should wring from him a smile.\r\n\n\r\nMy answer commenced uncompromisingly: \u201cMonsieur,\u201d I said, \u201cje veux\r\nl\u2019impossible, des choses inou\u00efes;\u201d and thinking it best not to mince matters,\r\nbut to administer the \u201cdouche\u201d with decision, in a low but quick voice, I\r\ndelivered the Athenian message, floridly exaggerating its urgency.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, he would not hear a word of it. \u201cHe would not go; he would not leave\r\nhis present class, let all the officials of Villette send for him. He would not\r\nput himself an inch out of his way at the bidding of king, cabinet, and\r\nchambers together.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knew, however, that he must go; that, talk as he would, both his duty\r\nand interest commanded an immediate and literal compliance with the summons: I\r\nstood, therefore, waiting in silence, as if he had not yet spoken. He asked\r\nwhat more I wanted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly Monsieur\u2019s answer to deliver to the commissionaire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe waved an impatient negative.\r\n\n\r\nI ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnet-grec which lay in grim repose on\r\nthe window-sill. He followed this daring movement with his eye, no doubt in\r\nmixed pity and amazement at its presumption.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d he muttered, \u201cif it came to that\u2014if Miss Lucy meddled with his\r\nbonnet-grec\u2014she might just put it on herself, turn gar\u00e7on for the occasion, and\r\nbenevolently go to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in his stead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith great respect, I laid the bonnet on the desk, where its tassel seemed to\r\ngive me an awful nod.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll write a note of apology\u2014that will do!\u201d said he, still bent on evasion.\r\n\n\r\nKnowing well it would not do, I gently pushed the bonnet towards his\r\nhand. Thus impelled, it slid down the polished slope of the varnished and\r\nunbaized desk, carried before it the light steel-framed \u201clunettes,\u201d and,\r\nfearful to relate, they fell to the estrade. A score of times ere now had I\r\nseen them fall and receive no damage\u2014this time, as Lucy Snowe\u2019s hapless\r\nluck would have it, they so fell that each clear pebble became a shivered and\r\nshapeless star.\r\n\n\r\nNow, indeed, dismay seized me\u2014dismay and regret. I knew the value of these\r\n\u201clunettes\u201d: M. Paul\u2019s sight was peculiar, not easily fitted, and these glasses\r\nsuited him. I had heard him call them his treasures: as I picked them up,\r\ncracked and worthless, my hand trembled. Frightened through all my nerves I was\r\nto see the mischief I had done, but I think I was even more sorry than afraid.\r\nFor some seconds I dared not look the bereaved Professor in the face; he was\r\nthe first to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cL\u00e0!\u201d said he: \u201cme voil\u00e0 veuf de mes lunettes! I think Mademoiselle Lucy will\r\nnow confess that the cord and gallows are amply earned; she trembles in\r\nanticipation of her doom. Ah, traitress! traitress! You are resolved to have me\r\nquite blind and helpless in your hands!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI lifted my eyes: his face, instead of being irate, lowering, and furrowed, was\r\noverflowing with the smile, coloured with the bloom I had seen brightening it\r\nthat evening at the Hotel Cr\u00e9cy. He was not angry\u2014not even grieved. For the\r\nreal injury he showed himself full of clemency; under the real provocation,\r\npatient as a saint. This event, which seemed so untoward\u2014which I thought had\r\nruined at once my chance of successful persuasion\u2014proved my best help.\r\nDifficult of management so long as I had done him no harm, he became graciously\r\npliant as soon as I stood in his presence a conscious and contrite offender.\r\n\n\r\nStill gently railing at me as \u201cune forte femme\u2014une Anglaise terrible\u2014une petite\r\ncasse-tout\u201d\u2014he declared that he dared not but obey one who had given such an\r\ninstance of her dangerous prowess; it was absolutely like the \u201cgrand Empereur\r\nsmashing the vase to inspire dismay.\u201d So, at last, crowning himself with his\r\nbonnet-grec, and taking his ruined \u201clunettes\u201d from my hand with a clasp of kind\r\npardon and encouragement, he made his bow, and went off to the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in\r\nfirst-rate humour and spirits.\r\n\n\r\nAfter all this amiability, the reader will be sorry for my sake to hear that I\r\nwas quarrelling with M. Paul again before night; yet so it was, and I could not\r\nhelp it.\r\n\n\r\nIt was his occasional custom\u2014and a very laudable, acceptable custom, too\u2014to\r\narrive of an evening, always \u00e0 l\u2019improviste, unannounced, burst in on the\r\nsilent hour of study, establish a sudden despotism over us and our occupations,\r\ncause books to be put away, work-bags to be brought out, and, drawing forth a\r\nsingle thick volume, or a handful of pamphlets, substitute for the besotted\r\n\u201clecture pieuse,\u201d drawled by a sleepy pupil, some tragedy made grand by grand\r\nreading, ardent by fiery action\u2014some drama, whereof, for my part, I rarely\r\nstudied the intrinsic merit; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring,\r\nand filled it with his native verve and passion like a cup with a vital\r\nbrewage. Or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a\r\nbrighter world, show us a glimpse of the current literature of the day, read us\r\npassages from some enchanting tale, or the last witty feuilleton which had\r\nawakened laughter in the saloons of Paris; taking care always to expunge, with\r\nthe severest hand, whether from tragedy, melodrama, tale, or essay, whatever\r\npassage, phrase, or word, could be deemed unsuited to an audience of \u201cjeunes\r\nfilles.\u201d I noticed more than once, that where retrenchment without substitute\r\nwould have left unmeaning vacancy, or introduced weakness, he could, and did,\r\nimprovise whole paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the\r\ndialogue\u2014the description\u2014he engrafted was often far better than that he pruned\r\naway.\r\n\n\r\nWell, on the evening in question, we were sitting silent as nuns in a\r\n\u201cretreat,\u201d the pupils studying, the teachers working. I remember my work; it\r\nwas a slight matter of fancy, and it rather interested me; it had a purpose; I\r\nwas not doing it merely to kill time; I meant it when finished as a gift; and\r\nthe occasion of presentation being near, haste was requisite, and my fingers\r\nwere busy.\r\n\n\r\nWe heard the sharp bell-peal which we all knew; then the rapid step familiar to\r\neach ear: the words \u201cVoil\u00e0 Monsieur!\u201d had scarcely broken simultaneously from\r\nevery lip, when the two-leaved door split (as split it always did for his\r\nadmission\u2014such a slow word as \u201copen\u201d is inefficient to describe his movements),\r\nand he stood in the midst of us.\r\n\n\r\nThere were two study tables, both long and flanked with benches; over the\r\ncentre of each hung a lamp; beneath this lamp, on either side the table, sat a\r\nteacher; the girls were arranged to the right hand and the left; the eldest and\r\nmost studious nearest the lamps or tropics; the idlers and little ones towards\r\nthe north and south poles. Monsieur\u2019s habit was politely to hand a chair to\r\nsome teacher, generally Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, the senior mistress; then to take her\r\nvacated seat; and thus avail himself of the full beam of Cancer or Capricorn,\r\nwhich, owing to his near sight, he needed.\r\n\n\r\nAs usual, Z\u00e9lie rose with alacrity, smiling to the whole extent of her mouth,\r\nand the full display of her upper and under rows of teeth\u2014that strange smile\r\nwhich passes from ear to ear, and is marked only by a sharp thin curve, which\r\nfails to spread over the countenance, and neither dimples the cheek nor lights\r\nthe eye. I suppose Monsieur did not see her, or he had taken a whim that he\r\nwould not notice her, for he was as capricious as women are said to be; then\r\nhis \u201clunettes\u201d (he had got another pair) served him as an excuse for all sorts\r\nof little oversights and shortcomings. Whatever might be his reason, he passed\r\nby Z\u00e9lie, came to the other side of the table, and before I could start up to\r\nclear the way, whispered, \u201cNe bougez pas,\u201d and established himself between me\r\nand Miss Fanshawe, who always would be my neighbour, and have her elbow in my\r\nside, however often I declared to her, \u201cGinevra, I wish you were at Jericho.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was easy to say, \u201cNe bougez pas;\u201d but how could I help it? I must make him\r\nroom, and I must request the pupils to recede that I might recede. It\r\nwas very well for Ginevra to be gummed to me, \u201ckeeping herself warm,\u201d as she\r\nsaid, on the winter evenings, and harassing my very heart with her fidgetings\r\nand pokings, obliging me, indeed, sometimes to put an artful pin in my girdle\r\nby way of protection against her elbow; but I suppose M. Emanuel was not to be\r\nsubjected to the same kind of treatment, so I swept away my working materials,\r\nto clear space for his book, and withdrew myself to make room for his person;\r\nnot, however, leaving more than a yard of interval, just what any reasonable\r\nman would have regarded as a convenient, respectful allowance of bench. But M.\r\nEmanuel never was reasonable; flint and tinder that he was! he struck\r\nand took fire directly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous ne voulez pas de moi pour voisin,\u201d he growled: \u201cvous vous donnez des airs\r\nde caste; vous me traitez en paria;\u201d he scowled. \u201cSoit! je vais arranger la\r\nchose!\u201d And he set to work.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLevez vous toutes, Mesdemoiselles!\u201d cried he.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls rose. He made them all file off to the other table. He then placed me\r\nat one extremity of the long bench, and having duly and carefully brought me my\r\nwork-basket, silk, scissors, all my implements, he fixed himself quite at the\r\nother end.\r\n\n\r\nAt this arrangement, highly absurd as it was, not a soul in the room dared to\r\nlaugh; luckless for the giggler would have been the giggle. As for me, I took\r\nit with entire coolness. There I sat, isolated and cut off from human\r\nintercourse; I sat and minded my work, and was quiet, and not at all unhappy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst ce assez de distance?\u201d he demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur en est l\u2019arbitre,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVous savez bien que non. C\u2019est vous qui avez cr\u00e9e ce vide immense: moi je n\u2019y\r\nai pas mis la main.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd with this assertion he commenced the reading.\r\n\n\r\nFor his misfortune he had chosen a French translation of what he called \u201cun\r\ndrame de Williams Shackspire; le faux dieu,\u201d he further announced, \u201cde ces sots\r\npa\u00efens, les Anglais.\u201d How far otherwise he would have characterized him had his\r\ntemper not been upset, I scarcely need intimate.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, the translation being French, was very inefficient; nor did I make\r\nany particular effort to conceal the contempt which some of its forlorn lapses\r\nwere calculated to excite. Not that it behoved or beseemed me to say anything:\r\nbut one can occasionally look the opinion it is forbidden to embody in\r\nwords. Monsieur\u2019s lunettes being on the alert, he gleaned up every stray look;\r\nI don\u2019t think he lost one: the consequence was, his eyes soon discarded a\r\nscreen, that their blaze might sparkle free, and he waxed hotter at the north\r\npole to which he had voluntarily exiled himself, than, considering the general\r\ntemperature of the room, it would have been reasonable to become under the\r\nvertical ray of Cancer itself.\r\n\n\r\nThe reading over, it appeared problematic whether he would depart with his\r\nanger unexpressed, or whether he would give it vent. Suppression was not much\r\nin his habits; but still, what had been done to him definite enough to afford\r\nmatter for overt reproof? I had not uttered a sound, and could not justly be\r\ndeemed amenable to reprimand or penalty for having permitted a slightly freer\r\naction than usual to the muscles about my eyes and mouth.\r\n\n\r\nThe supper, consisting of bread, and milk diluted with tepid water, was brought\r\nin. In respectful consideration of the Professor\u2019s presence, the rolls and\r\nglasses were allowed to stand instead of being immediately handed round.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake your supper, ladies,\u201d said he, seeming to be occupied in making marginal\r\nnotes to his \u201cWilliams Shackspire.\u201d They took it. I also accepted a roll and\r\nglass, but being now more than ever interested in my work, I kept my seat of\r\npunishment, and wrought while I munched my bread and sipped my beverage, the\r\nwhole with easy sang-froid; with a certain snugness of composure,\r\nindeed, scarcely in my habits, and pleasantly novel to my feelings. It seemed\r\nas if the presence of a nature so restless, chafing, thorny as that of M. Paul\r\nabsorbed all feverish and unsettling influences like a magnet, and left me none\r\nbut such as were placid and harmonious.\r\n\n\r\nHe rose. \u201cWill he go away without saying another word?\u201d Yes; he turned to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\n\r\nNo: he re-turned on his steps; but only, perhaps, to take his\r\npencil-case, which had been left on the table.\r\n\n\r\nHe took it\u2014shut the pencil in and out, broke its point against the wood, re-cut\r\nand pocketed it, and . . . walked promptly up to me.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls and teachers, gathered round the other table, were talking pretty\r\nfreely: they always talked at meals; and, from the constant habit of speaking\r\nfast and loud at such times, did not now subdue their voices much.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul came and stood behind me. He asked at what I was working; and I said I\r\nwas making a watchguard.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked, \u201cFor whom?\u201d And I answered, \u201cFor a gentleman\u2014one of my friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul stooped down and proceeded\u2014as novel-writers say, and, as was literally\r\ntrue in his case\u2014to \u201chiss\u201d into my ear some poignant words.\r\n\n\r\nHe said that, of all the women he knew, I was the one who could make herself\r\nthe most consummately unpleasant: I was she with whom it was least possible to\r\nlive on friendly terms. I had a \u201ccaract\u00e8re intraitable,\u201d and perverse to a\r\nmiracle. How I managed it, or what possessed me, he, for his part, did not\r\nknow; but with whatever pacific and amicable intentions a person accosted\r\nme\u2014crac! I turned concord to discord, good-will to enmity. He was sure, he\u2014M.\r\nPaul\u2014wished me well enough; he had never done me any harm that he knew of; he\r\nmight, at least, he supposed, claim a right to be regarded as a neutral\r\nacquaintance, guiltless of hostile sentiments: yet, how I behaved to him! With\r\nwhat pungent vivacities\u2014what an impetus of mutiny\u2014what a \u201cfougue\u201d of injustice!\r\n\n\r\nHere I could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat wide, and even slipping in a\r\nslight interjectional observation: \u201cVivacities? Impetus? Fougue? I didn\u2019t\r\nknow\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChut! \u00e0 l\u2019instant! There! there I went\u2014vive comme la poudre!\u201d He was sorry\u2014he\r\nwas very sorry: for my sake he grieved over the hapless peculiarity. This\r\n\u201cemportement,\u201d this \u201cchaleur\u201d\u2014generous, perhaps, but excessive\u2014would yet, he\r\nfeared, do me a mischief. It was a pity: I was not\u2014he believed, in his\r\nsoul\u2014wholly without good qualities: and would I but hear reason, and be more\r\nsedate, more sober, less \u201cen l\u2019air,\u201d less \u201ccoquette,\u201d less taken by show, less\r\nprone to set an undue value on outside excellence\u2014to make much of the\r\nattentions of people remarkable chiefly for so many feet of stature, \u201cdes\r\ncouleurs de poup\u00e9e,\u201d \u201cun nez plus ou moins bien fait,\u201d and an enormous amount\r\nof fatuity\u2014I might yet prove an useful, perhaps an exemplary character. But, as\r\nit was\u2014And here, the little man\u2019s voice was for a minute choked.\r\n\n\r\nI would have looked up at him, or held out my hand, or said a soothing word;\r\nbut I was afraid, if I stirred, I should either laugh or cry; so odd, in all\r\nthis, was the mixture of the touching and the absurd.\r\n\n\r\nI thought he had nearly done: but no; he sat down that he might go on at his\r\nease.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhile he, M. Paul, was on these painful topics, he would dare my anger for the\r\nsake of my good, and would venture to refer to a change he had noticed in my\r\ndress. He was free to confess that when he first knew me\u2014or, rather, was in the\r\nhabit of catching a passing glimpse of me from time to time\u2014I satisfied him on\r\nthis point: the gravity, the austere simplicity, obvious in this particular,\r\nwere such as to inspire the highest hopes for my best interests. What fatal\r\ninfluence had impelled me lately to introduce flowers under the brim of my\r\nbonnet, to wear \u2018des cols brod\u00e9s,\u2019 and even to appear on one occasion in a\r\nscarlet gown\u2014he might indeed conjecture, but, for the present, would not\r\nopenly declare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I interrupted, and this time not without an accent at once indignant and\r\nhorror-struck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScarlet, Monsieur Paul? It was not scarlet! It was pink, and pale pink too,\r\nand further subdued by black lace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPink or scarlet, yellow or crimson, pea-green or sky-blue, it was all one:\r\nthese were all flaunting, giddy colours; and as to the lace I talked of,\r\nthat was but a \u2018colifichet de plus.\u2019\u201d And he sighed over my degeneracy.\r\n\u201cHe could not, he was sorry to say, be so particular on this theme as he could\r\nwish: not possessing the exact names of these \u2018babioles,\u2019 he might run into\r\nsmall verbal errors which would not fail to lay him open to my sarcasm, and\r\nexcite my unhappily sudden and passionate disposition. He would merely say, in\r\ngeneral terms\u2014and in these general terms he knew he was correct\u2014that my costume\r\nhad of late assumed \u2018des fa\u00e7ons mondaines,\u2019 which it wounded him to see.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat \u201cfa\u00e7ons mondaines\u201d he discovered in my present winter merino and plain\r\nwhite collar, I own it puzzled me to guess: and when I asked him, he said it\r\nwas all made with too much attention to effect\u2014and besides, \u201chad I not a bow of\r\nribbon at my neck?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if you condemn a bow of ribbon for a lady, Monsieur, you would necessarily\r\ndisapprove of a thing like this for a gentleman?\u201d\u2014holding up my bright little\r\nchainlet of silk and gold. His sole reply was a groan\u2014I suppose over my levity.\r\n\n\r\nAfter sitting some minutes in silence, and watching the progress of the chain,\r\nat which I now wrought more assiduously than ever, he inquired: \u201cWhether what\r\nhe had just said would have the effect of making me entirely detest him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hardly remember what answer I made, or how it came about; I don\u2019t think I\r\nspoke at all, but I know we managed to bid good-night on friendly terms: and,\r\neven after M. Paul had reached the door, he turned back just to explain, \u201cthat\r\nhe would not be understood to speak in entire condemnation of the scarlet\r\ndress\u201d (\u201cPink! pink!\u201d I threw in); \u201cthat he had no intention to deny it the\r\nmerit of looking rather well\u201d (the fact was, M. Emanuel\u2019s taste in\r\ncolours decidedly leaned to the brilliant); \u201conly he wished to counsel me,\r\nwhenever I wore it, to do so in the same spirit as if its material were\r\n\u2018bure,\u2019 and its hue \u2018gris de poussi\u00e8re.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the flowers under my bonnet, Monsieur?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey are very little\r\nones\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKeep them little, then,\u201d said he. \u201cPermit them not to become full-blown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the bow, Monsieur\u2014the bit of ribbon?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVa pour le ruban!\u201d was the propitious answer.\r\n\n\r\nAnd so we settled it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell done, Lucy Snowe!\u201d cried I to myself; \u201cyou have come in for a pretty\r\nlecture\u2014brought on yourself a \u2018rude savant,\u2019 and all through your wicked\r\nfondness for worldly vanities! Who would have thought it? You deemed yourself a\r\nmelancholy sober-sides enough! Miss Fanshawe there regards you as a second\r\nDiogenes. M. de Bassompierre, the other day, politely turned the conversation\r\nwhen it ran on the wild gifts of the actress Vashti, because, as he kindly\r\nsaid, \u2018Miss Snowe looked uncomfortable.\u2019 Dr. John Bretton knows you only as\r\n\u2018quiet Lucy\u2019\u2014\u2018a creature inoffensive as a shadow;\u2019 he has said, and you have\r\nheard him say it: \u2018Lucy\u2019s disadvantages spring from over-gravity in tastes and\r\nmanner\u2014want of colour in character and costume.\u2019 Such are your own and your\r\nfriends\u2019 impressions; and behold! there starts up a little man, differing\r\ndiametrically from all these, roundly charging you with being too airy and\r\ncheery\u2014too volatile and versatile\u2014too flowery and coloury. This harsh little\r\nman\u2014this pitiless censor\u2014gathers up all your poor scattered sins of vanity,\r\nyour luckless chiffon of rose-colour, your small fringe of a wreath, your small\r\nscrap of ribbon, your silly bit of lace, and calls you to account for the lot,\r\nand for each item. You are well habituated to be passed by as a shadow in\r\nLife\u2019s sunshine: it is a new thing to see one testily lifting his hand to\r\nscreen his eyes, because you tease him with an obtrusive ray.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"30": "\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nMONSIEUR\u2019S F\u00caTE.\n\r\nI was up the next morning an hour before daybreak, and finished my guard,\r\nkneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand, for the benefit of\r\nsuch expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last watch.\r\n\n\r\nAll my materials\u2014my whole stock of beads and silk\u2014were used up before the chain\r\nassumed the length and richness I wished; I had wrought it double, as I knew,\r\nby the rule of contraries, that to, suit the particular taste whose\r\ngratification was in view, an effective appearance was quite indispensable. As\r\na finish to the ornament, a little gold clasp was needed; fortunately I\r\npossessed it in the fastening of my sole necklace; I duly detached and\r\nre-attached it, then coiled compactly the completed guard; and enclosed it in a\r\nsmall box I had bought for its brilliancy, made of some tropic shell of the\r\ncolour called \u201cnacarat,\u201d and decked with a little coronal of sparkling blue\r\nstones. Within the lid of the box, I carefully graved with my scissors\u2019 point\r\ncertain initials.\r\n\n\r\nThe reader will, perhaps, remember the description of Madame Beck\u2019s f\u00eate; nor\r\nwill he have forgotten that at each anniversary, a handsome present was\r\nsubscribed for and offered by the school. The observance of this day was a\r\ndistinction accorded to none but Madame, and, in a modified form, to her\r\nkinsman and counsellor, M. Emanuel. In the latter case it was an honour\r\nspontaneously awarded, not plotted and contrived beforehand, and offered an\r\nadditional proof, amongst many others, of the estimation in which\u2014despite his\r\npartialities, prejudices, and irritabilities\u2014the professor of literature was\r\nheld by his pupils. No article of value was offered to him: he distinctly gave\r\nit to be understood, that he would accept neither plate nor jewellery. Yet he\r\nliked a slight tribute; the cost, the money-value, did not touch him: a diamond\r\nring, a gold snuff-box, presented, with pomp, would have pleased him less than\r\na flower, or a drawing, offered simply and with sincere feelings. Such was his\r\nnature. He was a man, not wise in his generation, yet could he claim a filial\r\nsympathy with \u201cthe dayspring on high.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul\u2019s f\u00eate fell on the first of March and a Thursday. It proved a fine\r\nsunny day; and being likewise the morning on which it was customary to attend\r\nmass; being also otherwise distinguished by the half-holiday which permitted\r\nthe privilege of walking out, shopping, or paying visits in the afternoon:\r\nthese combined considerations induced a general smartness and freshness of\r\ndress. Clean collars were in vogue; the ordinary dingy woollen classe-dress was\r\nexchanged for something lighter and clearer. Mademoiselle Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre, on\r\nthis particular Thursday, even assumed a \u201crobe de soie,\u201d deemed in economical\r\nLabassecour an article of hazardous splendour and luxury; nay, it was remarked\r\nthat she sent for a \u201ccoiffeur\u201d to dress her hair that morning; there were\r\npupils acute enough to discover that she had bedewed her handkerchief and her\r\nhands with a new and fashionable perfume. Poor Z\u00e9lie! It was much her wont to\r\ndeclare about this time, that she was tired to death of a life of seclusion and\r\nlabour; that she longed to have the means and leisure for relaxation; to have\r\nsome one to work for her\u2014a husband who would pay her debts (she was woefully\r\nencumbered with debt), supply her wardrobe, and leave her at liberty, as she\r\nsaid, to \u201cgo\u00fbter un peu les plaisirs.\u201d It had long been rumoured, that her eye\r\nwas upon M. Emanuel. Monsieur Emanuel\u2019s eye was certainly often upon her. He\r\nwould sit and watch her perseveringly for minutes together. I have seen him\r\ngive her a quarter-of-an-hour\u2019s gaze, while the class was silently composing,\r\nand he sat throned on his estrade, unoccupied. Conscious always of this\r\nbasilisk attention, she would writhe under it, half-flattered, half-puzzled,\r\nand Monsieur would follow her sensations, sometimes looking appallingly acute;\r\nfor in some cases, he had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct, and\r\npierced in its hiding-place the last lurking thought of the heart, and\r\ndiscerned under florid veilings the bare; barren places of the spirit: yes, and\r\nits perverted tendencies, and its hidden false curves\u2014all that men and women\r\nwould not have known\u2014the twisted spine, the malformed limb that was born with\r\nthem, and far worse, the stain or disfigurement they have perhaps brought on\r\nthemselves. No calamity so accursed but M. Emanuel could pity and forgive, if\r\nit were acknowledged candidly; but where his questioning eyes met dishonest\r\ndenial\u2014where his ruthless researches found deceitful concealment\u2014oh, then, he\r\ncould be cruel, and I thought wicked! he would exultantly snatch the screen\r\nfrom poor shrinking wretches, passionately hurry them to the summit of the\r\nmount of exposure, and there show them all naked, all false\u2014poor living\r\nlies\u2014the spawn of that horrid Truth which cannot be looked on unveiled. He\r\nthought he did justice; for my part I doubt whether man has a right to do such\r\njustice on man: more than once in these his visitations, I have felt compelled\r\nto give tears to his victims, and not spared ire and keen reproach to himself.\r\nHe deserved it; but it was difficult to shake him in his firm conviction that\r\nthe work was righteous and needed.\r\n\n\r\nBreakfast being over and mass attended, the school-bell rang and the rooms\r\nfilled: a very pretty spectacle was presented in classe. Pupils and teachers\r\nsat neatly arrayed, orderly and expectant, each bearing in her hand the bouquet\r\nof felicitation\u2014the prettiest spring-flowers all fresh, and filling the air\r\nwith their fragrance: I only had no bouquet. I like to see flowers growing, but\r\nwhen they are gathered, they cease to please. I look on them as things rootless\r\nand perishable; their likeness to life makes me sad. I never offer flowers to\r\nthose I love; I never wish to receive them from hands dear to me. Mademoiselle\r\nSt. Pierre marked my empty hands\u2014she could not believe I had been so remiss;\r\nwith avidity her eye roved over and round me: surely I must have some solitary\r\nsymbolic flower somewhere: some small knot of violets, something to win myself\r\npraise for taste, commendation for ingenuity. The unimaginative \u201cAnglaise\u201d\r\nproved better than the Parisienne\u2019s fears: she sat literally unprovided, as\r\nbare of bloom or leaf as the winter tree. This ascertained, Z\u00e9lie smiled, well\r\npleased.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow wisely you have acted to keep your money, Miss Lucie,\u201d she said: \u201csilly I\r\nhave gone and thrown away two francs on a bouquet of hot-house flowers!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she showed with pride her splendid nosegay.\r\n\n\r\nBut hush! a step: the step. It came prompt, as usual, but with a\r\npromptitude, we felt disposed to flatter ourselves, inspired by other feelings\r\nthan mere excitability of nerve and vehemence of intent. We thought our\r\nProfessor\u2019s \u201cfoot-fall\u201d (to speak romantically) had in it a friendly promise\r\nthis morning; and so it had.\r\n\n\r\nHe entered in a mood which made him as good as a new sunbeam to the already\r\nwell-lit first classe. The morning light playing amongst our plants and\r\nlaughing on our walls, caught an added lustre from M. Paul\u2019s all-benignant\r\nsalute. Like a true Frenchman (though I don\u2019t know why I should say so, for he\r\nwas of strain neither French nor Labassecourien), he had dressed for the\r\n\u201csituation\u201d and the occasion. Not by the vague folds, sinister and\r\nconspirator-like, of his soot-dark palet\u00f4t were the outlines of his person\r\nobscured; on the contrary, his figure (such as it was, I don\u2019t boast of it) was\r\nwell set off by a civilized coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold. The\r\ndefiant and pagan bonnet-grec had vanished: bare-headed, he came upon us,\r\ncarrying a Christian hat in his gloved hand. The little man looked well, very\r\nwell; there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye, and a glow of good\r\nfeeling on his dark complexion, which passed perfectly in the place of beauty:\r\none really did not care to observe that his nose, though far from small, was of\r\nno particular shape, his cheek thin, his brow marked and square, his mouth no\r\nrose-bud: one accepted him as he was, and felt his presence the reverse of\r\ndamping or insignificant.\r\n\n\r\nHe passed to his desk; he placed on the same his hat and gloves. \u201cBon jour, mes\r\namies,\u201d said he, in a tone that somehow made amends to some amongst us for many\r\na sharp snap and savage snarl: not a jocund, good-fellow tone, still less an\r\nunctuous priestly, accent, but a voice he had belonging to himself\u2014a voice used\r\nwhen his heart passed the words to his lips. That same heart did speak\r\nsometimes; though an irritable, it was not an ossified organ: in its core was a\r\nplace, tender beyond a man\u2019s tenderness; a place that humbled him to little\r\nchildren, that bound him to girls and women to whom, rebel as he would, he\r\ncould not disown his affinity, nor quite deny that, on the whole, he was better\r\nwith them than with his own sex.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe all wish Monsieur a good day, and present to him our congratulations on the\r\nanniversary of his f\u00eate,\u201d said Mademoiselle Z\u00e9lie, constituting herself\r\nspokeswoman of the assembly; and advancing with no more twists of affectation\r\nthan were with her indispensable to the achievement of motion, she laid her\r\ncostly bouquet before him. He bowed over it.\r\n\n\r\nThe long train of offerings followed: all the pupils, sweeping past with the\r\ngliding step foreigners practise, left their tributes as they went by. Each\r\ngirl so dexterously adjusted her separate gift, that when the last bouquet was\r\nlaid on the desk, it formed the apex to a blooming pyramid\u2014a pyramid blooming,\r\nspreading, and towering with such exuberance as, in the end, to eclipse the\r\nhero behind it. This ceremony over, seats were resumed, and we sat in dead\r\nsilence, expectant of a speech.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose five minutes might have elapsed, and the hush remained unbroken;\r\nten\u2014and there was no sound.\r\n\n\r\nMany present began, doubtless, to wonder for what Monsieur waited; as well they\r\nmight. Voiceless and viewless, stirless and wordless, he kept his station\r\nbehind the pile of flowers.\r\n\n\r\nAt last there issued forth a voice, rather deep, as if it spoke out of a\r\nhollow:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMademoiselle Z\u00e9lie looked round.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have all presented your bouquets?\u201d inquired she of the pupils.\r\n\n\r\nYes; they had all given their nosegays, from the eldest to the youngest, from\r\nthe tallest to the most diminutive. The senior mistress signified as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d was reiterated in an intonation which, deep before, had now\r\ndescended some notes lower.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Mademoiselle St. Pierre, rising, and this time speaking with\r\nher own sweet smile, \u201cI have the honour to tell you that, with a single\r\nexception, every person in classe has offered her bouquet. For Meess Lucie,\r\nMonsieur will kindly make allowance; as a foreigner she probably did not know\r\nour customs, or did not appreciate their significance. Meess Lucie has regarded\r\nthis ceremony as too frivolous to be honoured by her observance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFamous!\u201d I muttered between my teeth: \u201cyou are no bad speaker, Z\u00e9lie, when you\r\nbegin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe answer vouchsafed to Mademoiselle St Pierre from the estrade was given in\r\nthe gesticulation of a hand from behind the pyramid. This manual action seemed\r\nto deprecate words, to enjoin silence.\r\n\n\r\nA form, ere long, followed the hand. Monsieur emerged from his eclipse; and\r\nproducing himself on the front of his estrade, and gazing straight and fixedly\r\nbefore him at a vast \u201cmappe-monde\u201d covering the wall opposite, he demanded a\r\nthird time, and now in really tragic tones\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI might yet have made all right, by stepping forwards and slipping into his\r\nhand the ruddy little shell-box I at that moment held tight in my own. It was\r\nwhat I had fully purposed to do; but, first, the comic side of Monsieur\u2019s\r\nbehaviour had tempted me to delay, and now, Mademoiselle St. Pierre\u2019s affected\r\ninterference provoked contumacity. The reader not having hitherto had any cause\r\nto ascribe to Miss Snowe\u2019s character the most distant pretensions to\r\nperfection, will be scarcely surprised to learn that she felt too perverse to\r\ndefend herself from any imputation the Parisienne might choose to insinuate and\r\nbesides, M. Paul was so tragic, and took my defection so seriously, he deserved\r\nto be vexed. I kept, then, both my box and my countenance, and sat insensate as\r\nany stone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well!\u201d dropped at length from the lips of M. Paul; and having uttered\r\nthis phrase, the shadow of some great paroxysm\u2014the swell of wrath, scorn,\r\nresolve\u2014passed over his brow, rippled his lips, and lined his cheeks. Gulping\r\ndown all further comment, he launched into his customary \u201cdiscours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI can\u2019t at all remember what this \u201cdiscours\u201d was; I did not listen to it: the\r\ngulping-down process, the abrupt dismissal of his mortification or vexation,\r\nhad given me a sensation which half-counteracted the ludicrous effect of the\r\nreiterated \u201cEst-ce l\u00e0 tout?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTowards the close of the speech there came a pleasing diversion my attention\r\nwas again amusingly arrested.\r\n\n\r\nOwing to some little accidental movement\u2014I think I dropped my thimble on the\r\nfloor, and in stooping to regain it, hit the crown of my head against the sharp\r\ncorner of my desk; which casualties (exasperating to me, by rights, if to\r\nanybody) naturally made a slight bustle\u2014M. Paul became irritated, and\r\ndismissing his forced equanimity, and casting to the winds that dignity and\r\nself-control with which he never cared long to encumber himself, he broke forth\r\ninto the strain best calculated to give him ease.\r\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how, in the progress of his \u201cdiscours\u201d, he had contrived to cross\r\nthe Channel and land on British ground; but there I found him when I began to\r\nlisten.\r\n\n\r\nCasting a quick, cynical glance round the room\u2014a glance which scathed, or was\r\nintended to scathe, as it crossed me\u2014he fell with fury upon \u201cles Anglaises.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNever have I heard English women handled as M. Paul that morning handled them:\r\nhe spared nothing\u2014neither their minds, morals, manners, nor personal\r\nappearance. I specially remember his abuse of their tall stature, their long\r\nnecks, their thin arms, their slovenly dress, their pedantic education, their\r\nimpious scepticism(!), their insufferable pride, their pretentious virtue: over\r\nwhich he ground his teeth malignantly, and looked as if, had he dared, he would\r\nhave said singular things. Oh! he was spiteful, acrid, savage; and, as a\r\nnatural consequence, detestably ugly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle wicked venomous man!\u201d thought I; \u201cam I going to harass myself with\r\nfears of displeasing you, or hurting your feelings? No, indeed; you shall be\r\nindifferent to me, as the shabbiest bouquet in your pyramid.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI grieve to say I could not quite carry out this resolution. For some time the\r\nabuse of England and the English found and left me stolid: I bore it some\r\nfifteen minutes stoically enough; but this hissing cockatrice was determined to\r\nsting, and he said such things at last\u2014fastening not only upon our women, but\r\nupon our greatest names and best men; sullying, the shield of Britannia, and\r\ndabbling the union jack in mud\u2014that I was stung. With vicious relish he brought\r\nup the most spicy current continental historical falsehoods\u2014than which nothing\r\ncan be conceived more offensive. Z\u00e9lie, and the whole class, became one grin of\r\nvindictive delight; for it is curious to discover how these clowns of\r\nLabassecour secretly hate England. At last, I struck a sharp stroke on my desk,\r\nopened my lips, and let loose this cry:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVive l\u2019Angleterre, l\u2019Histoire et les H\u00e9ros! A bas la France, la Fiction et les\r\nFaquins!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe class was struck of a heap. I suppose they thought me mad. The Professor\r\nput up his handkerchief, and fiendishly smiled into its folds. Little monster\r\nof malice! He now thought he had got the victory, since he had made me angry.\r\nIn a second he became good-humoured. With great blandness he resumed the\r\nsubject of his flowers; talked poetically and symbolically of their sweetness,\r\nperfume, purity, etcetera; made Frenchified comparisons between the \u201cjeunes\r\nfilles\u201d and the sweet blossoms before him; paid Mademoiselle St. Pierre a very\r\nfull-blown compliment on the superiority of her bouquet; and ended by\r\nannouncing that the first really fine, mild, and balmy morning in spring, he\r\nintended to take the whole class out to breakfast in the country. \u201cSuch of the\r\nclass, at least,\u201d he added, with emphasis, \u201cas he could count amongst the\r\nnumber of his friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonc je n\u2019y serai pas,\u201d declared I, involuntarily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoit!\u201d was his response; and, gathering his flowers in his arms, he flashed\r\nout of classe; while I, consigning my work, scissors, thimble, and the\r\nneglected little box, to my desk, swept up-stairs. I don\u2019t know whether\r\nhe felt hot and angry, but I am free to confess that I did.\r\n\n\r\nYet with a strange evanescent anger, I had not sat an hour on the edge of my\r\nbed, picturing and repicturing his look, manner, words ere I smiled at the\r\nwhole scene. A little pang of regret I underwent that the box had not been\r\noffered. I had meant to gratify him. Fate would not have it so.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon, remembering that desks in classe were by no\r\nmeans inviolate repositories, and thinking that it was as well to secure the\r\nbox, on account of the initials in the lid, P. C. D. E., for Paul Carl (or\r\nCarlos) David Emanuel\u2014such was his full name\u2014these foreigners must always have\r\na string of baptismals\u2014I descended to the schoolroom.\r\n\n\r\nIt slept in holiday repose. The day pupils were all gone home, the boarders\r\nwere out walking, the teachers, except the surveillante of the week, were in\r\ntown, visiting or shopping; the suite of divisions was vacant; so was the\r\ngrande salle, with its huge solemn globe hanging in the midst, its pair of\r\nmany-branched chandeliers, and its horizontal grand piano closed, silent,\r\nenjoying its mid-week Sabbath. I rather wondered to find the first classe door\r\najar; this room being usually locked when empty, and being then inaccessible to\r\nany save Madame Beck and myself, who possessed a duplicate key. I wondered\r\nstill more, on approaching, to hear a vague movement as of life\u2014a step, a chair\r\nstirred, a sound like the opening of a desk.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is only Madame Beck doing inspection duty,\u201d was the conclusion following a\r\nmoment\u2019s reflection. The partially-opened door gave opportunity for assurance\r\non this point. I looked. Behold! not the inspecting garb of Madame Beck\u2014the\r\nshawl and the clean cap\u2014but the coat, and the close-shorn, dark head of a man.\r\nThis person occupied my chair; his olive hand held my desk open, his nose was\r\nlost to view amongst my papers. His back was towards me, but there could not be\r\na moment\u2019s question about identity. Already was the attire of ceremony\r\ndiscarded: the cherished and ink-stained palet\u00f4t was resumed; the perverse\r\nbonnet-grec lay on the floor, as if just dropped from the hand, culpably busy.\r\n\n\r\nNow I knew, and I had long known, that that hand of M. Emanuel\u2019s was on the\r\nmost intimate terms with my desk; that it raised and lowered the lid, ransacked\r\nand arranged the contents, almost as familiarly as my own. The fact was not\r\ndubious, nor did he wish it to be so: he left signs of each visit palpable and\r\nunmistakable; hitherto, however, I had never caught him in the act: watch as I\r\nwould, I could not detect the hours and moments of his coming. I saw the\r\nbrownie\u2019s work in exercises left overnight full of faults, and found next\r\nmorning carefully corrected: I profited by his capricious good-will in loans\r\nfull welcome and refreshing. Between a sallow dictionary and worn-out grammar\r\nwould magically grow a fresh interesting new work, or a classic, mellow and\r\nsweet in its ripe age. Out of my work-basket would laughingly peep a romance,\r\nunder it would lurk the pamphlet, the magazine, whence last evening\u2019s reading\r\nhad been extracted. Impossible to doubt the source whence these treasures\r\nflowed: had there been no other indication, one condemning and traitor\r\npeculiarity, common to them all, settled the question\u2014they smelt of\r\ncigars. This was very shocking, of course: I thought so at first,\r\nand used to open the window with some bustle, to air my desk, and with\r\nfastidious finger and thumb, to hold the peccant brochures forth to the\r\npurifying breeze. I was cured of that formality suddenly. Monsieur caught me at\r\nit one day, understood the inference, instantly relieved my hand of its burden,\r\nand, in another moment, would have thrust the same into the glowing stove. It\r\nchanced to be a book, on the perusal of which I was bent; so for once I proved\r\nas decided and quicker than himself; recaptured the spoil, and\u2014having saved\r\nthis volume\u2014never hazarded a second. With all this, I had never yet been able\r\nto arrest in his visits the freakish, friendly, cigar-loving phantom.\r\n\n\r\nBut now at last I had him: there he was\u2014the very brownie himself; and there,\r\ncurling from his lips, was the pale blue breath of his Indian darling: he was\r\nsmoking into my desk: it might well betray him. Provoked at this particular,\r\nand yet pleased to surprise him\u2014pleased, that is, with the mixed feeling of the\r\nhousewife who discovers at last her strange elfin ally busy in the dairy at the\r\nuntimely churn\u2014I softly stole forward, stood behind him, bent with precaution\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\n\r\nMy heart smote me to see that\u2014after this morning\u2019s hostility, after my seeming\r\nremissness, after the puncture experienced by his feelings, and the ruffling\r\nundergone by his temper\u2014he, all willing to forget and forgive, had brought me a\r\ncouple of handsome volumes, of which the title and authorship were guarantees\r\nfor interest. Now, as he sat bending above the desk, he was stirring up its\r\ncontents; but with gentle and careful hand; disarranging indeed, but not\r\nharming. My heart smote me: as I bent over him, as he sat unconscious, doing me\r\nwhat good he could, and I daresay not feeling towards me unkindly, my morning\u2019s\r\nanger quite melted: I did not dislike Professor Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nI think he heard me breathe. He turned suddenly: his temperament was nervous,\r\nyet he never started, and seldom changed colour: there was something hardy\r\nabout him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were gone into town with the other teachers,\u201d said he, taking a\r\ngrim gripe of his self-possession, which half-escaped him\u2014\u201cIt is as well you\r\nare not. Do you think I care for being caught? Not I. I often visit your desk.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I know it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou find a brochure or tome now and then; but you don\u2019t read them, because\r\nthey have passed under this?\u201d\u2014touching his cigar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have, and are no better for the process; but I read them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWithout pleasure?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur must not be contradicted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you like them, or any of them?\u2014are they acceptable?\u201d \u201cMonsieur has seen me\r\nreading them a hundred times, and knows I have not so many recreations as to\r\nundervalue those he provides.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean well; and, if you see that I mean well, and derive some little\r\namusement from my efforts, why can we not be friends?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA fatalist would say\u2014because we cannot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis morning,\u201d he continued, \u201cI awoke in a bright mood, and came into classe\r\nhappy; you spoiled my day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur, only an hour or two of it, and that unintentionally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnintentionally! No. It was my f\u00eate-day; everybody wished me happiness but\r\nyou. The little children of the third division gave each her knot of violets,\r\nlisped each her congratulation:\u2014you\u2014nothing. Not a bud, leaf, whisper\u2014not a\r\nglance. Was this unintentional?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI meant no harm.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you really did not know our custom? You were unprepared? You would\r\nwillingly have laid out a few centimes on a flower to give me pleasure, had you\r\nbeen aware that it was expected? Say so, and all is forgotten, and the pain\r\nsoothed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did know that it was expected: I was prepared; yet I laid out no\r\ncentimes on flowers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well\u2014you do right to be honest. I should almost have hated you had you\r\nflattered and lied. Better declare at once \u2018Paul Carl Emanuel\u2014je te d\u00e9teste,\r\nmon gar\u00e7on!\u2019\u2014than smile an interest, look an affection, and be false and cold\r\nat heart. False and cold I don\u2019t think you are; but you have made a great\r\nmistake in life, that I believe; I think your judgment is warped\u2014that you are\r\nindifferent where you ought to be grateful\u2014and perhaps devoted and infatuated,\r\nwhere you ought to be cool as your name. Don\u2019t suppose that I wish you to have\r\na passion for me, Mademoiselle; Dieu vous en garde! What do you start for?\r\nBecause I said passion? Well, I say it again. There is such a word, and there\r\nis such a thing\u2014though not within these walls, thank heaven! You are no child\r\nthat one should not speak of what exists; but I only uttered the word\u2014the\r\nthing, I assure you, is alien to my whole life and views. It died in the\r\npast\u2014in the present it lies buried\u2014its grave is deep-dug, well-heaped, and many\r\nwinters old: in the future there will be a resurrection, as I believe to my\r\nsouls consolation; but all will then be changed\u2014form and feeling: the mortal\r\nwill have put on immortality\u2014it will rise, not for earth, but heaven. All I say\r\nto you, Miss Lucy Snowe, is\u2014that you ought to treat Professor Paul\r\nEmanuel decently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not, and did not contradict such a sentiment.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he pursued, \u201cwhen it is your f\u00eate-day, and I will not grudge\r\na few centimes for a small offering.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will be like me, Monsieur: this cost more than a few centimes, and I did\r\nnot grudge its price.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd taking from the open desk the little box, I put it into his hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt lay ready in my lap this morning,\u201d I continued; \u201cand if Monsieur had been\r\nrather more patient, and Mademoiselle St. Pierre less interfering\u2014perhaps I\r\nshould say, too, if I had been calmer and wiser\u2014I should have given it\r\nthen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe looked at the box: I saw its clear warm tint and bright azure circlet\r\npleased his eyes. I told him to open it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy initials!\u201d said he, indicating the letters in the lid. \u201cWho told you I was\r\ncalled Carl David?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA little bird, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes it fly from me to you? Then one can tie a message under its wing when\r\nneedful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took out the chain\u2014a trifle indeed as to value, but glossy with silk and\r\nsparkling with beads. He liked that too\u2014admired it artlessly, like a child.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, for you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is the thing you were working at last night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou finished it this morning?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou commenced it with the intention that it should be mine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd offered on my f\u00eate-day?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis purpose continued as you wove it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain I assented.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen it is not necessary that I should cut out any portion\u2014saying, this part\r\nis not mine: it was plaited under the idea and for the adornment of another?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy no means. It is neither necessary, nor would it be just.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis object is all mine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat object is yours entirely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStraightway Monsieur opened his palet\u00f4t, arranged the guard splendidly across\r\nhis chest, displaying as much and suppressing as little as he could: for he had\r\nno notion of concealing what he admired and thought decorative. As to the box,\r\nhe pronounced it a superb bonbonni\u00e8re\u2014he was fond of bonbons, by the way\u2014and as\r\nhe always liked to share with others what pleased himself, he would give his\r\n\u201cdrag\u00e9es\u201d as freely as he lent his books. Amongst the kind brownie\u2019s gifts left\r\nin my desk, I forgot to enumerate many a paper of chocolate comfits. His tastes\r\nin these matters were southern, and what we think infantine. His simple lunch\r\nconsisted frequently of a \u201cbrioche,\u201d which, as often as not, he shared with\r\nsome child of the third division.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA pr\u00e9sent c\u2019est un fait accompli,\u201d said he, re-adjusting his palet\u00f4t; and we\r\nhad no more words on the subject. After looking over the two volumes he had\r\nbrought, and cutting away some pages with his penknife (he generally pruned\r\nbefore lending his books, especially if they were novels, and sometimes I was a\r\nlittle provoked at the severity of his censorship, the retrenchments\r\ninterrupting the narrative), he rose, politely touched his bonnet-grec, and\r\nbade me a civil good-day.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe are friends now,\u201d thought I, \u201ctill the next time we quarrel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe might have quarrelled again that very same evening, but, wonderful to\r\nrelate, failed, for once, to make the most of our opportunity.\r\n\n\r\nContrary to all expectation, M. Paul arrived at the study-hour. Having seen so\r\nmuch of him in the morning, we did not look for his presence at night. No\r\nsooner were we seated at lessons, however, than he appeared. I own I was glad\r\nto see him, so glad that I could not help greeting his arrival with a smile;\r\nand when he made his way to the same seat about which so serious a\r\nmisunderstanding had formerly arisen, I took good care not to make too much\r\nroom for him; he watched with a jealous, side-long look, to see whether I\r\nshrank away, but I did not, though the bench was a little crowded. I was losing\r\nthe early impulse to recoil from M. Paul. Habituated to the palet\u00f4t and\r\nbonnet-grec, the neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable\r\nor very formidable. I did not now sit restrained, \u201casphyxi\u00e9e\u201d (as he used to\r\nsay) at his side; I stirred when I wished to stir, coughed when it was\r\nnecessary, even yawned when I was tired\u2014did, in short, what I pleased, blindly\r\nreliant upon his indulgence. Nor did my temerity, this evening at least, meet\r\nthe punishment it perhaps merited; he was both indulgent and good-natured; not\r\na cross glance shot from his eyes, not a hasty word left his lips. Till the\r\nvery close of the evening, he did not indeed address me at all, yet I felt,\r\nsomehow, that he was full of friendliness. Silence is of different kinds, and\r\nbreathes different meanings; no words could inspire a pleasanter content than\r\ndid M. Paul\u2019s worldless presence. When the tray came in, and the bustle of\r\nsupper commenced, he just said, as he retired, that he wished me a good night\r\nand sweet dreams; and a good night and sweet dreams I had.\r\n\n"}
{"31": "\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nM. PAUL.\n\r\nYet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his kindly conclusions,\r\nor to suppose, with an over-hasty charity, that from that day M. Paul became a\r\nchanged character\u2014easy to live with, and no longer apt to flash danger and\r\ndiscomfort round him.\r\n\n\r\nNo; he was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods. When over-wrought,\r\nwhich he often was, he became acutely irritable; and, besides, his veins were\r\ndark with a livid belladonna tincture, the essence of jealousy. I do not mean\r\nmerely the tender jealousy of the heart, but that sterner, narrower sentiment\r\nwhose seat is in the head.\r\n\n\r\nI used to think, as I sat looking at M. Paul, while he was knitting his brow or\r\nprotruding his lip over some exercise of mine, which had not as many faults as\r\nhe wished (for he liked me to commit faults: a knot of blunders was sweet to\r\nhim as a cluster of nuts), that he had points of resemblance to Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. I think so still.\r\n\n\r\nIn a shameless disregard of magnanimity, he resembled the great Emperor. M.\r\nPaul would have quarrelled with twenty learned women, would have unblushingly\r\ncarried on a system of petty bickering and recrimination with a whole capital\r\nof coteries, never troubling himself about loss or lack of dignity. He would\r\nhave exiled fifty Madame de Sta\u00ebls, if they had annoyed, offended,\r\noutrivalled, or opposed him.\r\n\n\r\nI well remember a hot episode of his with a certain Madame Panache\u2014a lady\r\ntemporarily employed by Madame Beck to give lessons in history. She was\r\nclever\u2014that is, she knew a good deal; and, besides, thoroughly possessed the\r\nart of making the most of what she knew; of words and confidence she held\r\nunlimited command. Her personal appearance was far from destitute of\r\nadvantages; I believe many people would have pronounced her \u201ca fine woman;\u201d and\r\nyet there were points in her robust and ample attractions, as well as in her\r\nbustling and demonstrative presence, which, it appeared, the nice and\r\ncapricious tastes of M. Paul could not away with. The sound of her voice,\r\nechoing through the carr\u00e9, would put him into a strange taking; her long free\r\nstep\u2014almost stride\u2014along the corridor, would often make him snatch up his\r\npapers and decamp on the instant.\r\n\n\r\nWith malicious intent he bethought himself, one day, to intrude on her class;\r\nas quick as lightning he gathered her method of instruction; it differed from a\r\npet plan of his own. With little ceremony, and less courtesy, he pointed out\r\nwhat he termed her errors. Whether he expected submission and attention, I know\r\nnot; he met an acrid opposition, accompanied by a round reprimand for his\r\ncertainly unjustifiable interference.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of withdrawing with dignity, as he might still have done, he threw down\r\nthe gauntlet of defiance. Madame Panache, bellicose as a Penthesilea, picked it\r\nup in a minute. She snapped her fingers in the intermeddler\u2019s face; she rushed\r\nupon him with a storm of words. M. Emanuel was eloquent; but Madame Panache was\r\nvoluble. A system of fierce antagonism ensued. Instead of laughing in his\r\nsleeve at his fair foe, with all her sore amour-propre and loud self-assertion,\r\nM. Paul detested her with intense seriousness; he honoured her with his earnest\r\nfury; he pursued her vindictively and implacably, refusing to rest peaceably in\r\nhis bed, to derive due benefit from his meals, or even serenely to relish his\r\ncigar, till she was fairly rooted out of the establishment. The Professor\r\nconquered, but I cannot say that the laurels of this victory shadowed\r\ngracefully his temples. Once I ventured to hint as much. To my great surprise\r\nhe allowed that I might be right, but averred that when brought into contact\r\nwith either men or women of the coarse, self-complacent quality, whereof Madame\r\nPanache was a specimen, he had no control over his own passions; an unspeakable\r\nand active aversion impelled him to a war of extermination.\r\n\n\r\nThree months afterwards, hearing that his vanquished foe had met with reverses,\r\nand was likely to be really distressed for want of employment, he forgot his\r\nhatred, and alike active in good and evil, he moved heaven and earth till he\r\nfound her a place. Upon her coming to make up former differences, and thank him\r\nfor his recent kindness, the old voice\u2014a little loud\u2014the old manner\u2014a little\r\nforward\u2014so acted upon him that in ten minutes he started up and bowed her, or\r\nrather himself, out of the room, in a transport of nervous irritation.\r\n\n\r\nTo pursue a somewhat audacious parallel, in a love of power, in an eager grasp\r\nafter supremacy, M. Emanuel was like Bonaparte. He was a man not always to be\r\nsubmitted to. Sometimes it was needful to resist; it was right to stand still,\r\nto look up into his eyes and tell him that his requirements went beyond\r\nreason\u2014that his absolutism verged on tyranny.\r\n\n\r\nThe dawnings, the first developments of peculiar talent appearing within his\r\nrange, and under his rule, curiously excited, even disturbed him. He watched\r\nits struggle into life with a scowl; he held back his hand\u2014perhaps said, \u201cCome\r\non if you have strength,\u201d but would not aid the birth.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the pang and peril of the first conflict were over, when the breath of\r\nlife was drawn, when he saw the lungs expand and contract, when he felt the\r\nheart beat and discovered life in the eye, he did not yet offer to foster.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProve yourself true ere I cherish you,\u201d was his ordinance; and how difficult\r\nhe made that proof! What thorns and briers, what flints, he strewed in the path\r\nof feet not inured to rough travel! He watched tearlessly\u2014ordeals that he\r\nexacted should be passed through\u2014fearlessly. He followed footprints that, as\r\nthey approached the bourne, were sometimes marked in blood\u2014followed them\r\ngrimly, holding the austerest police-watch over the pain-pressed pilgrim. And\r\nwhen at last he allowed a rest, before slumber might close the eyelids, he\r\nopened those same lids wide, with pitiless finger and thumb, and gazed deep\r\nthrough the pupil and the irids into the brain, into the heart, to search if\r\nVanity, or Pride, or Falsehood, in any of its subtlest forms, was discoverable\r\nin the furthest recess of existence. If, at last, he let the neophyte sleep, it\r\nwas but a moment; he woke him suddenly up to apply new tests: he sent him on\r\nirksome errands when he was staggering with weariness; he tried the temper, the\r\nsense, and the health; and it was only when every severest test had been\r\napplied and endured, when the most corrosive aquafortis had been used, and\r\nfailed to tarnish the ore, that he admitted it genuine, and, still in clouded\r\nsilence, stamped it with his deep brand of approval.\r\n\n\r\nI speak not ignorant of these evils.\r\n\n\r\nTill the date at which the last chapter closes, M. Paul had not been my\r\nprofessor\u2014he had not given me lessons, but about that time, accidentally\r\nhearing me one day acknowledge an ignorance of some branch of education (I\r\nthink it was arithmetic), which would have disgraced a charity-school boy, as\r\nhe very truly remarked, he took me in hand, examined me first, found me, I need\r\nnot say, abundantly deficient, gave me some books and appointed me some tasks.\r\n\n\r\nHe did this at first with pleasure, indeed with unconcealed exultation,\r\ncondescending to say that he believed I was \u201cbonne et pas trop faible\u201d (i.e.\r\nwell enough disposed, and not wholly destitute of parts), but, owing he\r\nsupposed to adverse circumstances, \u201cas yet in a state of wretchedly imperfect\r\nmental development.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe beginning of all effort has indeed with me been marked by a preternatural\r\nimbecility. I never could, even in forming a common acquaintance, assert or\r\nprove a claim to average quickness. A depressing and difficult passage has\r\nprefaced every new page I have turned in life.\r\n\n\r\nSo long as this passage lasted, M. Paul was very kind, very good, very\r\nforbearing; he saw the sharp pain inflicted, and felt the weighty humiliation\r\nimposed by my own sense of incapacity; and words can hardly do justice to his\r\ntenderness and helpfulness. His own eyes would moisten, when tears of shame and\r\neffort clouded mine; burdened as he was with work, he would steal half his\r\nbrief space of recreation to give to me.\r\n\n\r\nBut, strange grief! when that heavy and overcast dawn began at last to yield to\r\nday; when my faculties began to struggle themselves, free, and my time of\r\nenergy and fulfilment came; when I voluntarily doubled, trebled, quadrupled the\r\ntasks he set, to please him as I thought, his kindness became sternness; the\r\nlight changed in his eyes from a beam to a spark; he fretted, he opposed, he\r\ncurbed me imperiously; the more I did, the harder I worked, the less he seemed\r\ncontent. Sarcasms of which the severity amazed and puzzled me, harassed my\r\nears; then flowed out the bitterest inuendoes against the \u201cpride of intellect.\u201d\r\nI was vaguely threatened with I know not what doom, if I ever trespassed the\r\nlimits proper to my sex, and conceived a contraband appetite for unfeminine\r\nknowledge. Alas! I had no such appetite. What I loved, it joyed me by any\r\neffort to content; but the noble hunger for science in the abstract\u2014the godlike\r\nthirst after discovery\u2014these feelings were known to me but by briefest flashes.\r\n\n\r\nYet, when M. Paul sneered at me, I wanted to possess them more fully; his\r\ninjustice stirred in me ambitious wishes\u2014it imparted a strong stimulus\u2014it gave\r\nwings to aspiration.\r\n\n\r\nIn the beginning, before I had penetrated to motives, that uncomprehended sneer\r\nof his made my heart ache, but by-and-by it only warmed the blood in my veins,\r\nand sent added action to my pulses. Whatever my powers\u2014feminine or the\r\ncontrary\u2014God had given them, and I felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of\r\nhis bestowal.\r\n\n\r\nThe combat was very sharp for a time. I seemed to have lost M. Paul\u2019s\r\naffection; he treated me strangely. In his most unjust moments he would\r\ninsinuate that I had deceived him when I appeared, what he called \u201cfaible\u201d\u2014that\r\nis incompetent; he said I had feigned a false incapacity. Again, he would turn\r\nsuddenly round and accuse me of the most far-fetched imitations and impossible\r\nplagiarisms, asserting that I had extracted the pith out of books I had not so\r\nmuch as heard of\u2014and over the perusal of which I should infallibly have fallen\r\ndown in a sleep as deep as that of Eutychus.\r\n\n\r\nOnce, upon his preferring such an accusation, I turned upon him\u2014I rose against\r\nhim. Gathering an armful of his books out of my desk, I filled my apron and\r\npoured them in a heap upon his estrade, at his feet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake them away, M. Paul,\u201d I said, \u201cand teach me no more. I never asked to be\r\nmade learned, and you compel me to feel very profoundly that learning is not\r\nhappiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd returning to my desk, I laid my head on my arms, nor would I speak to him\r\nfor two days afterwards. He pained and chagrined me. His affection had been\r\nvery sweet and dear\u2014a pleasure new and incomparable: now that this seemed\r\nwithdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.\r\n\n\r\nThe books, however, were not taken away; they were all restored with careful\r\nhand to their places, and he came as usual to teach me. He made his peace\r\nsomehow\u2014too readily, perhaps: I ought to have stood out longer, but when he\r\nlooked kind and good, and held out his hand with amity, memory refused to\r\nreproduce with due force his oppressive moments. And then, reconcilement is\r\nalways sweet!\r\n\n\r\nOn a certain morning a message came from my godmother, inviting me to attend\r\nsome notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms before described.\r\nDr. John had brought the message himself, and delivered it verbally to Rosine,\r\nwho had not scrupled to follow the steps of M. Emanuel, then passing to the\r\nfirst classe, and, in his presence, stand \u201ccarr\u00e9ment\u201d before my desk, hand in\r\napron-pocket, and rehearse the same, saucily and aloud, concluding with the\r\nwords, \u201cQu\u2019il est vraiment beau, Mademoiselle, ce jeune docteur! Quels\r\nyeux\u2014quel regard! Tenez! J\u2019en ai le c\u0153ur tout \u00e9mu!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen she was gone, my professor demanded of me why I suffered \u201ccette fille\r\neffront\u00e9e, cette cr\u00e9ature sans pudeur,\u201d to address me in such terms.\r\n\n\r\nI had no pacifying answer to give. The terms were precisely such as Rosine\u2014a\r\nyoung lady in whose skull the organs of reverence and reserve were not largely\r\ndeveloped\u2014was in the constant habit of using. Besides, what she said about the\r\nyoung doctor was true enough. Graham was handsome; he had fine eyes and\r\na thrilling glance. An observation to that effect actually formed itself into\r\nsound on my lips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElle ne dit que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! vous trouvez?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais, sans doute.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe lesson to which we had that day to submit was such as to make us very glad\r\nwhen it terminated. At its close, the released pupils rushed out,\r\nhalf-trembling, half-exultant. I, too, was going. A mandate to remain arrested\r\nme. I muttered that I wanted some fresh air sadly\u2014the stove was in a glow, the\r\nclasse over-heated. An inexorable voice merely recommended silence; and this\r\nsalamander\u2014for whom no room ever seemed too hot\u2014sitting down between my desk\r\nand the stove\u2014a situation in which he ought to have felt broiled, but did\r\nnot\u2014proceeded to confront me with\u2014a Greek quotation!\r\n\n\r\nIn M. Emanuel\u2019s soul rankled a chronic suspicion that I knew both Greek and\r\nLatin. As monkeys are said to have the power of speech if they would but use\r\nit, and are reported to conceal this faculty in fear of its being turned to\r\ntheir detriment, so to me was ascribed a fund of knowledge which I was supposed\r\ncriminally and craftily to conceal. The privileges of a \u201cclassical education,\u201d\r\nit was insinuated, had been mine; on flowers of Hymettus I had revelled; a\r\ngolden store, hived in memory, now silently sustained my efforts, and privily\r\nnurtured my wits.\r\n\n\r\nA hundred expedients did M. Paul employ to surprise my secret\u2014to wheedle, to\r\nthreaten, to startle it out of me. Sometimes he placed Greek and Latin books in\r\nmy way, and then watched me, as Joan of Arc\u2019s jailors tempted her with the\r\nwarrior\u2019s accoutrements, and lay in wait for the issue. Again he quoted I know\r\nnot what authors and passages, and while rolling out their sweet and sounding\r\nlines (the classic tones fell musically from his lips\u2014for he had a good\r\nvoice\u2014remarkable for compass, modulation, and matchless expression), he would\r\nfix on me a vigilant, piercing, and often malicious eye. It was evident he\r\nsometimes expected great demonstrations; they never occurred, however; not\r\ncomprehending, of course I could neither be charmed nor annoyed.\r\n\n\r\nBaffled\u2014almost angry\u2014he still clung to his fixed idea; my susceptibilities were\r\npronounced marble\u2014my face a mask. It appeared as if he could not be brought to\r\naccept the homely truth, and take me for what I was: men, and women too, must\r\nhave delusion of some sort; if not made ready to their hand, they will invent\r\nexaggeration for themselves.\r\n\n\r\nAt moments I did wish that his suspicions had been better founded. There\r\nwere times when I would have given my right hand to possess the treasures he\r\nascribed to me. He deserved condign punishment for his testy crotchets. I could\r\nhave gloried in bringing home to him his worst apprehensions astoundingly\r\nrealized. I could have exulted to burst on his vision, confront and confound\r\nhis \u201clunettes,\u201d one blaze of acquirements. Oh! why did nobody undertake to make\r\nme clever while I was young enough to learn, that I might, by one grand,\r\nsudden, inhuman revelation\u2014one cold, cruel, overwhelming triumph\u2014have for ever\r\ncrushed the mocking spirit out of Paul Carl David Emanuel!\r\n\n\r\nAlas! no such feat was in my power. To-day, as usual, his quotations fell\r\nineffectual: he soon shifted his ground.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWomen of intellect\u201d was his next theme: here he was at home. A \u201cwoman of\r\nintellect,\u201d it appeared, was a sort of \u201clusus naturae,\u201d a luckless accident, a\r\nthing for which there was neither place nor use in creation, wanted neither as\r\nwife nor worker. Beauty anticipated her in the first office. He believed in his\r\nsoul that lovely, placid, and passive feminine mediocrity was the only pillow\r\non which manly thought and sense could find rest for its aching temples; and as\r\nto work, male mind alone could work to any good practical result\u2014hein?\r\n\n\r\nThis \u201chein?\u201d was a note of interrogation intended to draw from me contradiction\r\nor objection. However, I only said\u2014\u201cCela ne me regarde pas: je ne m\u2019en soucie\r\npas;\u201d and presently added\u2014\u201cMay I go, Monsieur? They have rung the bell for the\r\nsecond d\u00e9jeuner\u201d (i.e. luncheon).\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat of that? You are not hungry?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I was,\u201d I said; \u201cI had had nothing since breakfast, at seven, and\r\nshould have nothing till dinner, at five, if I missed this bell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, he was in the same plight, but I might share with him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he broke in two the \u201cbrioche\u201d intended for his own refreshment, and gave me\r\nhalf. Truly his bark was worse than his bite; but the really formidable attack\r\nwas yet to come. While eating his cake, I could not forbear expressing my\r\nsecret wish that I really knew all of which he accused me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I sincerely feel myself to be an ignoramus?\u201d he asked, in a softened tone.\r\n\n\r\nIf I had replied meekly by an unqualified affirmative, I believe he would have\r\nstretched out his hand, and we should have been friends on the spot, but I\r\nanswered\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. I am ignorant, Monsieur, in the knowledge you ascribe to me, but\r\nI sometimes, not always, feel a knowledge of my own.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I mean?\u201d he inquired, sharply.\r\n\n\r\nUnable to answer this question in a breath, I evaded it by change of subject.\r\nHe had now finished his half of the brioche: feeling sure that on so trifling a\r\nfragment he could not have satisfied his appetite, as indeed I had not appeased\r\nmine, and inhaling the fragrance of baked apples afar from the refectory, I\r\nventured to inquire whether he did not also perceive that agreeable odour. He\r\nconfessed that he did. I said if he would let me out by the garden-door, and\r\npermit me just to run across the court, I would fetch him a plateful; and added\r\nthat I believed they were excellent, as Goton had a very good method of baking,\r\nor rather stewing fruit, putting in a little spice, sugar, and a glass or two\r\nof vin blanc\u2014might I go?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite gourmande!\u201d said he, smiling, \u201cI have not forgotten how pleased you\r\nwere with the p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e2 la cr\u00eame I once gave you, and you know very well, at this\r\nmoment, that to fetch the apples for me will be the same as getting them for\r\nyourself. Go, then, but come back quickly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd at last he liberated me on parole. My own plan was to go and return with\r\nspeed and good faith, to put the plate in at the door, and then to vanish\r\nincontinent, leaving all consequences for future settlement.\r\n\n\r\nThat intolerably keen instinct of his seemed to have anticipated my scheme: he\r\nmet me at the threshold, hurried me into the room, and fixed me in a minute in\r\nmy former seat. Taking the plate of fruit from my hand, he divided the portion\r\nintended only for himself, and ordered me to eat my share. I complied with no\r\ngood grace, and vexed, I suppose, by my reluctance, he opened a masked and\r\ndangerous battery. All he had yet said, I could count as mere sound and fury,\r\nsignifying nothing: not so of the present attack.\r\n\n\r\nIt consisted in an unreasonable proposition with which he had before afflicted\r\nme: namely, that on the next public examination-day I should engage\u2014foreigner\r\nas I was\u2014to take my place on the first form of first-class pupils, and with\r\nthem improvise a composition in French, on any subject any spectator might\r\ndictate, without benefit of grammar or lexicon.\r\n\n\r\nI knew what the result of such an experiment would be. I, to whom nature had\r\ndenied the impromptu faculty; who, in public, was by nature a cypher; whose\r\ntime of mental activity, even when alone, was not under the meridian sun; who\r\nneeded the fresh silence of morning, or the recluse peace of evening, to win\r\nfrom the Creative Impulse one evidence of his presence, one proof of his force;\r\nI, with whom that Impulse was the most intractable, the most capricious, the\r\nmost maddening of masters (him before me always excepted)\u2014a deity which\r\nsometimes, under circumstances\u2014apparently propitious, would not speak when\r\nquestioned, would not hear when appealed to, would not, when sought, be found;\r\nbut would stand, all cold, all indurated, all granite, a dark Baal with carven\r\nlips and blank eye-balls, and breast like the stone face of a tomb; and again,\r\nsuddenly, at some turn, some sound, some long-trembling sob of the wind, at\r\nsome rushing past of an unseen stream of electricity, the irrational demon\r\nwould wake unsolicited, would stir strangely alive, would rush from its\r\npedestal like a perturbed Dagon, calling to its votary for a sacrifice,\r\nwhatever the hour\u2014to its victim for some blood, or some breath, whatever the\r\ncircumstance or scene\u2014rousing its priest, treacherously promising vaticination,\r\nperhaps filling its temple with a strange hum of oracles, but sure to give half\r\nthe significance to fateful winds, and grudging to the desperate listener even\r\na miserable remnant\u2014yielding it sordidly, as though each word had been a drop\r\nof the deathless ichor of its own dark veins. And this tyrant I was to compel\r\ninto bondage, and make it improvise a theme, on a school estrade, between a\r\nMathilde and a Coralie, under the eye of a Madame Beck, for the pleasure, and\r\nto the inspiration of a bourgeois of Labassecour!\r\n\n\r\nUpon this argument M. Paul and I did battle more than once\u2014strong battle, with\r\nconfused noise of demand and rejection, exaction and repulse.\r\n\n\r\nOn this particular day I was soundly rated. \u201cThe obstinacy of my whole sex,\u201d it\r\nseems, was concentrated in me; I had an \u201corgueil de diable.\u201d I feared to fail,\r\nforsooth! What did it matter whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should\r\nnot fail, like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He wanted to see me\r\nworsted (I knew he did), and one minute he paused to take breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould I speak now, and be tractable?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever would I be tractable in this matter. Law itself should not compel me. I\r\nwould pay a fine, or undergo an imprisonment, rather than write for a show and\r\nto order, perched up on a platform.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCould softer motives influence me? Would I yield for friendship\u2019s sake?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot a whit, not a hair-breadth. No form of friendship under the sun had a\r\nright to exact such a concession. No true friendship would harass me thus.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe supposed then (with a sneer\u2014M. Paul could sneer supremely, curling his lip,\r\nopening his nostrils, contracting his eyelids)\u2014he supposed there was but one\r\nform of appeal to which I would listen, and of that form it was not for him to\r\nmake use.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnder certain persuasions, from certain quarters, je vous vois d\u2019ici,\u201d said\r\nhe, \u201ceagerly subscribing to the sacrifice, passionately arming for the effort.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMaking a simpleton, a warning, and an example of myself, before a hundred and\r\nfifty of the \u2018papas\u2019 and \u2018mammas\u2019 of Villette.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd here, losing patience, I broke out afresh with a cry that I wanted to be\r\nliberated\u2014to get out into the air\u2014I was almost in a fever.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChut!\u201d said the inexorable, \u201cthis was a mere pretext to run away; he\r\nwas not hot, with the stove close at his back; how could I suffer, thoroughly\r\nscreened by his person?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not understand his constitution. I knew nothing of the natural history\r\nof salamanders. For my own part, I was a phlegmatic islander, and sitting in an\r\noven did not agree with me; at least, might I step to the well, and get a glass\r\nof water\u2014the sweet apples had made me thirsty?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf that was all, he would do my errand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe went to fetch the water. Of course, with a door only on the latch behind me,\r\nI lost not my opportunity. Ere his return, his half-worried prey had escaped.\r\n\n"}
{"32": "\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE DRYAD.\n\r\nThe spring was advancing, and the weather had turned suddenly warm. This change\r\nof temperature brought with it for me, as probably for many others, temporary\r\ndecrease of strength. Slight exertion at this time left me overcome with\r\nfatigue\u2014sleepless nights entailed languid days.\r\n\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, having walked the distance of half a league to the\r\nProtestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking refuge in my\r\nsolitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit down, and to make of my\r\ndesk a pillow for my arms and head.\r\n\n\r\nAwhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau, and watched,\r\nthrough the glass door and the tender, lightly-strewn spring foliage, Madame\r\nBeck and a gay party of friends, whom she had entertained that day at dinner\r\nafter morning mass, walking in the centre-alley under orchard boughs dressed at\r\nthis season in blossom, and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as\r\nmountain-snow at sun-rise.\r\n\n\r\nMy principal attraction towards this group of guests lay, I remember, in one\r\nfigure\u2014that of a handsome young girl whom I had seen before as a visitor at\r\nMadame Beck\u2019s, and of whom I had been vaguely told that she was a \u201cfilleule,\u201d\r\nor god-daughter, of M. Emanuel\u2019s, and that between her mother, or aunt, or some\r\nother female relation of hers, and the Professor, had existed of old a special\r\nfriendship. M. Paul was not of the holiday band to-day, but I had seen this\r\nyoung girl with him ere now, and as far as distant observation could enable me\r\nto judge, she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with an\r\nindulgent guardian. I had seen her run up to him, put her arm through his, and\r\nhang upon him. Once, when she did so, a curious sensation had struck through\r\nme\u2014a disagreeable anticipatory sensation\u2014one of the family of presentiments, I\r\nsuppose\u2014but I refused to analyze or dwell upon it. While watching this girl,\r\nMademoiselle Sauveur by name, and following the gleam of her bright silk robe\r\n(she was always richly dressed, for she was said to be wealthy) through the\r\nflowers and the glancing leaves of tender emerald, my eyes became dazzled\u2014they\r\nclosed; my lassitude, the warmth of the day, the hum of bees and birds, all\r\nlulled me, and at last I slept.\r\n\n\r\nTwo hours stole over me. Ere I woke, the sun had declined out of sight behind\r\nthe towering houses, the garden and the room were grey, bees had gone homeward,\r\nand the flowers were closing; the party of guests, too, had vanished; each\r\nalley was void.\r\n\n\r\nOn waking, I felt much at ease\u2014not chill, as I ought to have been after sitting\r\nso still for at least two hours; my cheek and arms were not benumbed by\r\npressure against the hard desk. No wonder. Instead of the bare wood on which I\r\nhad laid them, I found a thick shawl, carefully folded, substituted for\r\nsupport, and another shawl (both taken from the corridor where such things\r\nhung) wrapped warmly round me.\r\n\n\r\nWho had done this? Who was my friend? Which of the teachers? Which of the\r\npupils? None, except St. Pierre, was inimical to me; but which of them had the\r\nart, the thought, the habit, of benefiting thus tenderly? Which of them had a\r\nstep so quiet, a hand so gentle, but I should have heard or felt her, if she\r\nhad approached or touched me in a day-sleep?\r\n\n\r\nAs to Ginevra Fanshawe, that bright young creature was not gentle at all, and\r\nwould certainly have pulled me out of my chair, if she had meddled in the\r\nmatter. I said at last: \u201cIt is Madame Beck\u2019s doing; she has come in, seen me\r\nasleep, and thought I might take cold. She considers me a useful machine,\r\nanswering well the purpose for which it was hired; so would not have me\r\nneedlessly injured. And now,\u201d methought, \u201cI\u2019ll take a walk; the evening is\r\nfresh, and not very chill.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I opened the glass door and stepped into the berceau.\r\n\n\r\nI went to my own alley: had it been dark, or even dusk, I should have hardly\r\nventured there, for I had not yet forgotten the curious illusion of vision (if\r\nillusion it were) experienced in that place some months ago. But a ray of the\r\nsetting sun burnished still the grey crown of Jean Baptiste; nor had all the\r\nbirds of the garden yet vanished into their nests amongst the tufted shrubs and\r\nthick wall-ivy. I paced up and down, thinking almost the same thoughts I had\r\npondered that night when I buried my glass jar\u2014how I should make some advance\r\nin life, take another step towards an independent position; for this train of\r\nreflection, though not lately pursued, had never by me been wholly abandoned;\r\nand whenever a certain eye was averted from me, and a certain countenance grew\r\ndark with unkindness and injustice, into that track of speculation did I at\r\nonce strike; so that, little by little, I had laid half a plan.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLiving costs little,\u201d said I to myself, \u201cin this economical town of Villette,\r\nwhere people are more sensible than I understand they are in dear old\r\nEngland\u2014infinitely less worried about appearance, and less emulous of\r\ndisplay\u2014where nobody is in the least ashamed to be quite as homely and saving\r\nas he finds convenient. House-rent, in a prudently chosen situation, need not\r\nbe high. When I shall have saved one thousand francs, I will take a tenement\r\nwith one large room, and two or three smaller ones, furnish the first with a\r\nfew benches and desks, a black tableau, an estrade for myself; upon it a chair\r\nand table, with a sponge and some white chalks; begin with taking day-pupils,\r\nand so work my way upwards. Madame Beck\u2019s commencement was\u2014as I have often\r\nheard her say\u2014from no higher starting-point, and where is she now? All these\r\npremises and this garden are hers, bought with her money; she has a competency\r\nalready secured for old age, and a flourishing establishment under her\r\ndirection, which will furnish a career for her children.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCourage, Lucy Snowe! With self-denial and economy now, and steady exertion\r\nby-and-by, an object in life need not fail you. Venture not to complain that\r\nsuch an object is too selfish, too limited, and lacks interest; be content to\r\nlabour for independence until you have proved, by winning that prize, your\r\nright to look higher. But afterwards, is there nothing more for me in life\u2014no\r\ntrue home\u2014nothing to be dearer to me than myself, and by its paramount\r\npreciousness, to draw from me better things than I care to culture for myself\r\nonly? Nothing, at whose feet I can willingly lay down the whole burden of human\r\negotism, and gloriously take up the nobler charge of labouring and living for\r\nothers? I suppose, Lucy Snowe, the orb of your life is not to be so rounded:\r\nfor you, the crescent-phase must suffice. Very good. I see a huge mass of my\r\nfellow-creatures in no better circumstances. I see that a great many men, and\r\nmore women, hold their span of life on conditions of denial and privation. I\r\nfind no reason why I should be of the few favoured. I believe in some blending\r\nof hope and sunshine sweetening the worst lots. I believe that this life is not\r\nall; neither the beginning nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust\r\nwhile I weep.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo this subject is done with. It is right to look our life-accounts bravely in\r\nthe face now and then, and settle them honestly. And he is a poor self-swindler\r\nwho lies to himself while he reckons the items, and sets down under the\r\nhead\u2014happiness that which is misery. Call anguish\u2014anguish, and despair\u2014despair;\r\nwrite both down in strong characters with a resolute pen: you will the better\r\npay your debt to Doom. Falsify: insert \u201cprivilege\u201d where you should have\r\nwritten \u201cpain;\u201d and see if your mighty creditor will allow the fraud to pass,\r\nor accept the coin with which you would cheat him. Offer to the strongest\u2014if\r\nthe darkest angel of God\u2019s host\u2014water, when he has asked blood\u2014will he take it?\r\nNot a whole pale sea for one red drop. I settled another account.\r\n\n\r\nPausing before Methusaleh\u2014the giant and patriarch of the garden\u2014and leaning my\r\nbrow against his knotty trunk, my foot rested on the stone sealing the small\r\nsepulchre at his root; and I recalled the passage of feeling therein buried; I\r\nrecalled Dr. John; my warm affection for him; my faith in his excellence; my\r\ndelight in his grace. What was become of that curious one-sided friendship\r\nwhich was half marble and half life; only on one hand truth, and on the other\r\nperhaps a jest?\r\n\n\r\nWas this feeling dead? I do not know, but it was buried. Sometimes I thought\r\nthe tomb unquiet, and dreamed strangely of disturbed earth, and of hair, still\r\ngolden, and living, obtruded through coffin-chinks.\r\n\n\r\nHad I been too hasty? I used to ask myself; and this question would occur with\r\na cruel sharpness after some brief chance interview with Dr. John. He had still\r\nsuch kind looks, such a warm hand; his voice still kept so pleasant a tone for\r\nmy name; I never liked \u201cLucy\u201d so well as when he uttered it. But I learned in\r\ntime that this benignity, this cordiality, this music, belonged in no shape to\r\nme: it was a part of himself; it was the honey of his temper; it was the balm\r\nof his mellow mood; he imparted it, as the ripe fruit rewards with sweetness\r\nthe rifling bee; he diffused it about him, as sweet plants shed their perfume.\r\nDoes the nectarine love either the bee or bird it feeds? Is the sweetbriar\r\nenamoured of the air?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.\r\nGood-night, and God bless you!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus I closed my musings. \u201cGood-night\u201d left my lips in sound; I heard the words\r\nspoken, and then I heard an echo\u2014quite close.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mademoiselle; or, rather, good-evening\u2014the sun is scarce set; I\r\nhope you slept well?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI started, but was only discomposed a moment; I knew the voice and speaker.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSlept, Monsieur! When? where?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may well inquire when\u2014where. It seems you turn day into night, and choose\r\na desk for a pillow; rather hard lodging\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was softened for me, Monsieur, while I slept. That unseen, gift-bringing\r\nthing which haunts my desk, remembered me. No matter how I fell asleep; I awoke\r\npillowed and covered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid the shawls keep you warm?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery warm. Do you ask thanks for them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. You looked pale in your slumbers: are you home-sick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be home-sick, one must have a home; which I have not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you have more need of a careful friend. I scarcely know any one, Miss\r\nLucy, who needs a friend more absolutely than you; your very faults\r\nimperatively require it. You want so much checking, regulating, and keeping\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis idea of \u201ckeeping down\u201d never left M. Paul\u2019s head; the most habitual\r\nsubjugation would, in my case, have failed to relieve him of it. No matter;\r\nwhat did it signify? I listened to him, and did not trouble myself to be too\r\nsubmissive; his occupation would have been gone had I left him nothing to \u201ckeep\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou need watching, and watching over,\u201d he pursued; \u201cand it is well for you\r\nthat I see this, and do my best to discharge both duties. I watch you and\r\nothers pretty closely, pretty constantly, nearer and oftener than you or they\r\nthink. Do you see that window with a light in it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe pointed to a lattice in one of the college boarding-houses.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d said he, \u201cis a room I have hired, nominally for a study\u2014virtually for a\r\npost of observation. There I sit and read for hours together: it is my way\u2014my\r\ntaste. My book is this garden; its contents are human nature\u2014female human\r\nnature. I know you all by heart. Ah! I know you well\u2014St. Pierre, the\r\nParisienne\u2014cette ma\u00eetresse-femme, my cousin Beck herself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not right, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cComment? it is not right? By whose creed? Does some dogma of Calvin or Luther\r\ncondemn it? What is that to me? I am no Protestant. My rich father (for, though\r\nI have known poverty, and once starved for a year in a garret in Rome\u2014starved\r\nwretchedly, often on a meal a day, and sometimes not that\u2014yet I was born to\r\nwealth)\u2014my rich father was a good Catholic; and he gave me a priest and a\r\nJesuit for a tutor. I retain his lessons; and to what discoveries, grand Dieu!\r\nhave they not aided me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDiscoveries made by stealth seem to me dishonourable discoveries.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPuritaine! I doubt it not. Yet see how my Jesuit\u2019s system works. You know the\r\nSt. Pierre?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPartially.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe laughed. \u201cYou say right\u2014\u2018partially\u2019; whereas I know her\r\nthoroughly; there is the difference. She played before me the amiable;\r\noffered me patte de velours; caressed, flattered, fawned on me. Now, I am\r\naccessible to a woman\u2019s flattery\u2014accessible against my reason. Though never\r\npretty, she was\u2014when I first knew her\u2014young, or knew how to look young. Like\r\nall her countrywomen, she had the art of dressing\u2014she had a certain cool, easy,\r\nsocial assurance, which spared me the pain of embarrassment\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, that must have been unnecessary. I never saw you embarrassed in my\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, you know little of me; I can be embarrassed as a petite\r\npensionnaire; there is a fund of modesty and diffidence in my nature\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I never saw it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, it is there. You ought to have seen it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I have observed you in public\u2014on platforms, in tribunes, before\r\ntitles and crowned heads\u2014and you were as easy as you are in the third\r\ndivision.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, neither titles nor crowned heads excite my modesty; and\r\npublicity is very much my element. I like it well, and breathe in it quite\r\nfreely;\u2014but\u2014but, in short, here is the sentiment brought into action, at this\r\nvery moment; however, I disdain to be worsted by it. If, Mademoiselle, I were a\r\nmarrying man (which I am not; and you may spare yourself the trouble of any\r\nsneer you may be contemplating at the thought), and found it necessary to ask a\r\nlady whether she could look upon me in the light of a future husband, then\r\nwould it be proved that I am as I say\u2014modest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI quite believed him now; and, in believing, I honoured him with a sincerity of\r\nesteem which made my heart ache.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs to the St. Pierre,\u201d he went on, recovering himself, for his voice had\r\naltered a little, \u201cshe once intended to be Madame Emanuel; and I don\u2019t know\r\nwhither I might have been led, but for yonder little lattice with the light.\r\nAh, magic lattice! what miracles of discovery hast thou wrought! Yes,\u201d he\r\npursued, \u201cI have seen her rancours, her vanities, her levities\u2014not only here,\r\nbut elsewhere: I have witnessed what bucklers me against all her arts: I am\r\nsafe from poor Z\u00e9lie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd my pupils,\u201d he presently recommenced, \u201cthose blondes jeunes filles\u2014so mild\r\nand meek\u2014I have seen the most reserved\u2014romp like boys, the demurest\u2014snatch\r\ngrapes from the walls, shake pears from the trees. When the English teacher\r\ncame, I saw her, marked her early preference for this alley, noticed her taste\r\nfor seclusion, watched her well, long before she and I came to speaking terms;\r\ndo you recollect my once coming silently and offering you a little knot of\r\nwhite violets when we were strangers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI recollect it. I dried the violets, kept them, and have them still.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt pleased me when you took them peacefully and promptly, without prudery\u2014that\r\nsentiment which I ever dread to excite, and which, when it is revealed in eye\r\nor gesture, I vindictively detest. To return. Not only did I watch you;\r\nbut often\u2014especially at eventide\u2014another guardian angel was noiselessly\r\nhovering near: night after night my cousin Beck has stolen down yonder steps,\r\nand glidingly pursued your movements when you did not see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, Monsieur, you could not from the distance of that window see what passed\r\nin this garden at night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy moonlight I possibly might with a glass\u2014I use a glass\u2014but the garden itself\r\nis open to me. In the shed, at the bottom, there is a door leading into a\r\ncourt, which communicates with the college; of that door I possess the key, and\r\nthus come and go at pleasure. This afternoon I came through it, and found you\r\nasleep in classe; again this evening I have availed myself of the same\r\nentrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help saying, \u201cIf you were a wicked, designing man, how terrible\r\nwould all this be!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis attention seemed incapable of being arrested by this view of the subject:\r\nhe lit his cigar, and while he puffed it, leaning against a tree, and looking\r\nat me in a cool, amused way he had when his humour was tranquil, I thought\r\nproper to go on sermonizing him: he often lectured me by the hour together\u2014I\r\ndid not see why I should not speak my mind for once. So I told him my\r\nimpressions concerning his Jesuit-system.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe knowledge it brings you is bought too dear, Monsieur; this coming and\r\ngoing by stealth degrades your own dignity.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dignity!\u201d he cried, laughing; \u201cwhen did you ever see me trouble my head\r\nabout my dignity? It is you, Miss Lucy, who are \u2018digne.\u2019 How often, in your\r\nhigh insular presence, have I taken a pleasure in trampling upon, what you are\r\npleased to call, my dignity; tearing it, scattering it to the winds, in those\r\nmad transports you witness with such hauteur, and which I know you think very\r\nlike the ravings of a third-rate London actor.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I tell you every glance you cast from that lattice is a wrong done\r\nto the best part of your own nature. To study the human heart thus, is to\r\nbanquet secretly and sacrilegiously on Eve\u2019s apples. I wish you were a\r\nProtestant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIndifferent to the wish, he smoked on. After a space of smiling yet thoughtful\r\nsilence, he said, rather suddenly\u2014\u201cI have seen other things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat other things?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTaking the weed from his lips, he threw the remnant amongst the shrubs, where,\r\nfor a moment, it lay glowing in the gloom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook, at it,\u201d said he: \u201cis not that spark like an eye watching you and me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe took a turn down the walk; presently returning, he went on:\u2014\u201cI have seen,\r\nMiss Lucy, things to me unaccountable, that have made me watch all night for a\r\nsolution, and I have not yet found it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe tone was peculiar; my veins thrilled; he saw me shiver.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you afraid? Whether is it of my words or that red jealous eye just winking\r\nitself out?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am cold; the night grows dark and late, and the air is changed; it is time\r\nto go in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is little past eight, but you shall go in soon. Answer me only this\r\nquestion.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYet he paused ere he put it. The garden was truly growing dark; dusk had come\r\non with clouds, and drops of rain began to patter through the trees. I hoped he\r\nwould feel this, but, for the moment, he seemed too much absorbed to be\r\nsensible of the change.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, do you Protestants believe in the supernatural?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a difference of theory and belief on this point amongst Protestants\r\nas amongst other sects,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy, Monsieur, do you ask such a\r\nquestion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you shrink and speak so faintly? Are you superstitious?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am constitutionally nervous. I dislike the discussion of such subjects. I\r\ndislike it the more because\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou believe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: but it has happened to me to experience impressions\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSince you came here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; not many months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u2014in this house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBon! I am glad of it. I knew it, somehow; before you told me. I was conscious\r\nof rapport between you and myself. You are patient, and I am choleric; you are\r\nquiet and pale, and I am tanned and fiery; you are a strict Protestant, and I\r\nam a sort of lay Jesuit: but we are alike\u2014there is affinity between us. Do you\r\nsee it, Mademoiselle, when you look in the glass? Do you observe that your\r\nforehead is shaped like mine\u2014that your eyes are cut like mine? Do you hear that\r\nyou have some of my tones of voice? Do you know that you have many of my looks?\r\nI perceive all this, and believe that you were born under my star. Yes, you\r\nwere born under my star! Tremble! for where that is the case with mortals, the\r\nthreads of their destinies are difficult to disentangle; knottings and\r\ncatchings occur\u2014sudden breaks leave damage in the web. But these \u2018impressions,\u2019\r\nas you say, with English caution. I, too, have had my \u2018impressions.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, tell me them.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI desire no better, and intend no less. You know the legend of this house and\r\ngarden?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know it. Yes. They say that hundreds of years ago a nun was buried here\r\nalive at the foot of this very tree, beneath the ground which now bears us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd that in former days a nun\u2019s ghost used to come and go here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, what if it comes and goes here still?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSomething comes and goes here: there is a shape frequenting this house by\r\nnight, different to any forms that show themselves by day. I have indisputably\r\nseen a something, more than once; and to me its conventual weeds were a strange\r\nsight, saying more than they can do to any other living being. A nun!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I, too, have seen it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI anticipated that. Whether this nun be flesh and blood, or something that\r\nremains when blood is dried, and flesh is wasted, her business is as much with\r\nyou as with me, probably. Well, I mean to make it out; it has baffled me so\r\nfar, but I mean to follow up the mystery. I mean\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInstead of telling what he meant, he raised his head suddenly; I made the same\r\nmovement in the same instant; we both looked to one point\u2014the high tree\r\nshadowing the great berceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the\r\nfirst classe. There had been a strange and inexplicable sound from that\r\nquarter, as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their own motion, and its\r\nweight of foliage had rushed and crushed against the massive trunk. Yes; there\r\nscarce stirred a breeze, and that heavy tree was convulsed, whilst the feathery\r\nshrubs stood still. For some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and\r\nheaving went on. Dark as it was, it seemed to me that something more solid than\r\neither night-shadow, or branch-shadow, blackened out of the boles. At last the\r\nstruggle ceased. What birth succeeded this travail? What Dryad was born of\r\nthese throes? We watched fixedly. A sudden bell rang in the house\u2014the\r\nprayer-bell. Instantly into our alley there came, out of the berceau, an\r\napparition, all black and white. With a sort of angry rush-close, close past\r\nour faces\u2014swept swiftly the very NUN herself! Never had I seen her so clearly.\r\nShe looked tall of stature, and fierce of gesture. As she went, the wind rose\r\nsobbing; the rain poured wild and cold; the whole night seemed to feel her.\r\n\n"}
{"33": "\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nTHE FIRST LETTER.\n\r\nWhere, it becomes time to inquire, was Paulina Mary? How fared my intercourse\r\nwith the sumptuous H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy? That intercourse had, for an interval, been\r\nsuspended by absence; M. and Miss de Bassompierre had been travelling, dividing\r\nsome weeks between the provinces and capital of France. Chance apprised me of\r\ntheir return very shortly after it took place.\r\n\n\r\nI was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard, wandering slowly on,\r\nenjoying the benign April sun, and some thoughts not unpleasing, when I saw\r\nbefore me a group of riders, stopping as if they had just encountered, and\r\nexchanging greetings in the midst of the broad, smooth, linden-bordered path;\r\non one side a middle-aged gentleman and young lady, on the other\u2014a young and\r\nhandsome man. Very graceful was the lady\u2019s mien, choice her appointments,\r\ndelicate and stately her whole aspect. Still, as I looked, I felt they were\r\nknown to me, and, drawing a little nearer, I fully recognised them all: the\r\nCount Home de Bassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton.\r\n\n\r\nHow animated was Graham\u2019s face! How true, how warm, yet how retiring the joy it\r\nexpressed! This was the state of things, this the combination of circumstances,\r\nat once to attract and enchain, to subdue and excite Dr. John. The pearl he\r\nadmired was in itself of great price and truest purity, but he was not the man\r\nwho, in appreciating the gem, could forget its setting. Had he seen Paulina\r\nwith the same youth, beauty, and grace, but on foot, alone, unguarded, and in\r\nsimple attire, a dependent worker, a demi-grisette, he would have thought her a\r\npretty little creature, and would have loved with his eye her movements and her\r\nmien, but it required other than this to conquer him as he was now vanquished,\r\nto bring him safe under dominion as now, without loss, and even with gain to\r\nhis manly honour, one saw that he was reduced; there was about Dr. John all the\r\nman of the world; to satisfy himself did not suffice; society must approve\u2014the\r\nworld must admire what he did, or he counted his measures false and futile. In\r\nhis victrix he required all that was here visible\u2014the imprint of high\r\ncultivation, the consecration of a careful and authoritative protection, the\r\nadjuncts that Fashion decrees, Wealth purchases, and Taste adjusts; for these\r\nconditions his spirit stipulated ere it surrendered: they were here to the\r\nutmost fulfilled; and now, proud, impassioned, yet fearing, he did homage to\r\nPaulina as his sovereign. As for her, the smile of feeling, rather than of\r\nconscious power, slept soft in her eyes.\r\n\n\r\nThey parted. He passed me at speed, hardly feeling the earth he skimmed, and\r\nseeing nothing on either hand. He looked very handsome; mettle and purpose were\r\nroused in him fully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, there is Lucy!\u201d cried a musical, friendly voice. \u201cLucy, dear\r\nLucy\u2014do come here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hastened to her. She threw back her veil, and stooped from her saddle to kiss\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was coming to see you to-morrow,\u201d said she; \u201cbut now to-morrow you will come\r\nand see me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe named the hour, and I promised compliance.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow\u2019s evening found me with her\u2014she and I shut into her own room. I had\r\nnot seen her since that occasion when her claims were brought into comparison\r\nwith those of Ginevra Fanshawe, and had so signally prevailed; she had much to\r\ntell me of her travels in the interval. A most animated, rapid speaker was she\r\nin such a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, a most lively describer; yet with her artless diction\r\nand clear soft voice, she never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much. My\r\nown attention I think would not soon have flagged, but by-and-by, she herself\r\nseemed to need some change of subject; she hastened to wind up her narrative\r\nbriefly. Yet why she terminated with so concise an abridgment did not\r\nimmediately appear; silence followed\u2014a restless silence, not without symptoms\r\nof abstraction. Then, turning to me, in a diffident, half-appealing\r\nvoice\u2014\u201cLucy\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, I am at your side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs my cousin Ginevra still at Madame Beck\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour cousin is still there; you must be longing to see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou want to invite her to spend another evening?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I suppose she still talks about being married?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot to any one you care for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut of course she still thinks of Dr. Bretton? She cannot have changed her\r\nmind on that point, because it was so fixed two months ago.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you know, it does not matter. You saw the terms on which they stood.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little misunderstanding that evening, certainly; does she seem\r\nunhappy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot she. To change the subject. Have you heard or seen nothing of, or from,\r\nGraham during your absence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa had letters from him once or twice about business, I think. He undertook\r\nthe management of some affair which required attention while we were away. Dr.\r\nBretton seems to respect papa, and to have pleasure in obliging him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: you met him yesterday on the boulevard; you would be able to judge from\r\nhis aspect that his friends need not be painfully anxious about his health?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa seems to have thought with you. I could not help smiling. He is not\r\nparticularly observant, you know, because he is often thinking of other things\r\nthan what pass before his eyes; but he said, as Dr. Bretton rode away, \u2018Really\r\nit does a man good to see the spirit and energy of that boy.\u2019 He called Dr.\r\nBretton a boy; I believe he almost thinks him so, just as he thinks me a little\r\ngirl; he was not speaking to me, but dropped that remark to himself. Lucy\u2026.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain fell the appealing accent, and at the same instant she left her chair,\r\nand came and sat on the stool at my feet.\r\n\n\r\nI liked her. It is not a declaration I have often made concerning my\r\nacquaintance, in the course of this book: the reader will bear with it for\r\nonce. Intimate intercourse, close inspection, disclosed in Paulina only what\r\nwas delicate, intelligent, and sincere; therefore my regard for her lay deep.\r\nAn admiration more superficial might have been more demonstrative; mine,\r\nhowever, was quiet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to ask of Lucy?\u201d said I; \u201cbe brave, and speak out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut there was no courage in her eye; as it met mine, it fell; and there was no\r\ncoolness on her cheek\u2014not a transient surface-blush, but a gathering inward\r\nexcitement raised its tint and its temperature.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I do wish to know your thoughts of Dr. Bretton. Do, do\r\ngive me your real opinion of his character, his disposition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis character stands high, and deservedly high.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd his disposition? Tell me about his disposition,\u201d she urged; \u201cyou know him\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know him pretty well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know his home-side. You have seen him with his mother; speak of him as a\r\nson.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is a fine-hearted son; his mother\u2019s comfort and hope, her pride and\r\npleasure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe held my hand between hers, and at each favourable word gave it a little\r\ncaressing stroke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn what other way is he good, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton is benevolent\u2014humanely disposed towards all his race, Dr. Bretton\r\nwould have benignity for the lowest savage, or the worst criminal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI heard some gentlemen, some of papa\u2019s friends, who were talking about him,\r\nsay the same. They say many of the poor patients at the hospitals, who tremble\r\nbefore some pitiless and selfish surgeons, welcome him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are right; I have witnessed as much. He once took me over a hospital; I\r\nsaw how he was received: your father\u2019s friends are right.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe softest gratitude animated her eye as she lifted it a moment. She had yet\r\nmore to say, but seemed hesitating about time and place. Dusk was beginning to\r\nreign; her parlour fire already glowed with twilight ruddiness; but I thought\r\nshe wished the room dimmer, the hour later.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow quiet and secluded we feel here!\u201d I remarked, to reassure her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo we? Yes; it is a still evening, and I shall not be called down to tea; papa\r\nis dining out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStill holding my hand, she played with the fingers unconsciously, dressed them,\r\nnow in her own rings, and now circled them with a twine of her beautiful hair;\r\nshe patted the palm against her hot cheek, and at last, having cleared a voice\r\nthat was naturally liquid as a lark\u2019s, she said:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou must think it rather strange that I should talk so much about Dr. Bretton,\r\nask so many questions, take such an interest, but\u2014\u201d.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot at all strange; perfectly natural; you like him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I did,\u201d said she, with slight quickness, \u201cis that a reason why I should\r\ntalk? I suppose you think me weak, like my cousin Ginevra?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I thought you one whit like Madame Ginevra, I would not sit here waiting\r\nfor your communications. I would get up, walk at my ease about the room, and\r\nanticipate all you had to say by a round lecture. Go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean to go on,\u201d retorted she; \u201cwhat else do you suppose I mean to do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she looked and spoke\u2014the little Polly of Bretton\u2014petulant, sensitive.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf,\u201d said she, emphatically, \u201cif I liked Dr. John till I was fit to die for\r\nliking him, that alone could not license me to be otherwise than dumb\u2014dumb as\r\nthe grave\u2014dumb as you, Lucy Snowe\u2014you know it\u2014and you know you would despise me\r\nif I failed in self-control, and whined about some rickety liking that was all\r\non my side.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is true I little respect women or girls who are loquacious either in\r\nboasting the triumphs, or bemoaning the mortifications, of feelings. But as to\r\nyou, Paulina, speak, for I earnestly wish to hear you. Tell me all it will give\r\nyou pleasure or relief to tell: I ask no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you care for me, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do, Paulina.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I love you. I had an odd content in being with you even when I was a\r\nlittle, troublesome, disobedient girl; it was charming to me then to lavish on\r\nyou my naughtiness and whims. Now you are acceptable to me, and I like to talk\r\nwith and trust you. So listen, Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd she settled herself, resting against my arm\u2014resting gently, not with honest\r\nMistress Fanshawe\u2019s fatiguing and selfish weight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA few minutes since you asked whether we had not heard from Graham during our\r\nabsence, and I said there were two letters for papa on business; this was true,\r\nbut I did not tell you all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou evaded?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shuffled and equivocated, you know. However, I am going to speak the truth\r\nnow; it is getting darker; one can talk at one\u2019s ease. Papa often lets me open\r\nthe letter-bag and give him out the contents. One morning, about three weeks\r\nago, you don\u2019t know how surprised I was to find, amongst a dozen letters for M.\r\nde Bassompierre, a note addressed to Miss de Bassompierre. I spied it at once,\r\namidst all the rest; the handwriting was not strange; it attracted me directly.\r\nI was going to say, \u2018Papa, here is another letter from Dr. Bretton;\u2019 but the\r\n\u2018Miss\u2019 struck me mute. I actually never received a letter from a gentleman\r\nbefore. Ought I to have shown it to papa, and let him open it and read it\r\nfirst? I could not for my life, Lucy. I know so well papa\u2019s ideas about me: he\r\nforgets my age; he thinks I am a mere school-girl; he is not aware that other\r\npeople see I am grown up as tall as I shall be; so, with a curious mixture of\r\nfeelings, some of them self-reproachful, and some so fluttering and strong, I\r\ncannot describe them, I gave papa his twelve letters\u2014his herd of\r\npossessions\u2014and kept back my one, my ewe-lamb. It lay in my lap during\r\nbreakfast, looking up at me with an inexplicable meaning, making me feel myself\r\na thing double-existent\u2014a child to that dear papa, but no more a child to\r\nmyself. After breakfast I carried my letter up-stairs, and having secured\r\nmyself by turning the key in the door, I began to study the outside of my\r\ntreasure: it was some minutes before I could get over the direction and\r\npenetrate the seal; one does not take a strong place of this kind by instant\r\nstorm\u2014one sits down awhile before it, as beleaguers say. Graham\u2019s hand is like\r\nhimself, Lucy, and so is his seal\u2014all clear, firm, and rounded\u2014no slovenly\r\nsplash of wax\u2014a full, solid, steady drop\u2014a distinct impress; no pointed turns\r\nharshly pricking the optic nerve, but a clean, mellow, pleasant manuscript,\r\nthat soothes you as you read. It is like his face\u2014just like the chiselling of\r\nhis features: do you know his autograph?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have seen it: go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe seal was too beautiful to be broken, so I cut it round with my scissors.\r\nOn the point of reading the letter at last, I once more drew back voluntarily;\r\nit was too soon yet to drink that draught\u2014the sparkle in the cup was so\r\nbeautiful\u2014I would watch it yet a minute. Then I remembered all at once that I\r\nhad not said my prayers that morning. Having heard papa go down to breakfast a\r\nlittle earlier than usual, I had been afraid of keeping him waiting, and had\r\nhastened to join him as soon as dressed, thinking no harm to put off prayers\r\ntill afterwards. Some people would say I ought to have served God first and\r\nthen man; but I don\u2019t think heaven could be jealous of anything I might do for\r\npapa. I believe I am superstitious. A voice seemed now to say that another\r\nfeeling than filial affection was in question\u2014to urge me to pray before I dared\r\nto read what I so longed to read\u2014to deny myself yet a moment, and remember\r\nfirst a great duty. I have had these impulses ever since I can remember. I put\r\nthe letter down and said my prayers, adding, at the end, a strong entreaty that\r\nwhatever happened, I might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow, and\r\nmight never, in caring for others, neglect him. The very thought of such a\r\npossibility, so pierced my heart that it made me cry. But still, Lucy, I felt\r\nthat in time papa would have to be taught the truth, managed, and induced to\r\nhear reason.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI read the letter. Lucy, life is said to be all disappointment. I was\r\nnot disappointed. Ere I read, and while I read, my heart did more than throb\u2014it\r\ntrembled fast\u2014every quiver seemed like the pant of an animal athirst, laid down\r\nat a well and drinking; and the well proved quite full, gloriously clear; it\r\nrose up munificently of its own impulse; I saw the sun through its gush, and\r\nnot a mote, Lucy, no moss, no insect, no atom in the thrice-refined golden\r\ngurgle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLife,\u201d she went on, \u201cis said to be full of pain to some. I have read\r\nbiographies where the wayfarer seemed to journey on from suffering to\r\nsuffering; where Hope flew before him fast, never alighting so near, or\r\nlingering so long, as to give his hand a chance of one realizing grasp. I have\r\nread of those who sowed in tears, and whose harvest, so far from being reaped\r\nin joy, perished by untimely blight, or was borne off by sudden whirlwind; and,\r\nalas! some of these met the winter with empty garners, and died of utter want\r\nin the darkest and coldest of the year.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it their fault, Paulina, that they of whom you speak thus died?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot always their fault. Some of them were good endeavouring people. I am not\r\nendeavouring, nor actively good, yet God has caused me to grow in sun, due\r\nmoisture, and safe protection, sheltered, fostered, taught, by my dear father;\r\nand now\u2014now\u2014another comes. Graham loves me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor some minutes we both paused on this climax.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes your father know?\u201d I inquired, in a low voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham spoke with deep respect of papa, but implied that he dared not approach\r\nthat quarter as yet; he must first prove his worth: he added that he must have\r\nsome light respecting myself and my own feelings ere he ventured to risk a step\r\nin the matter elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow did you reply?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI replied briefly, but I did not repulse him. Yet I almost trembled for fear\r\nof making the answer too cordial: Graham\u2019s tastes are so fastidious. I wrote it\r\nthree times\u2014chastening and subduing the phrases at every rescript; at last,\r\nhaving confected it till it seemed to me to resemble a morsel of ice flavoured\r\nwith ever so slight a zest of fruit or sugar, I ventured to seal and despatch\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcellent, Paulina! Your instinct is fine; you understand Dr. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how must I manage about papa? There I am still in pain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not manage at all. Wait now. Only maintain no further correspondence till\r\nyour father knows all, and gives his sanction.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill he ever give it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTime will show. Wait.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton wrote one other letter, deeply grateful for my calm, brief note;\r\nbut I anticipated your advice, by saying, that while my sentiments continued\r\nthe same, I could not, without my father\u2019s knowledge, write again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou acted as you ought to have done; so Dr. Bretton will feel: it will\r\nincrease his pride in you, his love for you, if either be capable of increase.\r\nPaulina, that gentle hoar-frost of yours, surrounding so much pure, fine flame,\r\nis a priceless privilege of nature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou see I feel Graham\u2019s disposition,\u201d said she. \u201cI feel that no delicacy can\r\nbe too exquisite for his treatment.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is perfectly proved that you comprehend him, and then\u2014whatever Dr.\r\nBretton\u2019s disposition, were he one who expected to be more nearly met\u2014you would\r\nstill act truthfully, openly, tenderly, with your father.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I trust I shall thus act always. Oh, it will be pain to wake papa from\r\nhis dream, and tell him I am no more a little girl!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe in no hurry to do so, Paulina. Leave the revelation to Time and your kind\r\nFate. I also have noticed the gentleness of her cares for you: doubt not she\r\nwill benignantly order the circumstances, and fitly appoint the hour. Yes: I\r\nhave thought over your life just as you have yourself thought it over; I have\r\nmade comparisons like those to which you adverted. We know not the future, but\r\nthe past has been propitious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs a child I feared for you; nothing that has life was ever more susceptible\r\nthan your nature in infancy: under harshness or neglect, neither your outward\r\nnor your inward self would have ripened to what they now are. Much pain, much\r\nfear, much struggle, would have troubled the very lines of your features,\r\nbroken their regularity, would have harassed your nerves into the fever of\r\nhabitual irritation; you would have lost in health and cheerfulness, in grace\r\nand sweetness. Providence has protected and cultured you, not only for your own\r\nsake, but I believe for Graham\u2019s. His star, too, was fortunate: to develop\r\nfully the best of his nature, a companion like you was needed: there you are,\r\nready. You must be united. I knew it the first day I saw you together at La\r\nTerrasse. In all that mutually concerns you and Graham there seems to me\r\npromise, plan, harmony. I do not think the sunny youth of either will prove the\r\nforerunner of stormy age. I think it is deemed good that you two should live in\r\npeace and be happy\u2014not as angels, but as few are happy amongst mortals. Some\r\nlives are thus blessed: it is God\u2019s will: it is the attesting trace and\r\nlingering evidence of Eden. Other lives run from the first another course.\r\nOther travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty, wild and variable\u2014breast\r\nadverse winds, are belated and overtaken by the early closing winter night.\r\nNeither can this happen without the sanction of God; and I know that, amidst\r\nHis boundless works, is somewhere stored the secret of this last fate\u2019s\r\njustice: I know that His treasures contain the proof as the promise of its\r\nmercy.\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"34": "\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nM. PAUL KEEPS HIS PROMISE.\n\r\nOn the first of May, we had all\u2014i.e. the twenty boarders and the four\r\nteachers\u2014notice to rise at five o\u2019clock of the morning, to be dressed and ready\r\nby six, to put ourselves under the command of M. le Professeur Emanuel, who was\r\nto head our march forth from Villette, for it was on this day he proposed to\r\nfulfil his promise of taking us to breakfast in the country. I, indeed, as the\r\nreader may perhaps remember, had not had the honour of an invitation when this\r\nexcursion was first projected\u2014rather the contrary; but on my now making\r\nallusion to this fact, and wishing to know how it was to be, my ear received a\r\npull, of which I did not venture to challenge the repetition by raising,\r\nfurther difficulties.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vous conseille de vous faire prier,\u201d said M. Emanuel, imperially menacing\r\nthe other ear. One Napoleonic compliment, however, was enough, so I made up my\r\nmind to be of the party.\r\n\n\r\nThe morning broke calm as summer, with singing of birds in the garden, and a\r\nlight dew-mist that promised heat. We all said it would be warm, and we all\r\nfelt pleasure in folding away heavy garments, and in assuming the attire\r\nsuiting a sunny season. The clean fresh print dress, and the light straw\r\nbonnet, each made and trimmed as the French workwoman alone can make and trim,\r\nso as to unite the utterly unpretending with the perfectly becoming, was the\r\nrule of costume. Nobody flaunted in faded silk; nobody wore a second-hand best\r\narticle.\r\n\n\r\nAt six the bell rang merrily, and we poured down the staircase, through the\r\ncarr\u00e9, along the corridor, into the vestibule. There stood our Professor,\r\nwearing, not his savage-looking palet\u00f4t and severe bonnet-grec, but a\r\nyoung-looking belted blouse and cheerful straw hat. He had for us all the\r\nkindest good-morrow, and most of us for him had a thanksgiving smile. We were\r\nmarshalled in order and soon started.\r\n\n\r\nThe streets were yet quiet, and the boulevards were fresh and peaceful as\r\nfields. I believe we were very happy as we walked along. This chief of ours had\r\nthe secret of giving a certain impetus to happiness when he would; just as, in\r\nan opposite mood, he could give a thrill to fear.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not lead nor follow us, but walked along the line, giving a word to\r\nevery one, talking much to his favourites, and not wholly neglecting even those\r\nhe disliked. It was rather my wish, for a reason I had, to keep slightly aloof\r\nfrom notice, and being paired with Ginevra Fanshawe, bearing on my arm the dear\r\npressure of that angel\u2019s not unsubstantial limb\u2014(she continued in excellent\r\ncase, and I can assure the reader it was no trifling business to bear the\r\nburden of her loveliness; many a time in the course of that warm day I wished\r\nto goodness there had been less of the charming commodity)\u2014however, having her,\r\nas I said, I tried to make her useful by interposing her always between myself\r\nand M. Paul, shifting my place, according as I heard him coming up to the right\r\nhand or the left. My private motive for this man\u0153uvre might be traced to the\r\ncircumstance of the new print dress I wore, being pink in colour\u2014a fact which,\r\nunder our present convoy, made me feel something as I have felt, when, clad in\r\na shawl with a red border, necessitated to traverse a meadow where pastured a\r\nbull.\r\n\n\r\nFor awhile, the shifting system, together with some modifications in the\r\narrangement of a black silk scarf, answered my purpose; but, by-and-by, he\r\nfound out, that whether he came to this side or to that, Miss Fanshawe was\r\nstill his neighbour. The course of acquaintance between Ginevra and him had\r\nnever run so smooth that his temper did not undergo a certain crisping process\r\nwhenever he heard her English accent: nothing in their dispositions fitted;\r\nthey jarred if they came in contact; he held her empty and affected; she deemed\r\nhim bearish, meddling, repellent.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, when he had changed his place for about the sixth time, finding still\r\nthe same untoward result to the experiment\u2014he thrust his head forward, settled\r\nhis eyes on mine, and demanded with impatience, \u201cQu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est? Vous me\r\njouez des tours?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, however, ere, with his customary\r\nquickness, he seized the root of this proceeding: in vain I shook out the long\r\nfringe, and spread forth the broad end of my scarf. \u201cA-h-h! c\u2019est la robe\r\nrose!\u201d broke from his lips, affecting me very much like the sudden and irate\r\nlow of some lord of the meadow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is only cotton,\u201d I alleged, hurriedly; \u201cand cheaper, and washes better than\r\nany other colour.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt Mademoiselle Lucy est coquette comme dix Parisiennes,\u201d he answered. \u201cA-t-on\r\njamais vu une Anglaise pareille. Regardez plut\u00f4t son chapeau, et ses gants, et\r\nses brodequins!\u201d These articles of dress were just like what my companions\r\nwore; certainly not one whit smarter\u2014perhaps rather plainer than most\u2014but\r\nMonsieur had now got hold of his text, and I began to chafe under the expected\r\nsermon. It went off, however, as mildly as the menace of a storm sometimes\r\npasses on a summer day. I got but one flash of sheet lightning in the shape of\r\na single bantering smile from his eyes; and then he said, \u201cCourage!\u2014\u00e0 vrai dire\r\nje ne suis pas f\u00e2ch\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame suis je content qu\u2019on s\u2019est fait si belle\r\npour ma petite f\u00eate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais ma robe n\u2019est pas belle, Monsieur\u2014elle n\u2019est que propre.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJ\u2019aime la propret\u00e9,\u201d said he. In short, he was not to be dissatisfied; the sun\r\nof good humour was to triumph on this auspicious morning; it consumed scudding\r\nclouds ere they sullied its disk.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now we were in the country, amongst what they called \u201cles bois et les\r\npetits sentiers.\u201d These woods and lanes a month later would offer but a dusty\r\nand doubtful seclusion: now, however, in their May greenness and morning\r\nrepose, they looked very pleasant.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached a certain well, planted round, in the taste of Labassecour, with an\r\norderly circle of lime-trees: here a halt was called; on the green swell of\r\nground surrounding this well, we were ordered to be seated, Monsieur taking his\r\nplace in our midst, and suffering us to gather in a knot round him. Those who\r\nliked him more than they feared, came close, and these were chiefly little\r\nones; those who feared more than they liked, kept somewhat aloof; those in whom\r\nmuch affection had given, even to what remained of fear, a pleasurable zest,\r\nobserved the greatest distance.\r\n\n\r\nHe began to tell us a story. Well could he narrate: in such a diction as\r\nchildren love, and learned men emulate; a diction simple in its strength, and\r\nstrong in its simplicity. There were beautiful touches in that little tale;\r\nsweet glimpses of feeling and hues of description that, while I listened, sunk\r\ninto my mind, and since have never faded. He tinted a twilight scene\u2014I hold it\r\nin memory still\u2014such a picture I have never looked on from artist\u2019s pencil.\r\n\n\r\nI have said, that, for myself, I had no impromptu faculty; and perhaps that\r\nvery deficiency made me marvel the more at one who possessed it in perfection.\r\nM. Emanuel was not a man to write books; but I have heard him lavish, with\r\ncareless, unconscious prodigality, such mental wealth as books seldom boast;\r\nhis mind was indeed my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I entered\r\nbliss. Intellectually imperfect as I was, I could read little; there were few\r\nbound and printed volumes that did not weary me\u2014whose perusal did not fag and\r\nblind\u2014but his tomes of thought were collyrium to the spirit\u2019s eyes; over their\r\ncontents, inward sight grew clear and strong. I used to think what a delight it\r\nwould be for one who loved him better than he loved himself, to gather and\r\nstore up those handfuls of gold-dust, so recklessly flung to heaven\u2019s reckless\r\nwinds.\r\n\n\r\nHis story done, he approached the little knoll where I and Ginevra sat apart.\r\nIn his usual mode of demanding an opinion (he had not reticence to wait till it\r\nwas voluntarily offered) he asked, \u201cWere you interested?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAccording to my wonted undemonstrative fashion, I simply answered\u2014\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it good?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYet I could not write that down,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hate the mechanical labour; I hate to stoop and sit still. I could dictate\r\nit, though, with pleasure, to an amanuensis who suited me. Would Mademoiselle\r\nLucy write for me if I asked her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur would be too quick; he would urge me, and be angry if my pen did not\r\nkeep pace with his lips.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTry some day; let us see the monster I can make of myself under the\r\ncircumstances. But just now, there is no question of dictation; I mean to make\r\nyou useful in another office. Do you see yonder farm-house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurrounded with trees? Yes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere we are to breakfast; and while the good fermi\u00e8re makes the caf\u00e9 au lait\r\nin a caldron, you and five others, whom I shall select, will spread with butter\r\nhalf a hundred rolls.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHaving formed his troop into line once more, he marched us straight on the\r\nfarm, which, on seeing our force, surrendered without capitulation.\r\n\n\r\nClean knives and plates, and fresh butter being provided, half-a-dozen of us,\r\nchosen by our Professor, set to work under his directions, to prepare for\r\nbreakfast a huge basket of rolls, with which the baker had been ordered to\r\nprovision the farm, in anticipation of our coming. Coffee and chocolate were\r\nalready made hot; cream and new-laid eggs were added to the treat, and M.\r\nEmanuel, always generous, would have given a large order for \u201cjambon\u201d and\r\n\u201cconfitures\u201d in addition, but that some of us, who presumed perhaps upon our\r\ninfluence, insisted that it would be a most reckless waste of victual. He\r\nrailed at us for our pains, terming us \u201cdes m\u00e9nag\u00e8res avares;\u201d but we let him\r\ntalk, and managed the economy of the repast our own way.\r\n\n\r\nWith what a pleasant countenance he stood on the farm-kitchen hearth looking\r\non! He was a man whom it made happy to see others happy; he liked to have\r\nmovement, animation, abundance and enjoyment round him. We asked where he would\r\nsit. He told us, we knew well he was our slave, and we his tyrants, and that he\r\ndared not so much as choose a chair without our leave; so we set him the\r\nfarmer\u2019s great chair at the head of the long table, and put him into it.\r\n\n\r\nWell might we like him, with all his passions and hurricanes, when he could be\r\nso benignant and docile at times, as he was just now. Indeed, at the worst, it\r\nwas only his nerves that were irritable, not his temper that was radically bad;\r\nsoothe, comprehend, comfort him, and he was a lamb; he would not harm a fly.\r\nOnly to the very stupid, perverse, or unsympathizing, was he in the slightest\r\ndegree dangerous.\r\n\n\r\nMindful always of his religion, he made the youngest of the party say a little\r\nprayer before we began breakfast, crossing himself as devotedly as a woman. I\r\nhad never seen him pray before, or make that pious sign; he did it so simply,\r\nwith such child-like faith, I could not help smiling pleasurably as I watched;\r\nhis eyes met my smile; he just stretched out his kind hand, saying, \u201cDonnez-moi\r\nla main! I see we worship the same God, in the same spirit, though by different\r\nrites.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMost of M. Emanuel\u2019s brother Professors were emancipated free-thinkers,\r\ninfidels, atheists; and many of them men whose lives would not bear scrutiny;\r\nhe was more like a knight of old, religious in his way, and of spotless fame.\r\nInnocent childhood, beautiful youth were safe at his side. He had vivid\r\npassions, keen feelings, but his pure honour and his artless piety were the\r\nstrong charm that kept the lions couchant.\r\n\n\r\nThat breakfast was a merry meal, and the merriment was not mere vacant clatter:\r\nM. Paul originated, led, controlled and heightened it; his social, lively\r\ntemper played unfettered and unclouded; surrounded only by women and children\r\nthere was nothing to cross and thwart him; he had his own way, and a pleasant\r\nway it was.\r\n\n\r\nThe meal over, the party were free to run and play in the meadows; a few stayed\r\nto help the farmer\u2019s wife to put away her earthenware. M. Paul called me from\r\namong these to come out and sit near him under a tree\u2014whence he could view the\r\ntroop gambolling, over a wide pasture\u2014and read to him whilst he took his cigar.\r\nHe sat on a rustic bench, and I at the tree-root. While I read (a\r\npocket-classic\u2014a Corneille\u2014I did not like it, but he did, finding therein\r\nbeauties I never could be brought to perceive), he listened with a sweetness of\r\ncalm the more impressive from the impetuosity of his general nature; the\r\ndeepest happiness filled his blue eye and smoothed his broad forehead. I, too,\r\nwas happy\u2014happy with the bright day, happier with his presence, happiest with\r\nhis kindness.\r\n\n\r\nHe asked, by-and-by, if I would not rather run to my companions than sit there?\r\nI said, no; I felt content to be where he was. He asked whether, if I were his\r\nsister, I should always be content to stay with a brother such as he. I said, I\r\nbelieved I should; and I felt it. Again, he inquired whether, if he were to\r\nleave Villette, and go far away, I should be sorry; and I dropped Corneille,\r\nand made no reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite s\u0153ur,\u201d said he; \u201chow long could you remember me if we were separated?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat, Monsieur, I can never tell, because I do not know how long it will be\r\nbefore I shall cease to remember everything earthly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to go beyond seas for two\u2014three\u2014five years, should you welcome me on\r\nmy return?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, how could I live in the interval?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPourtant j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pour vous bien dur, bien exigeant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hid my face with the book, for it was covered with tears. I asked him why he\r\ntalked so; and he said he would talk so no more, and cheered me again with the\r\nkindest encouragement. Still, the gentleness with which he treated me during\r\nthe rest of the day, went somehow to my heart. It was too tender. It was\r\nmournful. I would rather he had been abrupt, whimsical, and irate as was his\r\nwont.\r\n\n\r\nWhen hot noon arrived\u2014for the day turned out as we had anticipated, glowing as\r\nJune\u2014our shepherd collected his sheep from the pasture, and proceeded to lead\r\nus all softly home. But we had a whole league to walk, thus far from Villette\r\nwas the farm where he had breakfasted; the children, especially, were tired\r\nwith their play; the spirits of most flagged at the prospect of this mid-day\r\nwalk over chauss\u00e9es flinty, glaring, and dusty. This state of things had been\r\nforeseen and provided for. Just beyond the boundary of the farm we met two\r\nspacious vehicles coming to fetch us\u2014such conveyances as are hired out\r\npurposely for the accommodation of school-parties; here, with good management,\r\nroom was found for all, and in another hour M. Paul made safe consignment of\r\nhis charge at the Rue Fossette. It had been a pleasant day: it would have been\r\nperfect, but for the breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its sunshine a\r\nmoment.\r\n\n\r\nThat tarnish was renewed the same evening.\r\n\n\r\nJust about sunset, I saw M. Emanuel come out of the front-door, accompanied by\r\nMadame Beck. They paced the centre-alley for nearly an hour, talking earnestly:\r\nhe\u2014looking grave, yet restless; she\u2014wearing an amazed, expostulatory,\r\ndissuasive air.\r\n\n\r\nI wondered what was under discussion; and when Madame Beck re-entered the house\r\nas it darkened, leaving her kinsman Paul yet lingering in the garden, I said to\r\nmyself\u2014\u201cHe called me \u2018petite s\u0153ur\u2019 this morning. If he were really my brother,\r\nhow I should like to go to him just now, and ask what it is that presses on his\r\nmind. See how he leans against that tree, with his arms crossed and his brow\r\nbent. He wants consolation, I know: Madame does not console: she only\r\nremonstrates. What now\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStarting from quiescence to action, M. Paul came striding erect and quick down\r\nthe garden. The carr\u00e9 doors were yet open: I thought he was probably going to\r\nwater the orange-trees in the tubs, after his occasional custom; on reaching\r\nthe court, however, he took an abrupt turn and made for the berceau and the\r\nfirst-classe glass door. There, in that first classe I was, thence I had been\r\nwatching him; but there I could not find courage to await his approach. He had\r\nturned so suddenly, he strode so fast, he looked so strange; the coward within\r\nme grew pale, shrank and\u2014not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing the\r\nshrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his advance\u2014she was gone on the wings of\r\npanic.\r\n\n\r\nNor did I pause till I had taken sanctuary in the oratory, now empty. Listening\r\nthere with beating pulses, and an unaccountable, undefined apprehension, I\r\nheard him pass through all the schoolrooms, clashing the doors impatiently as\r\nhe went; I heard him invade the refectory which the \u201clecture pieuse\u201d was now\r\nholding under hallowed constraint; I heard him pronounce these words\u2014\u201cO\u00f9 est\r\nMademoiselle Lucie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd just as, summoning my courage, I was preparing to go down and do what,\r\nafter all, I most wished to do in the world\u2014viz., meet him\u2014the wiry voice of\r\nSt. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, \u201cElle est au lit.\u201d And he passed, with\r\nthe stamp of vexation, into the corridor. There Madame Beck met, captured,\r\nchid, convoyed to the street-door, and finally dismissed him.\r\n\n\r\nAs that street-door closed, a sudden amazement at my own perverse proceeding\r\nstruck like a blow upon me. I felt from the first it was me he wanted\u2014me he was\r\nseeking\u2014and had not I wanted him too? What, then, had carried me away? What had\r\nrapt me beyond his reach? He had something to tell: he was going to tell me\r\nthat something: my ear strained its nerve to hear it, and I had made the\r\nconfidence impossible. Yearning to listen and console, while I thought audience\r\nand solace beyond hope\u2019s reach\u2014no sooner did opportunity suddenly and fully\r\narrive, than I evaded it as I would have evaded the levelled shaft of\r\nmortality.\r\n\n\r\nWell, my insane inconsistency had its reward. Instead of the comfort, the\r\ncertain satisfaction, I might have won\u2014could I but have put choking panic down,\r\nand stood firm two minutes\u2014here was dead blank, dark doubt, and drear suspense.\r\n\n\r\nI took my wages to my pillow, and passed the night counting them.\r\n\n"}
{"35": "\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nMALEVOLA.\n\r\nMadame Beck called me on Thursday afternoon, and asked whether I had any\r\noccupation to hinder me from going into town and executing some little\r\ncommissions for her at the shops.\r\n\n\r\nBeing disengaged, and placing myself at her service, I was presently furnished\r\nwith a list of the wools, silks, embroidering thread, etcetera, wanted in the\r\npupils\u2019 work, and having equipped myself in a manner suiting the threatening\r\naspect of a cloudy and sultry day, I was just drawing the spring-bolt of the\r\nstreet-door, in act to issue forth, when Madame\u2019s voice again summoned me to\r\nthe salle-\u00e0-manger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPardon, Meess Lucie!\u201d cried she, in the seeming haste of an impromptu thought,\r\n\u201cI have just recollected one more errand for you, if your good-nature will not\r\ndeem itself over-burdened?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOf course I \u201cconfounded myself\u201d in asseverations to the contrary; and Madame,\r\nrunning into the little salon, brought thence a pretty basket, filled with fine\r\nhothouse fruit, rosy, perfect, and tempting, reposing amongst the dark green,\r\nwax-like leaves, and pale yellow stars of, I know not what, exotic plant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, \u201cit is not heavy, and will not shame your neat toilette, as\r\nif it were a household, servant-like detail. Do me the favour to leave this\r\nlittle basket at the house of Madame Walravens, with my felicitations on her\r\nf\u00eate. She lives down in the old town, Num\u00e9ro 3, Rue des Mages. I fear you will\r\nfind the walk rather long, but you have the whole afternoon before you, and do\r\nnot hurry; if you are not back in time for dinner, I will order a portion to be\r\nsaved, or Goton, with whom you are a favourite, will have pleasure in tossing\r\nup some trifle, for your especial benefit. You shall not be forgotten, ma bonne\r\nMeess. And oh! please!\u201d (calling me back once more) \u201cbe sure to insist on\r\nseeing Madame Walravens herself, and giving the basket into her own hands, in\r\norder that there may be no mistake, for she is rather a punctilious personage.\r\nAdieu! Au revoir!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd at last I got away. The shop commissions took some time to execute, that\r\nchoosing and matching of silks and wools being always a tedious business, but\r\nat last I got through my list. The patterns for the slippers, the bell-ropes,\r\nthe cabas were selected\u2014the slides and tassels for the purses chosen\u2014the whole\r\n\u201ctripotage,\u201d in short, was off my mind; nothing but the fruit and the\r\nfelicitations remained to be attended to.\r\n\n\r\nI rather liked the prospect of a long walk, deep into the old and grim\r\nBasse-Ville; and I liked it no worse because the evening sky, over the city,\r\nwas settling into a mass of black-blue metal, heated at the rim, and inflaming\r\nslowly to a heavy red.\r\n\n\r\nI fear a high wind, because storm demands that exertion of strength and use of\r\naction I always yield with pain; but the sullen down-fall, the thick\r\nsnow-descent, or dark rush of rain, ask only resignation\u2014the quiet abandonment\r\nof garments and person to be drenched. In return, it sweeps a great capital\r\nclean before you; it makes you a quiet path through broad, grand streets; it\r\npetrifies a living city as if by eastern enchantment; it transforms a Villette\r\ninto a Tadmor. Let, then, the rains fall, and the floods descend\u2014only I must\r\nfirst get rid of this basket of fruit.\r\n\n\r\nAn unknown clock from an unknown tower (Jean Baptiste\u2019s voice was now too\r\ndistant to be audible) was tolling the third quarter past five, when I reached\r\nthat street and house whereof Madame Beck had given me the address. It was no\r\nstreet at all; it seemed rather to be part of a square: it was quiet, grass\r\ngrew between the broad grey flags, the houses were large and looked very\r\nold\u2014behind them rose the appearance of trees, indicating gardens at the back.\r\nAntiquity brooded above this region, business was banished thence. Rich men had\r\nonce possessed this quarter, and once grandeur had made her seat here. That\r\nchurch, whose dark, half-ruinous turrets overlooked the square, was the\r\nvenerable and formerly opulent shrine of the Magi. But wealth and greatness had\r\nlong since stretched their gilded pinions and fled hence, leaving these their\r\nancient nests, perhaps to house Penury for a time, or perhaps to stand cold and\r\nempty, mouldering untenanted in the course of winters.\r\n\n\r\nAs I crossed this deserted \u201cplace,\u201d on whose pavement drops almost as large as\r\na five-franc piece were now slowly darkening, I saw, in its whole expanse, no\r\nsymptom or evidence of life, except what was given in the figure of an infirm\r\nold priest, who went past, bending and propped on a staff\u2014the type of eld and\r\ndecay.\r\n\n\r\nHe had issued from the very house to which I was directed; and when I paused\r\nbefore the door just closed after him, and rang the bell, he turned to look at\r\nme. Nor did he soon avert his gaze; perhaps he thought me, with my basket of\r\nsummer fruit, and my lack of the dignity age confers, an incongruous figure in\r\nsuch a scene. I know, had a young ruddy-faced bonne opened the door to admit\r\nme, I should have thought such a one little in harmony with her dwelling; but,\r\nwhen I found myself confronted by a very old woman, wearing a very antique\r\npeasant costume, a cap alike hideous and costly, with long flaps of native\r\nlace, a petticoat and jacket of cloth, and sabots more like little boats than\r\nshoes, it seemed all right, and soothingly in character.\r\n\n\r\nThe expression of her face was not quite so soothing as the cut of her costume;\r\nanything more cantankerous I have seldom seen; she would scarcely reply to my\r\ninquiry after Madame Walravens; I believe she would have snatched the basket of\r\nfruit from my hand, had not the old priest, hobbling up, checked her, and\r\nhimself lent an ear to the message with which I was charged.\r\n\n\r\nHis apparent deafness rendered it a little difficult to make him fully\r\nunderstand that I must see Madame Walravens, and consign the fruit into her own\r\nhands. At last, however, he comprehended the fact that such were my orders, and\r\nthat duty enjoined their literal fulfilment. Addressing the aged bonne, not in\r\nFrench, but in the aboriginal tongue of Labassecour, he persuaded her, at last,\r\nto let me cross the inhospitable threshold, and himself escorting me up-stairs,\r\nI was ushered into a sort of salon, and there left.\r\n\n\r\nThe room was large, and had a fine old ceiling, and almost church-like windows\r\nof coloured-glass; but it was desolate, and in the shadow of a coming storm,\r\nlooked strangely lowering. Within\u2014opened a smaller room; there, however, the\r\nblind of the single casement was closed; through the deep gloom few details of\r\nfurniture were apparent. These few I amused myself by puzzling to make out;\r\nand, in particular, I was attracted by the outline of a picture on the wall.\r\n\n\r\nBy-and-by the picture seemed to give way: to my bewilderment, it shook, it\r\nsunk, it rolled back into nothing; its vanishing left an opening arched,\r\nleading into an arched passage, with a mystic winding stair; both passage and\r\nstair were of cold stone, uncarpeted and unpainted. Down this donjon stair\r\ndescended a tap, tap, like a stick; soon there fell on the steps a shadow, and\r\nlast of all, I was aware of a substance.\r\n\n\r\nYet, was it actual substance, this appearance approaching me? this obstruction,\r\npartially darkening the arch?\r\n\n\r\nIt drew near, and I saw it well. I began to comprehend where I was. Well might\r\nthis old square be named quarter of the Magi\u2014well might the three towers,\r\noverlooking it, own for godfathers three mystic sages of a dead and dark art.\r\nHoar enchantment here prevailed; a spell had opened for me elf-land\u2014that\r\ncell-like room, that vanishing picture, that arch and passage, and stair of\r\nstone, were all parts of a fairy tale. Distincter even than these scenic\r\ndetails stood the chief figure\u2014Cunegonde, the sorceress! Malevola, the evil\r\nfairy. How was she?\r\n\n\r\nShe might be three feet high, but she had no shape; her skinny hands rested\r\nupon each other, and pressed the gold knob of a wand-like ivory staff. Her face\r\nwas large, set, not upon her shoulders, but before her breast; she seemed to\r\nhave no neck; I should have said there were a hundred years in her features,\r\nand more perhaps in her eyes\u2014her malign, unfriendly eyes, with thick grey brows\r\nabove, and livid lids all round. How severely they viewed me, with a sort of\r\ndull displeasure!\r\n\n\r\nThis being wore a gown of brocade, dyed bright blue, full-tinted as the\r\ngentianella flower, and covered with satin foliage in a large pattern; over the\r\ngown a costly shawl, gorgeously bordered, and so large for her, that its\r\nmany-coloured fringe swept the floor. But her chief points were her jewels: she\r\nhad long, clear earrings, blazing with a lustre which could not be borrowed or\r\nfalse; she had rings on her skeleton hands, with thick gold hoops, and\r\nstones\u2014purple, green, and blood-red. Hunchbacked, dwarfish, and doting, she was\r\nadorned like a barbarian queen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue me voulez-vous?\u201d said she, hoarsely, with the voice rather of male than of\r\nfemale old age; and, indeed, a silver beard bristled her chin.\r\n\n\r\nI delivered my basket and my message.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is all,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTruly, it was well worth while,\u201d she answered. \u201cReturn to Madame Beck, and\r\ntell her I can buy fruit when I want it, et quant \u00e0 ses f\u00e9licitations, je m\u2019en\r\nmoque!\u201d And this courteous dame turned her back.\r\n\n\r\nJust as she turned, a peal of thunder broke, and a flash of lightning blazed\r\nbroad over salon and boudoir. The tale of magic seemed to proceed with due\r\naccompaniment of the elements. The wanderer, decoyed into the enchanted castle,\r\nheard rising, outside, the spell-wakened tempest.\r\n\n\r\nWhat, in all this, was I to think of Madame Beck? She owned strange\r\nacquaintance; she offered messages and gifts at an unique shrine, and\r\ninauspicious seemed the bearing of the uncouth thing she worshipped. There went\r\nthat sullen Sidonia, tottering and trembling like palsy incarnate, tapping her\r\nivory staff on the mosaic parquet, and muttering venomously as she vanished.\r\n\n\r\nDown washed the rain, deep lowered the welkin; the clouds, ruddy a while ago,\r\nhad now, through all their blackness, turned deadly pale, as if in terror.\r\nNotwithstanding my late boast about not fearing a shower, I hardly liked to go\r\nout under this waterspout. Then the gleams of lightning were very fierce, the\r\nthunder crashed very near; this storm had gathered immediately above Villette;\r\nit seemed to have burst at the zenith; it rushed down prone; the forked, slant\r\nbolts pierced athwart vertical torrents; red zigzags interlaced a descent\r\nblanched as white metal: and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen\r\nabundance.\r\n\n\r\nLeaving Madame Walravens\u2019 inhospitable salon, I betook myself to her cold\r\nstaircase; there was a seat on the landing\u2014there I waited. Somebody came\r\ngliding along the gallery just above; it was the old priest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed Mademoiselle shall not sit there,\u201d said he. \u201cIt would displeasure our\r\nbenefactor if he knew a stranger was so treated in this house.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he begged me so earnestly to return to the salon, that, without\r\ndiscourtesy, I could not but comply. The smaller room was better furnished and\r\nmore habitable than the larger; thither he introduced me. Partially withdrawing\r\nthe blind, he disclosed what seemed more like an oratory than a boudoir, a very\r\nsolemn little chamber, looking as if it were a place rather dedicated to relics\r\nand remembrance, than designed for present use and comfort.\r\n\n\r\nThe good father sat down, as if to keep me company; but instead of conversing,\r\nhe took out a book, fastened on the page his eyes, and employed his lips in\r\nwhispering\u2014what sounded like a prayer or litany. A yellow electric light from\r\nthe sky gilded his bald head; his figure remained in shade\u2014deep and purple; he\r\nsat still as sculpture; he seemed to forget me for his prayers; he only looked\r\nup when a fiercer bolt, or a harsher, closer rattle told of nearing danger;\r\neven then, it was not in fear, but in seeming awe, he raised his eyes. I too\r\nwas awe-struck; being, however, under no pressure of slavish terror, my\r\nthoughts and observations were free.\r\n\n\r\nTo speak truth, I was beginning to fancy that the old priest resembled that\r\nP\u00e8re Silas, before whom I had kneeled in the church of the B\u00e9guinage. The idea\r\nwas vague, for I had seen my confessor only in dusk and in profile, yet still I\r\nseemed to trace a likeness: I thought also I recognized the voice. While I\r\nwatched him, he betrayed, by one lifted look, that he felt my scrutiny; I\r\nturned to note the room; that too had its half mystic interest.\r\n\n\r\nBeside a cross of curiously carved old ivory, yellow with time, and sloped\r\nabove a dark-red prie-dieu, furnished duly, with rich missal and ebon\r\nrosary\u2014hung the picture whose dim outline had drawn my eyes before\u2014the picture\r\nwhich moved, fell away with the wall and let in phantoms. Imperfectly seen, I\r\nhad taken it for a Madonna; revealed by clearer light, it proved to be a\r\nwoman\u2019s portrait in a nun\u2019s dress. The face, though not beautiful, was\r\npleasing; pale, young, and shaded with the dejection of grief or ill health. I\r\nsay again it was not beautiful; it was not even intellectual; its very\r\namiability was the amiability of a weak frame, inactive passions, acquiescent\r\nhabits: yet I looked long at that picture, and could not choose but look.\r\n\n\r\nThe old priest, who at first had seemed to me so deaf and infirm, must yet have\r\nretained his faculties in tolerable preservation; absorbed in his book as he\r\nappeared, without once lifting his head, or, as far as I knew, turning his\r\neyes, he perceived the point towards which my attention was drawn, and, in a\r\nslow distinct voice, dropped, concerning it, these four observations:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was much beloved.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe gave herself to God.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe died young.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is still remembered, still wept.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy that aged lady, Madame Walravens?\u201d I inquired, fancying that I had\r\ndiscovered in the incurable grief of bereavement, a key to that same aged\r\nlady\u2019s desperate ill-humour.\r\n\n\r\nThe father shook his head with half a smile.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said he; \u201ca grand-dame\u2019s affection for her children\u2019s children may be\r\ngreat, and her sorrow for their loss, lively; but it is only the affianced\r\nlover, to whom Fate, Faith, and Death have trebly denied the bliss of union,\r\nwho mourns what he has lost, as Justine Marie is still mourned.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI thought the father rather wished to be questioned, and therefore I inquired\r\nwho had lost and who still mourned \u201cJustine Marie.\u201d I got, in reply, quite a\r\nlittle romantic narrative, told not unimpressively, with the accompaniment of\r\nthe now subsiding storm. I am bound to say it might have been made much more\r\ntruly impressive, if there had been less French, Rousseau-like sentimentalizing\r\nand wire-drawing; and rather more healthful carelessness of effect. But the\r\nworthy father was obviously a Frenchman born and bred (I became more and more\r\npersuaded of his resemblance to my confessor)\u2014he was a true son of Rome; when\r\nhe did lift his eyes, he looked at me out of their corners, with more and\r\nsharper subtlety than, one would have thought, could survive the wear and tear\r\nof seventy years. Yet, I believe, he was a good old man.\r\n\n\r\nThe hero of his tale was some former pupil of his, whom he now called his\r\nbenefactor, and who, it appears, had loved this pale Justine Marie, the\r\ndaughter of rich parents, at a time when his own worldly prospects were such as\r\nto justify his aspiring to a well-dowered hand. The pupil\u2019s father\u2014once a rich\r\nbanker\u2014had failed, died, and left behind him only debts and destitution. The\r\nson was then forbidden to think of Marie; especially that old witch of a\r\ngrand-dame I had seen, Madame Walravens, opposed the match with all the\r\nviolence of a temper which deformity made sometimes demoniac. The mild Marie\r\nhad neither the treachery to be false, nor the force to be quite staunch to her\r\nlover; she gave up her first suitor, but, refusing to accept a second with a\r\nheavier purse, withdrew to a convent, and there died in her noviciate.\r\n\n\r\nLasting anguish, it seems, had taken possession of the faithful heart which\r\nworshipped her, and the truth of that love and grief had been shown in a manner\r\nwhich touched even me, as I listened.\r\n\n\r\nSome years after Justine Marie\u2019s death, ruin had come on her house too: her\r\nfather, by nominal calling a jeweller, but who also dealt a good deal on the\r\nBourse, had been concerned in some financial transactions which entailed\r\nexposure and ruinous fines. He died of grief for the loss, and shame for the\r\ninfamy. His old hunchbacked mother and his bereaved wife were left penniless,\r\nand might have died too of want; but their lost daughter\u2019s once-despised, yet\r\nmost true-hearted suitor, hearing of the condition of these ladies, came with\r\nsingular devotedness to the rescue. He took on their insolent pride the revenge\r\nof the purest charity\u2014housing, caring for, befriending them, so as no son could\r\nhave done it more tenderly and efficiently. The mother\u2014on the whole a good\r\nwoman\u2014died blessing him; the strange, godless, loveless, misanthrope\r\ngrandmother lived still, entirely supported by this self-sacrificing man. Her,\r\nwho had been the bane of his life, blighting his hope, and awarding him, for\r\nlove and domestic happiness, long mourning and cheerless solitude, he treated\r\nwith the respect a good son might offer a kind mother. He had brought her to\r\nthis house, \u201cand,\u201d continued the priest, while genuine tears rose to his eyes,\r\n\u201chere, too, he shelters me, his old tutor, and Agnes, a superannuated servant\r\nof his father\u2019s family. To our sustenance, and to other charities, I know he\r\ndevotes three-parts of his income, keeping only the fourth to provide himself\r\nwith bread and the most modest accommodations. By this arrangement he has\r\nrendered it impossible to himself ever to marry: he has given himself to God\r\nand to his angel-bride as much as if he were a priest, like me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe father had wiped away his tears before he uttered these last words, and in\r\npronouncing them, he for one instant raised his eyes to mine. I caught this\r\nglance, despite its veiled character; the momentary gleam shot a meaning which\r\nstruck me.\r\n\n\r\nThese Romanists are strange beings. Such a one among them\u2014whom you know no more\r\nthan the last Inca of Peru, or the first Emperor of China\u2014knows you and all\r\nyour concerns; and has his reasons for saying to you so and so, when you simply\r\nthought the communication sprang impromptu from the instant\u2019s impulse: his plan\r\nin bringing it about that you shall come on such a day, to such a place, under\r\nsuch and such circumstances, when the whole arrangement seems to your crude\r\napprehension the ordinance of chance, or the sequel of exigency. Madame Beck\u2019s\r\nsuddenly-recollected message and present, my artless embassy to the Place of\r\nthe Magi, the old priest accidentally descending the steps and crossing the\r\nsquare, his interposition on my behalf with the bonne who would have sent me\r\naway, his reappearance on the staircase, my introduction to this room, the\r\nportrait, the narrative so affably volunteered\u2014all these little incidents,\r\ntaken as they fell out, seemed each independent of its successor; a handful of\r\nloose beads: but threaded through by that quick-shot and crafty glance of a\r\nJesuit-eye, they dropped pendent in a long string, like that rosary on the\r\nprie-dieu. Where lay the link of junction, where the little clasp of this\r\nmonastic necklace? I saw or felt union, but could not yet find the spot, or\r\ndetect the means of connection.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps the musing-fit into which I had by this time fallen, appeared somewhat\r\nsuspicious in its abstraction; he gently interrupted: \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cI trust you have not far to go through these inundated streets?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMore than half a league.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou live\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the Rue Fossette.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot\u201d (with animation), \u201cnot at the pensionnat of Madame Beck?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDonc\u201d (clapping his hands), \u201cdonc, vous devez conna\u00eetre mon noble \u00e9l\u00e8ve, mon\r\nPaul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Paul Emanuel, Professor of Literature?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe and none other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA brief silence fell. The spring of junction seemed suddenly to have become\r\npalpable; I felt it yield to pressure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWas it of M. Paul you have been speaking?\u201d I presently inquired. \u201cWas he your\r\npupil and the benefactor of Madame Walravens?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, and of Agnes, the old servant: and moreover, (with a certain emphasis),\r\nhe was and is the lover, true, constant and eternal, of that saint in\r\nheaven\u2014Justine Marie.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who, father, are you?\u201d I continued; and though I accentuated the\r\nquestion, its utterance was well nigh superfluous; I was ere this quite\r\nprepared for the answer which actually came.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI, daughter, am P\u00e8re Silas; that unworthy son of Holy Church whom you once\r\nhonoured with a noble and touching confidence, showing me the core of a heart,\r\nand the inner shrine of a mind whereof, in solemn truth, I coveted the\r\ndirection, in behalf of the only true faith. Nor have I for a day lost sight of\r\nyou, nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted interest. Passed under the\r\ndiscipline of Rome, moulded by her high training, inoculated with her salutary\r\ndoctrines, inspired by the zeal she alone gives\u2014I realize what then might be\r\nyour spiritual rank, your practical value; and I envy Heresy her prey.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis struck me as a special state of things\u2014I half-realized myself in that\r\ncondition also; passed under discipline, moulded, trained, inoculated, and so\r\non. \u201cNot so,\u201d thought I, but I restrained deprecation, and sat quietly enough.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose M. Paul does not live here?\u201d I resumed, pursuing a theme which I\r\nthought more to the purpose than any wild renegade dreams.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; he only comes occasionally to worship his beloved saint, to make his\r\nconfession to me, and to pay his respects to her he calls his mother. His own\r\nlodging consists but of two rooms: he has no servant, and yet he will not\r\nsuffer Madame Walravens to dispose of those splendid jewels with which you see\r\nher adorned, and in which she takes a puerile pride as the ornaments of her\r\nyouth, and the last relics of her son the jeweller\u2019s wealth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow often,\u201d murmured I to myself, \u201chas this man, this M. Emanuel, seemed to me\r\nto lack magnanimity in trifles, yet how great he is in great things!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI own I did not reckon amongst the proofs of his greatness, either the act of\r\nconfession, or the saint-worship.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long is it since that lady died?\u201d I inquired, looking at Justine Marie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwenty years. She was somewhat older than M. Emanuel; he was then very young,\r\nfor he is not much beyond forty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes he yet weep her?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis heart will weep her always: the essence of Emanuel\u2019s nature is\u2014constancy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was said with marked emphasis.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now the sun broke out pallid and waterish; the rain yet fell, but there was\r\nno more tempest: that hot firmament had cloven and poured out its lightnings. A\r\nlonger delay would scarce leave daylight for my return, so I rose, thanked the\r\nfather for his hospitality and his tale, was benignantly answered by a \u201cpax\r\nvobiscum,\u201d which I made kindly welcome, because it seemed uttered with a true\r\nbenevolence; but I liked less the mystic phrase accompanying it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDaughter, you shall be what you shall be!\u201d an oracle that made\r\nme shrug my shoulders as soon as I had got outside the door. Few of us know\r\nwhat we are to come to certainly, but for all that had happened yet, I had good\r\nhopes of living and dying a sober-minded Protestant: there was a hollowness\r\nwithin, and a flourish around \u201cHoly Church\u201d which tempted me but moderately. I\r\nwent on my way pondering many things. Whatever Romanism may be, there are good\r\nRomanists: this man, Emanuel, seemed of the best; touched with superstition,\r\ninfluenced by priestcraft, yet wondrous for fond faith, for pious devotion, for\r\nsacrifice of self, for charity unbounded. It remained to see how Rome, by her\r\nagents, handled such qualities; whether she cherished them for their own sake\r\nand for God\u2019s, or put them out to usury and made booty of the interest.\r\n\n\r\nBy the time I reached home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly saved me a portion\r\nof dinner, which indeed I needed. She called me into the little cabinet to\r\npartake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance, bringing me a\r\nglass of wine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d began she, chuckling, \u201cand what sort of a reception did Madame\r\nWalravens give you? Elle est dr\u00f4le, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI told her what had passed, delivering verbatim the courteous message with\r\nwhich I had been charged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh la singuli\u00e8re petite bossue!\u201d laughed she. \u201cEt figurez-vous qu\u2019elle me\r\nd\u00e9teste, parcequ\u2019elle me croit amoureuse de mon cousin Paul; ce petit d\u00e9vot qui\r\nn\u2019ose pas bouger, \u00e0 moins que son confesseur ne lui donne la permission! Au\r\nreste\u201d (she went on), \u201cif he wanted to marry ever so much\u2014soit moi, soit une\r\nautre\u2014he could not do it; he has too large a family already on his hands: M\u00e8re\r\nWalravens, P\u00e8re Silas, Dame Agnes, and a whole troop of nameless paupers. There\r\nnever was a man like him for laying on himself burdens greater than he can\r\nbear, voluntarily incurring needless responsibilities. Besides, he harbours a\r\nromantic idea about some pale-faced Marie Justine\u2014personnage assez niaise \u00e0 ce\r\nque je pense\u201d (such was Madame\u2019s irreverent remark), \u201cwho has been an angel in\r\nheaven, or elsewhere, this score of years, and to whom he means to go, free\r\nfrom all earthly ties, pure comme un lis, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il dit. Oh, you would laugh\r\ncould you but know half M. Emanuel\u2019s crotchets and eccentricities! But I hinder\r\nyou from taking refreshment, ma bonne Meess, which you must need; eat your\r\nsupper, drink your wine, oubliez les anges, les bossues, et surtout, les\r\nProfesseurs\u2014et bon soir!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"36": "\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nFRATERNITY.\n\r\n\u201cOubliez les Professeurs.\u201d So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise woman,\r\nbut she should not have uttered those words. To do so was a mistake. That night\r\nshe should have left me calm\u2014not excited, indifferent, not interested, isolated\r\nin my own estimation and that of others\u2014not connected, even in idea, with this\r\nsecond person whom I was to forget.\r\n\n\r\nForget him? Ah! they took a sage plan to make me forget him\u2014the wiseheads! They\r\nshowed me how good he was; they made of my dear little man a stainless little\r\nhero. And then they had prated about his manner of loving. What means had I,\r\nbefore this day, of being certain whether he could love at all or not?\r\n\n\r\nI had known him jealous, suspicious; I had seen about him certain tendernesses,\r\nfitfulnesses\u2014a softness which came like a warm air, and a ruth which passed\r\nlike early dew, dried in the heat of his irritabilities: this was all I\r\nhad seen. And they, P\u00e8re Silas and Modeste Maria Beck (that these two wrought\r\nin concert I could not doubt) opened up the adytum of his heart\u2014showed me one\r\ngrand love, the child of this southern nature\u2019s youth, born so strong and\r\nperfect, that it had laughed at Death himself, despised his mean rape of\r\nmatter, clung to immortal spirit, and in victory and faith, had watched beside\r\na tomb twenty years.\r\n\n\r\nThis had been done\u2014not idly: this was not a mere hollow indulgence of\r\nsentiment; he had proven his fidelity by the consecration of his best energies\r\nto an unselfish purpose, and attested it by limitless personal sacrifices: for\r\nthose once dear to her he prized\u2014he had laid down vengeance, and taken up a\r\ncross.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as for Justine Marie, I knew what she was as well as if I had seen her. I\r\nknew she was well enough; there were girls like her in Madame Beck\u2019s\r\nschool\u2014phlegmatics\u2014pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil,\r\nundistinguished for good.\r\n\n\r\nIf she wore angels\u2019 wings, I knew whose poet-fancy conferred them. If her\r\nforehead shone luminous with the reflex of a halo, I knew in the fire of whose\r\nirids that circlet of holy flame had generation.\r\n\n\r\nWas I, then, to be frightened by Justine Marie? Was the picture of a pale dead\r\nnun to rise, an eternal barrier? And what of the charities which absorbed his\r\nworldly goods? What of his heart sworn to virginity?\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck\u2014P\u00e8re Silas\u2014you should not have suggested these questions. They were\r\nat once the deepest puzzle, the strongest obstruction, and the keenest\r\nstimulus, I had ever felt. For a week of nights and days I fell asleep\u2014I\r\ndreamt, and I woke upon these two questions. In the whole world there was no\r\nanswer to them, except where one dark little man stood, sat, walked, lectured,\r\nunder the head-piece of a bandit bonnet-grec, and within the girth of a sorry\r\npalet\u00f4t, much be-inked, and no little adust.\r\n\n\r\nAfter that visit to the Rue des Mages, I did want to see him again. I\r\nfelt as if\u2014knowing what I now knew\u2014his countenance would offer a page more\r\nlucid, more interesting than ever; I felt a longing to trace in it the imprint\r\nof that primitive devotedness, the signs of that half-knightly, half-saintly\r\nchivalry which the priest\u2019s narrative imputed to his nature. He had become my\r\nChristian hero: under that character I wanted to view him.\r\n\n\r\nNor was opportunity slow to favour; my new impressions underwent her test the\r\nnext day. Yes: I was granted an interview with my \u201cChristian hero\u201d\u2014an interview\r\nnot very heroic, or sentimental, or biblical, but lively enough in its way.\r\n\n\r\nAbout three o\u2019clock of the afternoon, the peace of the first classe\u2014safely\r\nestablished, as it seemed, under the serene sway of Madame Beck, who, in\r\npropria persona, was giving one of her orderly and useful lessons\u2014this\r\npeace, I say, suffered a sudden fracture by the wild inburst of a palet\u00f4t.\r\n\n\r\nNobody at the moment was quieter than myself. Eased of responsibility by Madame\r\nBeck\u2019s presence, soothed by her uniform tones, pleased and edified with her\r\nclear exposition of the subject in hand (for she taught well), I sat bent over\r\nmy desk, drawing\u2014that is, copying an elaborate line engraving, tediously\r\nworking up my copy to the finish of the original, for that was my practical\r\nnotion of art; and, strange to say, I took extreme pleasure in the labour, and\r\ncould even produce curiously finical Chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint\r\nplates\u2014things about as valuable as so many achievements in worsted-work, but I\r\nthought pretty well of them in those days.\r\n\n\r\nWhat was the matter? My drawing, my pencils, my precious copy, gathered into\r\none crushed-up handful, perished from before my sight; I myself appeared to be\r\nshaken or emptied out of my chair, as a solitary and withered nutmeg might be\r\nemptied out of a spice-box by an excited cook. That chair and my desk, seized\r\nby the wild palet\u00f4t, one under each sleeve, were borne afar; in a second, I\r\nfollowed the furniture; in two minutes they and I were fixed in the centre of\r\nthe grand salle\u2014a vast adjoining room, seldom used save for dancing and choral\r\nsinging-lessons\u2014fixed with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the remotest\r\nhope of our ever being permitted to stir thence again.\r\n\n\r\nHaving partially collected my scared wits, I found myself in the presence of\r\ntwo men, gentlemen, I suppose I should say\u2014one dark, the other light\u2014one having\r\na stiff, half-military air, and wearing a braided surtout; the other partaking,\r\nin garb and bearing, more of the careless aspect of the student or artist\r\nclass: both flourishing in full magnificence of moustaches, whiskers, and\r\nimperial. M. Emanuel stood a little apart from these; his countenance and eyes\r\nexpressed strong choler; he held forth his hand with his tribune gesture.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said he, \u201cyour business is to prove to these gentlemen that I\r\nam no liar. You will answer, to the best of your ability, such questions as\r\nthey shall put. You will also write on such theme as they shall select. In\r\ntheir eyes, it appears, I hold the position of an unprincipled impostor. I\r\nwrite essays; and, with deliberate forgery, sign to them my pupils\u2019 names, and\r\nboast of them as their work. You will disprove this charge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nGrand ciel! Here was the show-trial, so long evaded, come on me like a\r\nthunder-clap. These two fine, braided, mustachioed, sneering personages, were\r\nnone other than dandy professors of the college\u2014Messieurs Boissec and\r\nRochemorte\u2014a pair of cold-blooded fops and pedants, sceptics, and scoffers. It\r\nseems that M. Paul had been rashly exhibiting something I had\r\nwritten\u2014something, he had never once praised, or even mentioned, in my hearing,\r\nand which I deemed forgotten. The essay was not remarkable at all; it only\r\nseemed remarkable, compared with the average productions of foreign\r\nschool-girls; in an English establishment it would have passed scarce noticed.\r\nMessieurs Boissec and Rochemorte had thought proper to question its\r\ngenuineness, and insinuate a cheat; I was now to bear my testimony to the\r\ntruth, and to be put to the torture of their examination.\r\n\n\r\nA memorable scene ensued.\r\n\n\r\nThey began with classics. A dead blank. They went on to French history. I\r\nhardly knew M\u00e9rov\u00e9e from Pharamond. They tried me in various \u2019ologies, and\r\nstill only got a shake of the head, and an unchanging \u201cJe n\u2019en sais rien.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAfter an expressive pause, they proceeded to matters of general information,\r\nbroaching one or two subjects which I knew pretty well, and on which I had\r\noften reflected. M. Emanuel, who had hitherto stood looking on, dark as the\r\nwinter-solstice, brightened up somewhat; he thought I should now show myself at\r\nleast no fool.\r\n\n\r\nHe learned his error. Though answers to the questions surged up fast, my mind\r\nfilling like a rising well, ideas were there, but not words. I either\r\ncould not, or would not speak\u2014I am not sure which: partly, I\r\nthink, my nerves had got wrong, and partly my humour was crossed.\r\n\n\r\nI heard one of my examiners\u2014he of the braided surtout\u2014whisper to his\r\nco-professor, \u201cEst-elle donc idiote?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I thought, \u201can idiot she is, and always will be, for such as you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I suffered\u2014suffered cruelly; I saw the damps gather on M. Paul\u2019s brow, and\r\nhis eye spoke a passionate yet sad reproach. He would not believe in my total\r\nlack of popular cleverness; he thought I could be prompt if I\r\nwould.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, to relieve him, the professors, and myself, I stammered out:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen, you had better let me go; you will get no good of me; as you say, I\r\nam an idiot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI wish I could have spoken with calm and dignity, or I wish my sense had\r\nsufficed to make me hold my tongue; that traitor tongue tripped, faltered.\r\nBeholding the judges cast on M. Emanuel a hard look of triumph, and hearing the\r\ndistressed tremor of my own voice, out I burst in a fit of choking tears. The\r\nemotion was far more of anger than grief; had I been a man and strong, I could\r\nhave challenged that pair on the spot\u2014but it was emotion, and I would\r\nrather have been scourged than betrayed it.\r\n\n\r\nThe incapables! Could they not see at once the crude hand of a novice in that\r\ncomposition they called a forgery? The subject was classical. When M. Paul\r\ndictated the trait on which the essay was to turn, I heard it for the first\r\ntime; the matter was new to me, and I had no material for its treatment. But I\r\ngot books, read up the facts, laboriously constructed a skeleton out of the dry\r\nbones of the real, and then clothed them, and tried to breathe into them life,\r\nand in this last aim I had pleasure. With me it was a difficult and anxious\r\ntime till my facts were found, selected, and properly jointed; nor could I rest\r\nfrom research and effort till I was satisfied of correct anatomy; the strength\r\nof my inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity sometimes enabled me to\r\nshun egregious blunders; but the knowledge was not there in my head, ready and\r\nmellow; it had not been sown in Spring, grown in Summer, harvested in Autumn,\r\nand garnered through Winter; whatever I wanted I must go out and gather fresh;\r\nglean of wild herbs my lapful, and shred them green into the pot. Messieurs\r\nBoissec and Rochemorte did not perceive this. They mistook my work for the work\r\nof a ripe scholar.\r\n\n\r\nThey would not yet let me go: I must sit down and write before them. As I\r\ndipped my pen in the ink with a shaking hand, and surveyed the white paper with\r\neyes half-blinded and overflowing, one of my judges began mincingly to\r\napologize for the pain he caused.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNous agissons dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Nous ne voulons pas vous blesser,\u201d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\n\r\nScorn gave me nerve. I only answered,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDictate, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nRochemorte named this theme: \u201cHuman Justice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHuman Justice! What was I to make of it? Blank, cold abstraction, unsuggestive\r\nto me of one inspiring idea; and there stood M. Emanuel, sad as Saul, and stern\r\nas Joab, and there triumphed his accusers.\r\n\n\r\nAt these two I looked. I was gathering my courage to tell them that I would\r\nneither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction, that their theme\r\ndid not suit, nor their presence inspire me, and that, notwithstanding, whoever\r\nthrew the shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel\u2019s honour, outraged that truth of\r\nwhich they had announced themselves the\u2014champions: I meant to utter all\r\nthis, I say, when suddenly, a light darted on memory.\r\n\n\r\nThose two faces looking out of the forest of long hair, moustache, and\r\nwhisker\u2014those two cold yet bold, trustless yet presumptuous visages\u2014were the\r\nsame faces, the very same that, projected in full gaslight from behind the\r\npillars of a portico, had half frightened me to death on the night of my\r\ndesolate arrival in Villette. These, I felt morally certain, were the very\r\nheroes who had driven a friendless foreigner beyond her reckoning and her\r\nstrength, chased her breathless over a whole quarter of the town.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPious mentors!\u201d thought I. \u201cPure guides for youth! If \u2018Human Justice\u2019 were\r\nwhat she ought to be, you two would scarce hold your present post, or enjoy\r\nyour present credit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAn idea once seized, I fell to work. \u201cHuman Justice\u201d rushed before me in novel\r\nguise, a red, random beldame, with arms akimbo. I saw her in her house, the den\r\nof confusion: servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give;\r\nbeggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed; a swarm of children,\r\nsick and quarrelsome, crawled round her feet, and yelled in her ears appeals\r\nfor notice, sympathy, cure, redress. The honest woman cared for none of these\r\nthings. She had a warm seat of her own by the fire, she had her own solace in a\r\nshort black pipe, and a bottle of Mrs. Sweeny\u2019s soothing syrup; she smoked and\r\nshe sipped, and she enjoyed her paradise; and whenever a cry of the suffering\r\nsouls about her pierced her ears too keenly\u2014my jolly dame seized the poker or\r\nthe hearth-brush: if the offender was weak, wronged, and sickly, she\r\neffectually settled him: if he was strong, lively, and violent, she only\r\nmenaced, then plunged her hand in her deep pouch, and flung a liberal shower of\r\nsugar-plums.\r\n\n\r\nSuch was the sketch of \u201cHuman Justice,\u201d scratched hurriedly on paper, and\r\nplaced at the service of Messrs. Boissec and Rochemorte. M. Emanuel read it\r\nover my shoulder. Waiting no comment, I curtsied to the trio, and withdrew.\r\n\n\r\nAfter school that day, M. Paul and I again met. Of course the meeting did not\r\nat first run smooth; there was a crow to pluck with him; that forced\r\nexamination could not be immediately digested. A crabbed dialogue terminated in\r\nmy being called \u201cune petite moqueuse et sans-c\u0153ur,\u201d and in Monsieur\u2019s\r\ntemporary departure.\r\n\n\r\nNot wishing him to go quite away, only desiring he should feel that such a\r\ntransport as he had that day given way to, could not be indulged with perfect\r\nimpunity, I was not sorry to see him, soon after, gardening in the berceau. He\r\napproached the glass door; I drew near also. We spoke of some flowers growing\r\nround it. By-and-by Monsieur laid down his spade; by-and-by he recommenced\r\nconversation, passed to other subjects, and at last touched a point of\r\ninterest.\r\n\n\r\nConscious that his proceeding of that day was specially open to a charge of\r\nextravagance, M. Paul half apologized; he half regretted, too, the fitfulness\r\nof his moods at all times, yet he hinted that some allowance ought to be made\r\nfor him. \u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cI can hardly expect it at your hands, Miss Lucy; you\r\nknow neither me, nor my position, nor my history.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis history. I took up the word at once; I pursued the idea.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur,\u201d I rejoined. \u201cOf course, as you say, I know neither your\r\nhistory, nor your position, nor your sacrifices, nor any of your sorrows, or\r\ntrials, or affections, or fidelities. Oh, no! I know nothing about you; you are\r\nfor me altogether a stranger.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHein?\u201d he murmured, arching his brows in surprise.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know, Monsieur, I only see you in classe\u2014stern, dogmatic, hasty,\r\nimperious. I only hear of you in town as active and wilful, quick to originate,\r\nhasty to lead, but slow to persuade, and hard to bend. A man like you, without\r\nties, can have no attachments; without dependants, no duties. All we, with whom\r\nyou come in contact, are machines, which you thrust here and there,\r\ninconsiderate of their feelings. You seek your recreations in public, by the\r\nlight of the evening chandelier: this school and yonder college are your\r\nworkshops, where you fabricate the ware called pupils. I don\u2019t so much as know\r\nwhere you live; it is natural to take it for granted that you have no home, and\r\nneed none.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am judged,\u201d said he. \u201cYour opinion of me is just what I thought it was. For\r\nyou I am neither a man nor a Christian. You see me void of affection and\r\nreligion, unattached by friend or family, unpiloted by principle or faith. It\r\nis well, Mademoiselle; such is our reward in this life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are a philosopher, Monsieur; a cynic philosopher\u201d (and I looked at his\r\npalet\u00f4t, of which he straightway brushed the dim sleeve with his hand),\r\n\u201cdespising the foibles of humanity\u2014above its luxuries\u2014independent of its\r\ncomforts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt vous, Mademoiselle? vous \u00eates proprette et douillette, et affreusement\r\ninsensible, par-dessus le march\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, in short, Monsieur, now I think of it, you must live somewhere? Do\r\ntell me where; and what establishment of servants do you keep?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith a fearful projection of the under-lip, implying an impetus of scorn the\r\nmost decided, he broke out\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe vis dans un trou! I inhabit a den, Miss\u2014a cavern, where you would not put\r\nyour dainty nose. Once, with base shame of speaking the whole truth, I talked\r\nabout my \u2018study\u2019 in that college: know now that this \u2018study\u2019 is my whole abode;\r\nmy chamber is there and my drawing-room. As for my \u2018establishment of servants\u2019\u201d\r\n(mimicking my voice) \u201cthey number ten; les voil\u00e0.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd he grimly spread, close under my eyes, his ten fingers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI black my boots,\u201d pursued he savagely. \u201cI brush my palet\u00f4t.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur, it is too plain; you never do that,\u201d was my parenthesis.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJe fais mon lit et mon m\u00e9nage; I seek my dinner in a restaurant; my supper\r\ntakes care, of itself; I pass days laborious and loveless; nights long and\r\nlonely; I am ferocious, and bearded and monkish; and nothing now living in this\r\nworld loves me, except some old hearts worn like my own, and some few beings,\r\nimpoverished, suffering, poor in purse and in spirit, whom the kingdoms of this\r\nworld own not, but to whom a will and testament not to be disputed has\r\nbequeathed the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, Monsieur; but I know!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know? many things, I verily believe; yet not me, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know that you have a pleasant old house in a pleasant old square of the\r\nBasse-Ville\u2014why don\u2019t you go and live there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHein?\u201d muttered he again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI liked it much, Monsieur; with the steps ascending to the door, the grey\r\nflags in front, the nodding trees behind\u2014real trees, not shrubs\u2014trees dark,\r\nhigh, and of old growth. And the boudoir-oratoire\u2014you should make that room\r\nyour study; it is so quiet and solemn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe eyed me closely; he half-smiled, half-coloured. \u201cWhere did you pick up all\r\nthat? Who told you?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNobody told me. Did I dream it, Monsieur, do you think?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan I enter into your visions? Can I guess a woman\u2019s waking thoughts, much\r\nless her sleeping fantasies?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I dreamt it, I saw in my dream human beings as well as a house. I saw a\r\npriest, old, bent, and grey, and a domestic\u2014old, too, and picturesque; and a\r\nlady, splendid but strange; her head would scarce reach to my elbow\u2014her\r\nmagnificence might ransom a duke. She wore a gown bright as lapis-lazuli\u2014a\r\nshawl worth a thousand francs: she was decked with ornaments so brilliant, I\r\nnever saw any with such a beautiful sparkle; but her figure looked as if it had\r\nbeen broken in two and bent double; she seemed also to have outlived the common\r\nyears of humanity, and to have attained those which are only labour and sorrow.\r\nShe was become morose\u2014almost malevolent; yet somebody, it appears, cared\r\nfor her in her infirmities\u2014somebody forgave her trespasses, hoping to have his\r\ntrespasses forgiven. They lived together, these three people\u2014the mistress, the\r\nchaplain, the servant\u2014all old, all feeble, all sheltered under one kind wing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe covered with his hand the upper part of his face, but did not conceal his\r\nmouth, where I saw hovering an expression I liked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see you have entered into my secrets,\u201d said he, \u201cbut how was it done?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo I told him how\u2014the commission on which I had been sent, the storm which had\r\ndetained me, the abruptness of the lady, the kindness of the priest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs I sat waiting for the rain to cease, P\u00e8re Silas whiled away the time with a\r\nstory,\u201d I said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA story! What story? P\u00e8re Silas is no romancist.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell Monsieur the tale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes: begin at the beginning. Let me hear some of Miss Lucy\u2019s French\u2014her best\r\nor her worst\u2014I don\u2019t much care which: let us have a good poign\u00e9e of barbarisms,\r\nand a bounteous dose of the insular accent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur is not going to be gratified by a tale of ambitious proportions, and\r\nthe spectacle of the narrator sticking fast in the midst. But I will tell him\r\nthe title\u2014the \u2018Priest\u2019s Pupil.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said he, the swarthy flush again dyeing his dark cheek. \u201cThe good old\r\nfather could not have chosen a worse subject; it is his weak point. But what of\r\nthe \u2018Priest\u2019s Pupil?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! many things.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may as well define what things. I mean to know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere was the pupil\u2019s youth, the pupil\u2019s manhood;\u2014his avarice, his\r\ningratitude, his implacability, his inconstancy. Such a bad pupil, Monsieur!\u2014so\r\nthankless, cold-hearted, unchivalrous, unforgiving!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt puis?\u201d said he, taking a cigar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEt puis,\u201d I pursued, \u201che underwent calamities which one did not pity\u2014bore them\r\nin a spirit one did not admire\u2014endured wrongs for which one felt no sympathy;\r\nfinally took the unchristian revenge of heaping coals of fire on his\r\nadversary\u2019s head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have not told me all,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNearly all, I think: I have indicated the heads of P\u00e8re Silas\u2019s chapters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have forgotten one\u2014that which touched on the pupil\u2019s lack of affection\u2014on\r\nhis hard, cold, monkish heart.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue; I remember now. P\u00e8re Silas did say that his vocation was almost\r\nthat of a priest\u2014that his life was considered consecrated.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy what bonds or duties?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy the ties of the past and the charities of the present.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have, then, the whole situation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have now told Monsieur all that was told me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSome meditative minutes passed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mademoiselle Lucy, look at me, and with that truth which I believe you\r\nnever knowingly violate, answer me one question. Raise your eyes; rest them on\r\nmine; have no hesitation; fear not to trust me\u2014I am a man to be trusted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI raised my eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKnowing me thoroughly now\u2014all my antecedents, all my responsibilities\u2014having\r\nlong known my faults, can you and I still be friends?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf Monsieur wants a friend in me, I shall be glad to have a friend in him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut a close friend I mean\u2014intimate and real\u2014kindred in all but blood. Will\r\nMiss Lucy be the sister of a very poor, fettered, burdened, encumbered man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not answer him in words, yet I suppose I did answer him; he took\r\nmy hand, which found comfort, in the shelter of his. His friendship was\r\nnot a doubtful, wavering benefit\u2014a cold, distant hope\u2014a sentiment so brittle as\r\nnot to bear the weight of a finger: I at once felt (or thought I felt)\r\nits support like that of some rock.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen I talk of friendship, I mean true friendship,\u201d he repeated\r\nemphatically; and I could hardly believe that words so earnest had blessed my\r\near; I hardly could credit the reality of that kind, anxious look he gave. If\r\nhe really wished for my confidence and regard, and really would\r\ngive me his\u2014why, it seemed to me that life could offer nothing more or better.\r\nIn that case, I was become strong and rich: in a moment I was made\r\nsubstantially happy. To ascertain the fact, to fix and seal it, I asked\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Monsieur quite serious? Does he really think he needs me, and can take an\r\ninterest in me as a sister?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSurely, surely,\u201d said he; \u201ca lonely man like me, who has no sister, must be\r\nbut too glad to find in some woman\u2019s heart a sister\u2019s pure affection.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd dare I rely on Monsieur\u2019s regard? Dare I speak to him when I am so\r\ninclined?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little sister must make her own experiments,\u201d said he; \u201cI will give no\r\npromises. She must tease and try her wayward brother till she has drilled him\r\ninto what she wishes. After all, he is no inductile material in some hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile he spoke, the tone of his voice, the light of his now affectionate eye,\r\ngave me such a pleasure as, certainly, I had never felt. I envied no girl her\r\nlover, no bride her bridegroom, no wife her husband; I was content with this my\r\nvoluntary, self-offering friend. If he would but prove reliable, and he\r\nlooked reliable, what, beyond his friendship, could I ever covet? But,\r\nif all melted like a dream, as once before had happened\u2014?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQu\u2019est-ce donc? What is it?\u201d said he, as this thought threw its weight on my\r\nheart, its shadow on my countenance. I told him; and after a moment\u2019s pause,\r\nand a thoughtful smile, he showed me how an equal fear\u2014lest I should weary of\r\nhim, a man of moods so difficult and fitful\u2014had haunted his mind for more than\r\none day, or one month.\r\n\n\r\nOn hearing this, a quiet courage cheered me. I ventured a word of re-assurance.\r\nThat word was not only tolerated; its repetition was courted. I grew quite\r\nhappy\u2014strangely happy\u2014in making him secure, content, tranquil. Yesterday, I\r\ncould not have believed that earth held, or life afforded, moments like the few\r\nI was now passing. Countless times it had been my lot to watch apprehended\r\nsorrow close darkly in; but to see unhoped-for happiness take form, find place,\r\nand grow more real as the seconds sped, was indeed a new experience.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d said M. Paul, speaking low, and still holding my hand, \u201cdid you see a\r\npicture in the boudoir of the old house?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did; a picture painted on a panel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe portrait of a nun?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou heard her history?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou remember what we saw that night in the berceau?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall never forget it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not connect the two ideas; that would be folly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the apparition when I saw the portrait,\u201d said I; which was true\r\nenough.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou did not, nor will you fancy,\u201d pursued he, \u201cthat a saint in heaven perturbs\r\nherself with rivalries of earth? Protestants are rarely superstitious; these\r\nmorbid fancies will not beset you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know not what to think of this matter; but I believe a perfectly natural\r\nsolution of this seeming mystery will one day be arrived at.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless, doubtless. Besides, no good-living woman\u2014much less a pure, happy\r\nspirit\u2014would trouble amity like ours\u2014n\u2019est-il pas vrai?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEre I could answer, Fifine Beck burst in, rosy and abrupt, calling out that I\r\nwas wanted. Her mother was going into town to call on some English family, who\r\nhad applied for a prospectus: my services were needed as interpreter. The\r\ninterruption was not unseasonable: sufficient for the day is always the evil;\r\nfor this hour, its good sufficed. Yet I should have liked to ask M. Paul\r\nwhether the \u201cmorbid fancies,\u201d against which he warned me, wrought in his own\r\nbrain.\r\n\n"}
{"37": "\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nTHE APPLE OF DISCORD.\n\r\nBesides Fifine Beck\u2019s mother, another power had a word to say to M. Paul and\r\nme, before that covenant of friendship could be ratified. We were under the\r\nsurveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son through that\r\nmystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to which M. Emanuel drew nigh\r\nmonth by month\u2014the sliding panel of the confessional.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?\u201d asks the reader. \u201cHad he not\r\nlong been a friend to you? Had he not given proof on proof of a certain\r\npartiality in his feelings?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYes, he had; but still I liked to hear him say so earnestly\u2014that he was my\r\nclose, true friend; I liked his modest doubts, his tender deference\u2014that trust\r\nwhich longed to rest, and was grateful when taught how. He had called me\r\n\u201csister.\u201d It was well. Yes; he might call me what he pleased, so long as he\r\nconfided in me. I was willing to be his sister, on condition that he did not\r\ninvite me to fill that relation to some future wife of his; and tacitly vowed\r\nas he was to celibacy, of this dilemma there seemed little danger.\r\n\n\r\nThrough most of the succeeding night I pondered that evening\u2019s interview. I\r\nwanted much the morning to break, and then listened for the bell to ring; and,\r\nafter rising and dressing, I deemed prayers and breakfast slow, and all the\r\nhours lingering, till that arrived at last which brought me the lesson of\r\nliterature. My wish was to get a more thorough comprehension of this fraternal\r\nalliance: to note with how much of the brother he would demean himself when we\r\nmet again; to prove how much of the sister was in my own feelings; to discover\r\nwhether I could summon a sister\u2019s courage, and he a brother\u2019s frankness.\r\n\n\r\nHe came. Life is so constructed, that the event does not, cannot, will not,\r\nmatch the expectation. That whole day he never accosted me. His lesson was\r\ngiven rather more quietly than usual, more mildly, and also more gravely. He\r\nwas fatherly to his pupils, but he was not brotherly to me. Ere he left the\r\nclasse, I expected a smile, if not a word; I got neither: to my portion fell\r\none nod\u2014hurried, shy.\r\n\n\r\nThis distance, I argued, is accidental\u2014it is involuntary; patience, and it will\r\nvanish. It vanished not; it continued for days; it increased. I suppressed my\r\nsurprise, and swallowed whatever other feelings began to surge.\r\n\n\r\nWell might I ask when he offered fraternity\u2014\u201cDare I rely on you?\u201d Well might\r\nhe, doubtless knowing himself, withhold all pledge. True, he had bid me make my\r\nown experiments\u2014tease and try him. Vain injunction! Privilege nominal and\r\nunavailable! Some women might use it! Nothing in my powers or instinct placed\r\nme amongst this brave band. Left alone, I was passive; repulsed, I withdrew;\r\nforgotten\u2014my lips would not utter, nor my eyes dart a reminder. It seemed there\r\nhad been an error somewhere in my calculations, and I wanted for time to\r\ndisclose it.\r\n\n\r\nBut the day came when, as usual, he was to give me a lesson. One evening in\r\nseven he had long generously bestowed on me, devoting it to the examination of\r\nwhat had been done in various studies during the past week, and to the\r\npreparation of work for the week in prospect. On these occasions my schoolroom\r\nwas anywhere, wherever the pupils and the other teachers happened to be, or in\r\ntheir close vicinage, very often in the large second division, where it was\r\neasy to choose a quiet nook when the crowding day pupils were absent, and the\r\nfew boarders gathered in a knot about the surveillante\u2019s estrade.\r\n\n\r\nOn the customary evening, hearing the customary hour strike, I collected my\r\nbooks and papers, my pen and ink, and sought the large division.\r\n\n\r\nIn classe there was no one, and it lay all in cool deep shadow; but through the\r\nopen double doors was seen the carr\u00e9, filled with pupils and with light; over\r\nhall and figures blushed the westering sun. It blushed so ruddily and vividly,\r\nthat the hues of the walls and the variegated tints of the dresses seemed all\r\nfused in one warm glow. The girls were seated, working or studying; in the\r\nmidst of their circle stood M. Emanuel, speaking good-humouredly to a teacher.\r\nHis dark palet\u00f4t, his jetty hair, were tinged with many a reflex of crimson;\r\nhis Spanish face, when he turned it momentarily, answered the sun\u2019s animated\r\nkiss with an animated smile. I took my place at a desk.\r\n\n\r\nThe orange-trees, and several plants, full and bright with bloom, basked also\r\nin the sun\u2019s laughing bounty; they had partaken it the whole day, and now asked\r\nwater. M. Emanuel had a taste for gardening; he liked to tend and foster\r\nplants. I used to think that working amongst shrubs with a spade or a\r\nwatering-pot soothed his nerves; it was a recreation to which he often had\r\nrecourse; and now he looked to the orange-trees, the geraniums, the gorgeous\r\ncactuses, and revived them all with the refreshment their drought needed. His\r\nlips meantime sustained his precious cigar, that (for him) first necessary and\r\nprime luxury of life; its blue wreaths curled prettily enough amongst the\r\nflowers, and in the evening light. He spoke no more to the pupils, nor to the\r\nmistresses, but gave many an endearing word to a small spanieless (if one may\r\ncoin a word), that nominally belonged to the house, but virtually owned him as\r\nmaster, being fonder of him than any inmate. A delicate, silky, loving, and\r\nlovable little doggie she was, trotting at his side, looking with expressive,\r\nattached eyes into his face; and whenever he dropped his bonnet-grec or his\r\nhandkerchief, which he occasionally did in play, crouching beside it with the\r\nair of a miniature lion guarding a kingdom\u2019s flag.\r\n\n\r\nThere were many plants, and as the amateur gardener fetched all the water from\r\nthe well in the court, with his own active hands, his work spun on to some\r\nlength. The great school-clock ticked on. Another hour struck. The carr\u00e9 and\r\nthe youthful group lost the illusion of sunset. Day was drooping. My lesson, I\r\nperceived, must to-night be very short; but the orange-trees, the cacti, the\r\ncamelias were all served now. Was it my turn?\r\n\n\r\nAlas! in the garden were more plants to be looked after,\u2014favourite rose-bushes,\r\ncertain choice flowers; little Sylvie\u2019s glad bark and whine followed the\r\nreceding palet\u00f4t down the alleys. I put up some of my books; I should not want\r\nthem all; I sat and thought; and waited, involuntarily deprecating the creeping\r\ninvasion of twilight.\r\n\n\r\nSylvie, gaily frisking, emerged into view once more, heralding the returning\r\npalet\u00f4t; the watering-pot was deposited beside the well; it had fulfilled its\r\noffice; how glad I was! Monsieur washed his hands in a little stone bowl. There\r\nwas no longer time for a lesson now; ere long the prayer-bell must ring; but\r\nstill we should meet; he would speak; a chance would be offered of reading in\r\nhis eyes the riddle of his shyness. His ablutions over, he stood, slowly\r\nre-arranging his cuffs, looking at the horn of a young moon, set pale in the\r\nopal sky, and glimmering faint on the oriel of Jean Baptiste. Sylvie watched\r\nthe mood contemplative; its stillness irked her; she whined and jumped to break\r\nit. He looked down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPetite exigeante,\u201d said he; \u201cyou must not be forgotten one moment, it seems.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped, lifted her in his arms, sauntered across the court, within a yard\r\nof the line of windows near one of which I sat: he sauntered lingeringly,\r\nfondling the spaniel in his bosom, calling her tender names in a tender voice.\r\nOn the front-door steps he turned; once again he looked at the moon, at the\r\ngrey cathedral, over the remoter spires and house-roofs fading into a blue sea\r\nof night-mist; he tasted the sweet breath of dusk, and noted the folded bloom\r\nof the garden; he suddenly looked round; a keen beam out of his eye rased the\r\nwhite fa\u00e7ade of the classes, swept the long line of crois\u00e9es. I think he bowed;\r\nif he did, I had no time to return the courtesy. In a moment he was gone; the\r\nmoonlit threshold lay pale and shadowless before the closed front door.\r\n\n\r\nGathering in my arms all that was spread on the desk before me, I carried back\r\nthe unused heap to its place in the third classe. The prayer-bell rang; I\r\nobeyed its summons.\r\n\n\r\nThe morrow would not restore him to the Rue Fossette, that day being devoted\r\nentirely to his college. I got through my teaching; I got over the intermediate\r\nhours; I saw evening approaching, and armed myself for its heavy ennuis.\r\nWhether it was worse to stay with my co-inmates, or to sit alone, I had not\r\nconsidered; I naturally took up the latter alternative; if there was a hope of\r\ncomfort for any moment, the heart or head of no human being in this house could\r\nyield it; only under the lid of my desk could it harbour, nestling between the\r\nleaves of some book, gilding a pencil-point, the nib of a pen, or tinging the\r\nblack fluid in that ink-glass. With a heavy heart I opened my desk-lid; with a\r\nweary hand I turned up its contents.\r\n\n\r\nOne by one, well-accustomed books, volumes sewn in familiar covers, were taken\r\nout and put back hopeless: they had no charm; they could not comfort. Is this\r\nsomething new, this pamphlet in lilac? I had not seen it before, and I\r\nre-arranged my desk this very day\u2014this very afternoon; the tract must have been\r\nintroduced within the last hour, while we were at dinner.\r\n\n\r\nI opened it. What was it? What would it say to me?\r\n\n\r\nIt was neither tale nor poem, neither essay nor history; it neither sung, nor\r\nrelated, not discussed. It was a theological work; it preached and it\r\npersuaded.\r\n\n\r\nI lent to it my ear very willingly, for, small as it was, it possessed its own\r\nspell, and bound my attention at once. It preached Romanism; it persuaded to\r\nconversion. The voice of that sly little book was a honeyed voice; its accents\r\nwere all unction and balm. Here roared no utterance of Rome\u2019s thunders, no\r\nblasting of the breath of her displeasure. The Protestant was to turn Papist,\r\nnot so much in fear of the heretic\u2019s hell, as on account of the comfort, the\r\nindulgence, the tenderness Holy Church offered: far be it from her to threaten\r\nor to coerce; her wish was to guide and win. She persecute? Oh dear no!\r\nnot on any account!\r\n\n\r\nThis meek volume was not addressed to the hardened and worldly; it was not even\r\nstrong meat for the strong: it was milk for babes: the mild effluence of a\r\nmother\u2019s love towards her tenderest and her youngest; intended wholly and\r\nsolely for those whose head is to be reached through the heart. Its appeal was\r\nnot to intellect; it sought to win the affectionate through their affections,\r\nthe sympathizing through their sympathies: St. Vincent de Paul, gathering his\r\norphans about him, never spoke more sweetly.\r\n\n\r\nI remember one capital inducement to apostacy was held out in the fact that the\r\nCatholic who had lost dear friends by death could enjoy the unspeakable solace\r\nof praying them out of purgatory. The writer did not touch on the firmer peace\r\nof those whose belief dispenses with purgatory altogether: but I thought of\r\nthis; and, on the whole, preferred the latter doctrine as the most consolatory.\r\nThe little book amused, and did not painfully displease me. It was a canting,\r\nsentimental, shallow little book, yet something about it cheered my gloom and\r\nmade me smile; I was amused with the gambols of this unlicked wolf-cub muffled\r\nin the fleece, and mimicking the bleat of a guileless lamb. Portions of it\r\nreminded me of certain Wesleyan Methodist tracts I had once read when a child;\r\nthey were flavoured with about the same seasoning of excitation to fanaticism.\r\nHe that had written it was no bad man, and while perpetually betraying the\r\ntrained cunning\u2014the cloven hoof of his system\u2014I should pause before accusing\r\nhimself of insincerity. His judgment, however, wanted surgical props; it was\r\nrickety.\r\n\n\r\nI smiled then over this dose of maternal tenderness, coming from the ruddy old\r\nlady of the Seven Hills; smiled, too, at my own disinclination, not to say\r\ndisability, to meet these melting favours. Glancing at the title-page, I found\r\nthe name of \u201cP\u00e8re Silas.\u201d A fly-leaf bore in small, but clear and well-known\r\npencil characters: \u201cFrom P. C. D. E. to L\u2014y.\u201d And when I saw this I laughed:\r\nbut not in my former spirit. I was revived.\r\n\n\r\nA mortal bewilderment cleared suddenly from my head and vision; the solution of\r\nthe Sphinx-riddle was won; the conjunction of those two names, P\u00e8re Silas and\r\nPaul Emanuel, gave the key to all. The penitent had been with his director;\r\npermitted to withhold nothing; suffered to keep no corner of his heart sacred\r\nto God and to himself; the whole narrative of our late interview had been drawn\r\nfrom him; he had avowed the covenant of fraternity, and spoken of his adopted\r\nsister. How could such a covenant, such adoption, be sanctioned by the Church?\r\nFraternal communion with a heretic! I seemed to hear P\u00e8re Silas annulling the\r\nunholy pact; warning his penitent of its perils; entreating, enjoining reserve,\r\nnay, by the authority of his office, and in the name, and by the memory of all\r\nM. Emanuel held most dear and sacred, commanding the enforcement of that new\r\nsystem whose frost had pierced to the marrow of my bones.\r\n\n\r\nThese may not seem pleasant hypotheses; yet, by comparison, they were welcome.\r\nThe vision of a ghostly troubler hovering in the background, was as nothing,\r\nmatched with the fear of spontaneous change arising in M. Paul himself.\r\n\n\r\nAt this distance of time, I cannot be sure how far the above conjectures were\r\nself-suggested: or in what measure they owed their origin and confirmation to\r\nanother quarter. Help was not wanting.\r\n\n\r\nThis evening there was no bright sunset: west and east were one cloud; no\r\nsummer night-mist, blue, yet rose-tinged, softened the distance; a clammy fog\r\nfrom the marshes crept grey round Villette. To-night the watering-pot might\r\nrest in its niche by the well: a small rain had been drizzling all the\r\nafternoon, and still it fell fast and quietly. This was no weather for rambling\r\nin the wet alleys, under the dripping trees; and I started to hear Sylvie\u2019s\r\nsudden bark in the garden\u2014her bark of welcome. Surely she was not accompanied\r\nand yet this glad, quick bark was never uttered, save in homage to one\r\npresence.\r\n\n\r\nThrough the glass door and the arching berceau, I commanded the deep vista of\r\nthe all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue: thither rushed Sylvie, glistening through its gloom like a\r\nwhite guelder-rose. She ran to and fro, whining, springing, harassing little\r\nbirds amongst the bushes. I watched five minutes; no fulfilment followed the\r\nomen. I returned to my books; Sylvie\u2019s sharp bark suddenly ceased. Again I\r\nlooked up. She was standing not many yards distant, wagging her white feathery\r\ntail as fast as the muscle would work, and intently watching the operations of\r\na spade, plied fast by an indefatigable hand. There was M. Emanuel, bent over\r\nthe soil, digging in the wet mould amongst the rain-laden and streaming shrubs,\r\nworking as hard as if his day\u2019s pittance were yet to earn by the literal sweat\r\nof his brow.\r\n\n\r\nIn this sign I read a ruffled mood. He would dig thus in frozen snow on the\r\ncoldest winter day, when urged inwardly by painful emotion, whether of nervous\r\nexcitation, or, sad thoughts of self-reproach. He would dig by the hour, with\r\nknit brow and set teeth, nor once lift his head, or open his lips.\r\n\n\r\nSylvie watched till she was tired. Again scampering devious, bounding here,\r\nrushing there, snuffing and sniffing everywhere; she at last discovered me in\r\nclasse. Instantly she flew barking at the panes, as if to urge me forth to\r\nshare her pleasure or her master\u2019s toil; she had seen me occasionally walking\r\nin that alley with M. Paul; and I doubt not, considered it my duty to join him\r\nnow, wet as it was.\r\n\n\r\nShe made such a bustle that M. Paul at last looked up, and of course perceived\r\nwhy, and at whom she barked. He whistled to call her off; she only barked the\r\nlouder. She seemed quite bent upon having the glass door opened. Tired, I\r\nsuppose, with her importunity, he threw down his spade, approached, and pushed\r\nthe door ajar. Sylvie burst in all impetuous, sprang to my lap, and with her\r\npaws at my neck, and her little nose and tongue somewhat overpoweringly busy\r\nabout my face, mouth, and eyes, flourished her bushy tail over the desk, and\r\nscattered books and papers far and wide.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel advanced to still the clamour and repair the disarrangement. Having\r\ngathered up the books, he captured Sylvie, and stowed her away under his\r\npalet\u00f4t, where she nestled as quiet as a mouse, her head just peeping forth.\r\nShe was very tiny, and had the prettiest little innocent face, the silkiest\r\nlong ears, the finest dark eyes in the world. I never saw her, but I thought of\r\nPaulina de Bassompierre: forgive the association, reader, it would\r\noccur.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul petted and patted her; the endearments she received were not to be\r\nwondered at; she invited affection by her beauty and her vivacious life.\r\n\n\r\nWhile caressing the spaniel, his eye roved over the papers and books just\r\nreplaced; it settled on the religious tract. His lips moved; he half checked\r\nthe impulse to speak. What! had he promised never to address me more? If so,\r\nhis better nature pronounced the vow \u201cmore honoured in the breach than in the\r\nobservance,\u201d for with a second effort, he spoke.\u2014\u201cYou have not yet read the\r\nbrochure, I presume? It is not sufficiently inviting?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI replied that I had read it.\r\n\n\r\nHe waited, as if wishing me to give an opinion upon it unasked. Unasked,\r\nhowever, I was in no mood to do or say anything. If any concessions were to be\r\nmade\u2014if any advances were demanded\u2014that was the affair of the very docile pupil\r\nof P\u00e8re Silas, not mine. His eye settled upon me gently: there was mildness at\r\nthe moment in its blue ray\u2014there was solicitude\u2014a shade of pathos; there were\r\nmeanings composite and contrasted\u2014reproach melting into remorse. At the moment\r\nprobably, he would have been glad to see something emotional in me. I could not\r\nshow it. In another minute, however, I should have betrayed confusion, had I\r\nnot bethought myself to take some quill-pens from my desk, and begin soberly to\r\nmend them.\r\n\n\r\nI knew that action would give a turn to his mood. He never liked to see me mend\r\npens; my knife was always dull-edged\u2014my hand, too, was unskilful; I hacked and\r\nchipped. On this occasion I cut my own finger\u2014half on purpose. I wanted to\r\nrestore him to his natural state, to set him at his ease, to get him to chide.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMaladroit!\u201d he cried at last, \u201cshe will make mincemeat of her hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe put Sylvie down, making her lie quiet beside his bonnet-grec, and, depriving\r\nme of the pens and penknife, proceeded to slice, nib, and point with the\r\naccuracy and celerity of a machine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid I like the little book?\u201d he now inquired.\r\n\n\r\nSuppressing a yawn, I said I hardly knew.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHad it moved me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought it had made me a little sleepy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(After a pause) \u201cAllons donc! It was of no use taking that tone with him. Bad\r\nas I was\u2014and he should be sorry to have to name all my faults at a breath\u2014God\r\nand nature had given me \u2018trop de sensibilit\u00e9 et de sympathie\u2019 not to be\r\nprofoundly affected by an appeal so touching.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I responded, rousing myself quickly, \u201cI was not affected at all\u2014not a\r\nwhit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd in proof, I drew from my pocket a perfectly dry handkerchief, still clean\r\nand in its folds.\r\n\n\r\nHereupon I was made the object of a string of strictures rather piquant than\r\npolite. I listened with zest. After those two days of unnatural silence, it was\r\nbetter than music to hear M. Paul haranguing again just in his old fashion. I\r\nlistened, and meantime solaced myself and Sylvie with the contents of a\r\nbonbonni\u00e8re, which M. Emanuel\u2019s gifts kept well supplied with chocolate\r\ncomfits: It pleased him to see even a small matter from his hand duly\r\nappreciated. He looked at me and the spaniel while we shared the spoil; he put\r\nup his penknife. Touching my hand with the bundle of new-cut quills, he\r\nsaid:\u2014\u201cDites donc, petite s\u0153ur\u2014speak frankly\u2014what have you thought of me\r\nduring the last two days?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut of this question I would take no manner of notice; its purport made my eyes\r\nfill. I caressed Sylvie assiduously. M. Paul, leaning\u2014over the desk, bent\r\ntowards me:\u2014\u201cI called myself your brother,\u201d he said: \u201cI hardly know what I\r\nam\u2014brother\u2014friend\u2014I cannot tell. I know I think of you\u2014I feel I wish, you\r\nwell\u2014but I must check myself; you are to be feared. My best friends point out\r\ndanger, and whisper caution.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou do right to listen to your friends. By all means be cautious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is your religion\u2014your strange, self-reliant, invulnerable creed, whose\r\ninfluence seems to clothe you in, I know not what, unblessed panoply. You are\r\ngood\u2014P\u00e8re Silas calls you good, and loves you\u2014but your terrible, proud, earnest\r\nProtestantism, there is the danger. It expresses itself by your eye at times;\r\nand again, it gives you certain tones and certain gestures that make my flesh\r\ncreep. You are not demonstrative, and yet, just now\u2014when you handled that\r\ntract\u2014my God! I thought Lucifer smiled.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I don\u2019t respect that tract\u2014what then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot respect that tract? But it is the pure essence of faith, love, charity! I\r\nthought it would touch you: in its gentleness, I trusted that it could not\r\nfail. I laid it in your desk with a prayer: I must indeed be a sinner: Heaven\r\nwill not hear the petitions that come warmest from my heart. You scorn my\r\nlittle offering. Oh, cela me fait mal!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, I don\u2019t scorn it\u2014at least, not as your gift. Monsieur, sit down;\r\nlisten to me. I am not a heathen, I am not hard-hearted, I am not unchristian,\r\nI am not dangerous, as they tell you; I would not trouble your faith; you\r\nbelieve in God and Christ and the Bible, and so do I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut do you believe in the Bible? Do you receive Revelation? What limits\r\nare there to the wild, careless daring of your country and sect. P\u00e8re Silas\r\ndropped dark hints.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBy dint of persuasion, I made him half-define these hints; they amounted to\r\ncrafty Jesuit-slanders. That night M. Paul and I talked seriously and closely.\r\nHe pleaded, he argued. I could not argue\u2014a fortunate incapacity; it\r\nneeded but triumphant, logical opposition to effect all the director wished to\r\nbe effected; but I could talk in my own way\u2014the way M. Paul was used to\u2014and of\r\nwhich he could follow the meanderings and fill the hiatus, and pardon the\r\nstrange stammerings, strange to him no longer. At ease with him, I could defend\r\nmy creed and faith in my own fashion; in some degree I could lull his\r\nprejudices. He was not satisfied when he went away, hardly was he appeased; but\r\nhe was made thoroughly to feel that Protestants were not necessarily the\r\nirreverent Pagans his director had insinuated; he was made to comprehend\r\nsomething of their mode of honouring the Light, the Life, the Word; he was\r\nenabled partly to perceive that, while their veneration for things venerable\r\nwas not quite like that cultivated in his Church, it had its own, perhaps,\r\ndeeper power\u2014its own more solemn awe.\r\n\n\r\nI found that P\u00e8re Silas (himself, I must repeat, not a bad man, though the\r\nadvocate of a bad cause) had darkly stigmatized Protestants in general, and\r\nmyself by inference, with strange names, had ascribed to us strange \u201cisms;\u201d\r\nMonsieur Emanuel revealed all this in his frank fashion, which knew not\r\nsecretiveness, looking at me as he spoke with a kind, earnest fear, almost\r\ntrembling lest there should be truth in the charges. P\u00e8re Silas, it seems, had\r\nclosely watched me, had ascertained that I went by turns, and indiscriminately,\r\nto the three Protestant Chapels of Villette\u2014the French, German, and\r\nEnglish\u2014id est, the Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopalian. Such\r\nliberality argued in the father\u2019s eyes profound indifference\u2014who tolerates all,\r\nhe reasoned, can be attached to none. Now, it happened that I had often\r\nsecretly wondered at the minute and unimportant character of the differences\r\nbetween these three sects\u2014at the unity and identity of their vital doctrines: I\r\nsaw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused into one grand Holy\r\nAlliance, and I respected them all, though I thought that in each there were\r\nfaults of form, incumbrances, and trivialities. Just what I thought, that did I\r\ntell M. Emanuel, and explained to him that my own last appeal, the guide to\r\nwhich I looked, and the teacher which I owned, must always be the Bible itself,\r\nrather than any sect, of whatever name or nation.\r\n\n\r\nHe left me soothed, yet full of solicitude, breathing a wish, as strong as a\r\nprayer, that if I were wrong, Heaven would lead me right. I heard, poured forth\r\non the threshold, some fervid murmurings to \u201cMarie, Reine du Ciel,\u201d some deep\r\naspiration that his hope might yet be mine.\r\n\n\r\nStrange! I had no such feverish wish to turn him from the faith of his fathers.\r\nI thought Romanism wrong, a great mixed image of gold and clay; but it seemed\r\nto me that this Romanist held the purer elements of his creed with an\r\ninnocency of heart which God must love.\r\n\n\r\nThe preceding conversation passed between eight and nine o\u2019clock of the\r\nevening, in a schoolroom of the quiet Rue Fossette, opening on a sequestered\r\ngarden. Probably about the same, or a somewhat later hour of the succeeding\r\nevening, its echoes, collected by holy obedience, were breathed verbatim in an\r\nattent ear, at the panel of a confessional, in the hoary church of the Magi. It\r\nensued that P\u00e8re Silas paid a visit to Madame Beck, and stirred by I know not\r\nwhat mixture of motives, persuaded her to let him undertake for a time the\r\nEnglishwoman\u2019s spiritual direction.\r\n\n\r\nHereupon I was put through a course of reading\u2014that is, I just glanced at the\r\nbooks lent me; they were too little in my way to be thoroughly read, marked,\r\nlearned, or inwardly digested. And besides, I had a book up-stairs, under my\r\npillow, whereof certain chapters satisfied my needs in the article of spiritual\r\nlore, furnishing such precept and example as, to my heart\u2019s core, I was\r\nconvinced could not be improved on.\r\n\n\r\nThen P\u00e8re Silas showed me the fair side of Rome, her good works; and bade me\r\njudge the tree by its fruits.\r\n\n\r\nIn answer, I felt and I avowed that these works were not the fruits of\r\nRome; they were but her abundant blossoming, but the fair promise she showed\r\nthe world, that bloom when set, savoured not of charity; the apple full formed\r\nwas ignorance, abasement, and bigotry. Out of men\u2019s afflictions and affections\r\nwere forged the rivets of their servitude. Poverty was fed and clothed, and\r\nsheltered, to bind it by obligation to \u201cthe Church;\u201d orphanage was reared and\r\neducated that it might grow up in the fold of \u201cthe Church;\u201d sickness was tended\r\nthat it might die after the formula and in the ordinance of \u201cthe Church;\u201d and\r\nmen were overwrought, and women most murderously sacrificed, and all laid down\r\na world God made pleasant for his creatures\u2019 good, and took up a cross,\r\nmonstrous in its galling weight, that they might serve Rome, prove her\r\nsanctity, confirm her power, and spread the reign of her tyrant \u201cChurch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor man\u2019s good was little done; for God\u2019s glory, less. A thousand ways were\r\nopened with pain, with blood-sweats, with lavishing of life; mountains were\r\ncloven through their breasts, and rocks were split to their base; and all for\r\nwhat? That a Priesthood might march straight on and straight upward to an\r\nall-dominating eminence, whence they might at last stretch the sceptre of their\r\nMoloch \u201cChurch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt will not be. God is not with Rome, and, were human sorrows still for the Son\r\nof God, would he not mourn over her cruelties and ambitions, as once he mourned\r\nover the crimes and woes of doomed Jerusalem!\r\n\n\r\nOh, lovers of power! Oh, mitred aspirants for this world\u2019s kingdoms! an hour\r\nwill come, even to you, when it will be well for your hearts\u2014pausing faint at\r\neach broken beat\u2014that there is a Mercy beyond human compassions, a Love,\r\nstronger than this strong death which even you must face, and before it, fall;\r\na Charity more potent than any sin, even yours; a Pity which redeems\r\nworlds\u2014nay, absolves Priests.\r\n\n\r\nMy third temptation was held out in the pomp of Rome\u2014the glory of her kingdom.\r\nI was taken to the churches on solemn occasions\u2014days of f\u00eate and state; I was\r\nshown the Papal ritual and ceremonial. I looked at it.\r\n\n\r\nMany people\u2014men and women\u2014no doubt far my superiors in a thousand ways, have\r\nfelt this display impressive, have declared that though their Reason protested,\r\ntheir Imagination was subjugated. I cannot say the same. Neither full\r\nprocession, nor high mass, nor swarming tapers, nor swinging censers, nor\r\necclesiastical millinery, nor celestial jewellery, touched my imagination a\r\nwhit. What I saw struck me as tawdry, not grand; as grossly material, not\r\npoetically spiritual.\r\n\n\r\nThis I did not tell P\u00e8re Silas; he was old, he looked venerable: through every\r\nabortive experiment, under every repeated disappointment, he remained\r\npersonally kind to me, and I felt tender of hurting his feelings. But on the\r\nevening of a certain day when, from the balcony of a great house, I had been\r\nmade to witness a huge mingled procession of the church and the army\u2014priests\r\nwith relics, and soldiers with weapons, an obese and aged archbishop, habited\r\nin cambric and lace, looking strangely like a grey daw in bird-of-paradise\r\nplumage, and a band of young girls fantastically robed and\r\ngarlanded\u2014then I spoke my mind to M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did not like it,\u201d I told him; \u201cI did not respect such ceremonies; I wished\r\nto see no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd having relieved my conscience by this declaration, I was able to go on,\r\nand, speaking more currently and clearly than my wont, to show him that I had a\r\nmind to keep to my reformed creed; the more I saw of Popery the closer I clung\r\nto Protestantism; doubtless there were errors in every church, but I now\r\nperceived by contrast how severely pure was my own, compared with her whose\r\npainted and meretricious face had been unveiled for my admiration. I told him\r\nhow we kept fewer forms between us and God; retaining, indeed, no more than,\r\nperhaps, the nature of mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due\r\nobservance. I told him I could not look on flowers and tinsel, on wax-lights\r\nand embroidery, at such times and under such circumstances as should be devoted\r\nto lifting the secret vision to Him whose home is Infinity, and His\r\nbeing\u2014Eternity. That when I thought of sin and sorrow, of earthly corruption,\r\nmortal depravity, weighty temporal woe\u2014I could not care for chanting priests or\r\nmumming officials; that when the pains of existence and the terrors of\r\ndissolution pressed before me\u2014when the mighty hope and measureless doubt of the\r\nfuture arose in view\u2014then, even the scientific strain, or the prayer in\r\na language learned and dead, harassed: with hindrance a heart which only longed\r\nto cry\u2014\u201cGod be merciful to me, a sinner!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had so spoken, so declared my faith, and so widely severed myself, from\r\nhim I addressed\u2014then, at last, came a tone accordant, an echo responsive, one\r\nsweet chord of harmony in two conflicting spirits.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhatever say priests or controversialists,\u201d murmured M. Emanuel, \u201cGod is good,\r\nand loves all the sincere. Believe, then, what you can; believe it as you can;\r\none prayer, at least, we have in common; I also cry\u2014\u2018O Dieu, sois appais\u00e9\r\nenvers moi qui suis p\u00e9cheur!\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe leaned on the back of my chair. After some thought he again spoke:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow seem in the eyes of that God who made all firmaments, from whose nostrils\r\nissued whatever of life is here, or in the stars shining yonder\u2014how seem the\r\ndifferences of man? But as Time is not for God, nor Space, so neither is\r\nMeasure, nor Comparison. We abase ourselves in our littleness, and we do right;\r\nyet it may be that the constancy of one heart, the truth and faith of one mind\r\naccording to the light He has appointed, import as much to Him as the just\r\nmotion of satellites about their planets, of planets about their suns, of suns\r\naround that mighty unseen centre incomprehensible, irrealizable, with strange\r\nmental effort only divined.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod guide us all! God bless you, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n"}
{"38": "\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nSUNSHINE.\n\r\nIt was very well for Paulina to decline further correspondence with Graham till\r\nher father had sanctioned the intercourse. But Dr. Bretton could not live\r\nwithin a league of the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy, and not contrive to visit there often. Both\r\nlovers meant at first, I believe, to be distant; they kept their intention so\r\nfar as demonstrative courtship went, but in feeling they soon drew very near.\r\n\n\r\nAll that was best in Graham sought Paulina; whatever in him was noble, awoke,\r\nand grew in her presence. With his past admiration of Miss Fanshawe, I suppose\r\nhis intellect had little to do, but his whole intellect, and his highest\r\ntastes, came in question now. These, like all his faculties, were active, eager\r\nfor nutriment, and alive to gratification when it came.\r\n\n\r\nI cannot say that Paulina designedly led him to talk of books, or formally\r\nproposed to herself for a moment the task of winning him to reflection, or\r\nplanned the improvement of his mind, or so much as fancied his mind could in\r\nany one respect be improved. She thought him very perfect; it was Graham\r\nhimself, who, at first by the merest chance, mentioned some book he had been\r\nreading, and when in her response sounded a welcome harmony of sympathies,\r\nsomething, pleasant to his soul, he talked on, more and better perhaps than he\r\nhad ever talked before on such subjects. She listened with delight, and\r\nanswered with animation. In each successive answer, Graham heard a music waxing\r\nfiner and finer to his sense; in each he found a suggestive, persuasive, magic\r\naccent that opened a scarce-known treasure-house within, showed him unsuspected\r\npower in his own mind, and what was better, latent goodness in his heart. Each\r\nliked the way in which the other talked; the voice, the diction, the expression\r\npleased; each keenly relished the flavour of the other\u2019s wit; they met each\r\nother\u2019s meaning with strange quickness, their thoughts often matched like\r\ncarefully-chosen pearls. Graham had wealth of mirth by nature; Paulina\r\npossessed no such inherent flow of animal spirits\u2014unstimulated, she inclined to\r\nbe thoughtful and pensive\u2014but now she seemed merry as a lark; in her lover\u2019s\r\ngenial presence, she glanced like some soft glad light. How beautiful she grew\r\nin her happiness, I can hardly express, but I wondered to see her. As to that\r\ngentle ice of hers\u2014that reserve on which she had depended; where was it now?\r\nAh! Graham would not long bear it; he brought with him a generous influence\r\nthat soon thawed the timid, self-imposed restriction.\r\n\n\r\nNow were the old Bretton days talked over; perhaps brokenly at first, with a\r\nsort of smiling diffidence, then with opening candour and still growing\r\nconfidence. Graham had made for himself a better opportunity than that he had\r\nwished me to give; he had earned independence of the collateral help that\r\ndisobliging Lucy had refused; all his reminiscences of \u201clittle Polly\u201d found\r\ntheir proper expression in his own pleasant tones, by his own kind and handsome\r\nlips; how much better than if suggested by me.\r\n\n\r\nMore than once when we were alone, Paulina would tell me how wonderful and\r\ncurious it was to discover the richness and accuracy of his memory in this\r\nmatter. How, while he was looking at her, recollections would seem to be\r\nsuddenly quickened in his mind. He reminded her that she had once gathered his\r\nhead in her arms, caressed his leonine graces, and cried out, \u201cGraham, I\r\ndo like you!\u201d He told her how she would set a footstool beside him, and\r\nclimb by its aid to his knee. At this day he said he could recall the sensation\r\nof her little hands smoothing his cheek, or burying themselves in his thick\r\nmane. He remembered the touch of her small forefinger, placed half tremblingly,\r\nhalf curiously, in the cleft in his chin, the lisp, the look with which she\r\nwould name it \u201ca pretty dimple,\u201d then seek his eyes and question why they\r\npierced so, telling him he had a \u201cnice, strange face; far nicer, far stranger,\r\nthan either his mamma or Lucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cChild as I was,\u201d remarked Paulina, \u201cI wonder how I dared be so venturous. To\r\nme he seems now all sacred, his locks are inaccessible, and, Lucy, I feel a\r\nsort of fear, when I look at his firm, marble chin, at his straight Greek\r\nfeatures. Women are called beautiful, Lucy; he is not like a woman, therefore I\r\nsuppose he is not beautiful, but what is he, then? Do other people see him with\r\nmy eyes? Do you admire him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I do, Paulina,\u201d was once my answer to her many questions.\r\n\u201cI never see him. I looked at him twice or thrice about a year ago,\r\nbefore he recognised me, and then I shut my eyes; and if he were to cross their\r\nballs twelve times between each day\u2019s sunset and sunrise, except from memory, I\r\nshould hardly know what shape had gone by.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, what do you mean?\u201d said she, under her breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean that I value vision, and dread being struck stone blind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was best to answer her strongly at once, and to silence for ever the tender,\r\npassionate confidences which left her lips sweet honey, and sometimes dropped\r\nin my ear\u2014molten lead. To me, she commented no more on her lover\u2019s beauty.\r\n\n\r\nYet speak of him she would; sometimes shyly, in quiet, brief phrases; sometimes\r\nwith a tenderness of cadence, and music of voice exquisite in itself; but which\r\nchafed me at times miserably; and then, I know, I gave her stern looks and\r\nwords; but cloudless happiness had dazzled her native clear sight, and she only\r\nthought Lucy\u2014fitful.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpartan girl! Proud Lucy!\u201d she would say, smiling at me. \u201cGraham says you are\r\nthe most peculiar, capricious little woman he knows; but yet you are excellent;\r\nwe both think so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou both think you know not what,\u201d said I. \u201cHave the goodness to make me as\r\nlittle the subject of your mutual talk and thoughts as possible. I have my sort\r\nof life apart from yours.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut ours, Lucy, is a beautiful life, or it will be; and you shall share it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall share no man\u2019s or woman\u2019s life in this world, as you understand\r\nsharing. I think I have one friend of my own, but am not sure; and till I\r\nam sure, I live solitary.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut solitude is sadness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; it is sadness. Life, however; has worse than that. Deeper than\r\nmelancholy, lies heart-break.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, I wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you altogether.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere is, in lovers, a certain infatuation of egotism; they will have a witness\r\nof their happiness, cost that witness what it may. Paulina had forbidden\r\nletters, yet Dr. Bretton wrote; she had resolved against correspondence, yet\r\nshe answered, were it only to chide. She showed me these letters; with\r\nsomething of the spoiled child\u2019s wilfulness, and of the heiress\u2019s\r\nimperiousness, she made me read them. As I read Graham\u2019s, I scarce\r\nwondered at her exaction, and understood her pride: they were fine\r\nletters\u2014manly and fond\u2014modest and gallant. Hers must have appeared to him\r\nbeautiful. They had not been written to show her talents; still less, I think,\r\nto express her love. On the contrary, it appeared that she had proposed to\r\nherself the task of hiding that feeling, and bridling her lover\u2019s ardour. But\r\nhow could such letters serve such a purpose? Graham was become dear as her\r\nlife; he drew her like a powerful magnet. For her there was influence\r\nunspeakable in all he uttered, wrote, thought, or looked. With this unconfessed\r\nconfession, her letters glowed; it kindled them, from greeting to adieu.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish papa knew; I do wish papa knew!\u201d began now to be her anxious\r\nmurmur. \u201cI wish, and yet I fear. I can hardly keep Graham back from telling\r\nhim. There is nothing I long for more than to have this affair settled\u2014to speak\r\nout candidly; and yet I dread the crisis. I know, I am certain, papa will be\r\nangry at the first; I fear he will dislike me almost; it will seem to him an\r\nuntoward business; it will be a surprise, a shock: I can hardly foresee its\r\nwhole effect on him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe fact was\u2014her father, long calm, was beginning to be a little stirred: long\r\nblind on one point, an importunate light was beginning to trespass on his eye.\r\n\n\r\nTo her, he said nothing; but when she was not looking at, or perhaps\r\nthinking of him, I saw him gaze and meditate on her.\r\n\n\r\nOne evening\u2014Paulina was in her dressing-room, writing, I believe, to Graham;\r\nshe had left me in the library, reading\u2014M. de Bassompierre came in; he sat\r\ndown: I was about to withdraw; he requested me to remain\u2014gently, yet in a\r\nmanner which showed he wished compliance. He had taken his seat near the\r\nwindow, at a distance from me; he opened a desk; he took from it what looked\r\nlike a memorandum-book; of this book he studied a certain entry for several\r\nminutes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMiss Snowe,\u201d said he, laying it down, \u201cdo you know my little girl\u2019s age?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout eighteen, is it not, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so. This old pocket-book tells me she was born on the 5th of May, in\r\nthe year 18\u2014, eighteen years ago. It is strange; I had lost the just reckoning\r\nof her age. I thought of her as twelve\u2014fourteen\u2014an indefinite date; but she\r\nseemed a child.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is about eighteen,\u201d I repeated. \u201cShe is grown up; she will be no taller.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy little jewel!\u201d said M. de Bassompierre, in a tone which penetrated like\r\nsome of his daughter\u2019s accents.\r\n\n\r\nHe sat very thoughtful.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, don\u2019t grieve,\u201d I said; for I knew his feelings, utterly unspoken as they\r\nwere.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is the only pearl I have,\u201d he said; \u201cand now others will find out that she\r\nis pure and of price: they will covet her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI made no answer. Graham Bretton had dined with us that day; he had shone both\r\nin converse and looks: I know not what pride of bloom embellished his aspect\r\nand mellowed his intercourse. Under the stimulus of a high hope, something had\r\nunfolded in his whole manner which compelled attention. I think he had purposed\r\non that day to indicate the origin of his endeavours, and the aim of his\r\nambition. M. de Bassompierre had found himself forced, in a manner, to descry\r\nthe direction and catch the character of his homage. Slow in remarking, he was\r\nlogical in reasoning: having once seized the thread, it had guided him through\r\na long labyrinth.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is up-stairs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is writing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe writes, does she? Does she receive letters?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone but such as she can show me. And\u2014sir\u2014she\u2014they have long wanted to\r\nconsult you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They don\u2019t think of me\u2014an old father! I am in the way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, M. de Bassompierre\u2014not so\u2014that can\u2019t be! But Paulina must speak for\r\nherself: and Dr. Bretton, too, must be his own advocate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little late. Matters are advanced, it seems.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, till you approve, nothing is done\u2014only they love each other.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly!\u201d he echoed.\r\n\n\r\nInvested by fate with the part of confidante and mediator, I was obliged to go\r\non: \u201cHundreds of times has Dr. Bretton been on the point of appealing to you,\r\nsir; but, with all his high courage, he fears you mortally.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe may well\u2014he may well fear me. He has touched the best thing I have. Had he\r\nbut let her alone, she would have remained a child for years yet. So. Are they\r\nengaged?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey could not become engaged without your permission.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is well for you, Miss Snowe, to talk and think with that propriety which\r\nalways characterizes you; but this matter is a grief to me; my little girl was\r\nall I had: I have no more daughters and no son; Bretton might as well have\r\nlooked elsewhere; there are scores of rich and pretty women who would not, I\r\ndaresay, dislike him: he has looks, and conduct, and connection. Would nothing\r\nserve him but my Polly?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf he had never seen your \u2018Polly,\u2019 others might and would have pleased\r\nhim\u2014your niece, Miss Fanshawe, for instance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! I would have given him Ginevra with all my heart; but Polly!\u2014I can\u2019t let\r\nhim have her. No\u2014I can\u2019t. He is not her equal,\u201d he affirmed, rather gruffly.\r\n\u201cIn what particular is he her match? They talk of fortune! I am not an\r\navaricious or interested man, but the world thinks of these things\u2014and Polly\r\nwill be rich.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is known,\u201d said I: \u201call Villette knows her as an heiress.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo they talk of my little girl in that light?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey do, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe fell into deep thought. I ventured to say, \u201cWould you, sir, think any one\r\nPaulina\u2019s match? Would you prefer any other to Dr. Bretton? Do you think higher\r\nrank or more wealth would make much difference in your feelings towards a\r\nfuture son-in-law?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou touch me there,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook at the aristocracy of Villette\u2014you would not like them, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should not\u2014never a duc, baron, or vicomte of the lot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am told many of these persons think about her, sir,\u201d I went on, gaining\r\ncourage on finding that I met attention rather than repulse. \u201cOther suitors\r\nwill come, therefore, if Dr. Bretton is refused. Wherever you go, I suppose,\r\naspirants will not be wanting. Independent of heiress-ship, it appears to me\r\nthat Paulina charms most of those who see her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes she? How? My little girl is not thought a beauty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, Miss de Bassompierre is very beautiful.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u2014begging your pardon, Miss Snowe, but I think you are too partial. I\r\nlike Polly: I like all her ways and all her looks\u2014but then I am her father; and\r\neven I never thought about beauty. She is amusing, fairy-like, interesting to\r\nme;\u2014you must be mistaken in supposing her handsome?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe attracts, sir: she would attract without the advantages of your wealth and\r\nposition.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy wealth and position! Are these any bait to Graham? If I thought so\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bretton knows these points perfectly, as you may be sure, M. de\r\nBassompierre, and values them as any gentleman would\u2014as you would\r\nyourself, under the same circumstances\u2014but they are not his baits. He loves\r\nyour daughter very much; he feels her finest qualities, and they influence him\r\nworthily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! has my little pet \u2018fine qualities?\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, sir! did you observe her that evening when so many men of eminence and\r\nlearning dined here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI certainly was rather struck and surprised with her manner that day; its\r\nwomanliness made me smile.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you see those accomplished Frenchmen gather round her in the\r\ndrawing-room?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did; but I thought it was by way of relaxation\u2014as one might amuse one\u2019s self\r\nwith a pretty infant.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, she demeaned herself with distinction; and I heard the French gentlemen\r\nsay she was \u2018p\u00e9trie d\u2019esprit et de graces.\u2019 Dr. Bretton thought the same.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is a good, dear child, that is certain; and I do believe she has\r\nsome character. When I think of it, I was once ill; Polly nursed me; they\r\nthought I should die; she, I recollect, grew at once stronger and tenderer as I\r\ngrew worse in health. And as I recovered, what a sunbeam she was in my\r\nsick-room! Yes; she played about my chair as noiselessly and as cheerful as\r\nlight. And now she is sought in marriage! I don\u2019t want to part with her,\u201d said\r\nhe, and he groaned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have known Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long,\u201d I suggested, \u201cit would be less\r\nlike separation to give her to him than to another.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe reflected rather gloomily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTrue. I have long known Louisa Bretton,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe and I are indeed\r\nold, old friends; a sweet, kind girl she was when she was young. You talk of\r\nbeauty, Miss Snowe! she was handsome, if you will\u2014tall, straight, and\r\nblooming\u2014not the mere child or elf my Polly seems to me: at eighteen, Louisa\r\nhad a carriage and stature fit for a princess. She is a comely and a good woman\r\nnow. The lad is like her; I have always thought so, and favoured and wished him\r\nwell. Now he repays me by this robbery! My little treasure used to love her old\r\nfather dearly and truly. It is all over now, doubtless\u2014I am an incumbrance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe door opened\u2014his \u201clittle treasure\u201d came in. She was dressed, so to speak, in\r\nevening beauty; that animation which sometimes comes with the close of day,\r\nwarmed her eye and cheek; a tinge of summer crimson heightened her complexion;\r\nher curls fell full and long on her lily neck; her white dress suited the heat\r\nof June. Thinking me alone, she had brought in her hand the letter just\r\nwritten\u2014brought it folded but unsealed. I was to read it. When she saw her\r\nfather, her tripping step faltered a little, paused a moment\u2014the colour in her\r\ncheek flowed rosy over her whole face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPolly,\u201d said M. de Bassompierre, in a low voice, with a grave smile, \u201cdo you\r\nblush at seeing papa? That is something new.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t blush\u2014I never do blush,\u201d affirmed she, while another eddy from\r\nthe heart sent up its scarlet. \u201cBut I thought you were in the dining-room, and\r\nI wanted Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou thought I was with John Graham Bretton, I suppose? But he has just been\r\ncalled out: he will be back soon, Polly. He can post your letter for you; it\r\nwill save Matthieu a \u2018course,\u2019 as he calls it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t post letters,\u201d said she, rather pettishly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you do with them, then?\u2014come here and tell me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBoth her mind and gesture seemed to hesitate a second\u2014to say \u201cShall I\r\ncome?\u201d\u2014but she approached.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long is it since you became a letter-writer, Polly? It only seems\r\nyesterday when you were at your pot-hooks, labouring away absolutely with both\r\nhands at the pen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, they are not letters to send to the post in your letter-bag; they are\r\nonly notes, which I give now and then into the person\u2019s hands, just to\r\nsatisfy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe person! That means Miss Snowe, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa\u2014not Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho then? Perhaps Mrs. Bretton?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, papa\u2014not Mrs. Bretton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho, then, my little daughter? Tell papa the truth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, papa!\u201d she cried with earnestness, \u201cI will\u2014I will tell you the\r\ntruth\u2014all the truth; I am glad to tell you\u2014glad, though I tremble.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe did tremble: growing excitement, kindling feeling, and also\r\ngathering courage, shook her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hate to hide my actions from you, papa. I fear you and love you above\r\neverything but God. Read the letter; look at the address.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe laid it on his knee. He took it up and read it through; his hand shaking,\r\nhis eyes glistening meantime.\r\n\n\r\nHe re-folded it, and viewed the writer with a strange, tender, mournful amaze.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan she write so\u2014the little thing that stood at my knee but yesterday?\r\nCan she feel so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, is it wrong? Does it pain you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it, my innocent little Mary; but it pains me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, papa, listen! You shall not be pained by me. I would give up\r\neverything\u2014almost\u201d (correcting herself); \u201cI would die rather than make you\r\nunhappy; that would be too wicked!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes the letter not please you? Must it not go? Must it be torn? It shall, for\r\nyour sake, if you order it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI order nothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOrder something, papa; express your wish; only don\u2019t hurt, don\u2019t grieve\r\nGraham. I cannot, cannot bear that. I love you, papa; but I love Graham\r\ntoo\u2014because\u2014because\u2014it is impossible to help it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis splendid Graham is a young scamp, Polly\u2014that is my present notion of him:\r\nit will surprise you to hear that, for my part, I do not love him one whit. Ah!\r\nyears ago I saw something in that lad\u2019s eye I never quite fathomed\u2014something\r\nhis mother has not\u2014a depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too\r\nfar; now, suddenly, I find myself taken over the crown of the head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, you don\u2019t\u2014you have not fallen in; you are safe on the bank; you can do\r\nas you please; your power is despotic; you can shut me up in a convent, and\r\nbreak Graham\u2019s heart to-morrow, if you choose to be so cruel. Now, autocrat,\r\nnow czar, will you do this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOff with him to Siberia, red whiskers and all; I say, I don\u2019t like him, Polly,\r\nand I wonder that you should.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa,\u201d said she, \u201cdo you know you are very naughty? I never saw you look so\r\ndisagreeable, so unjust, so almost vindictive before. There is an expression in\r\nyour face which does not belong to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOff with him!\u201d pursued Mr. Home, who certainly did look sorely crossed and\r\nannoyed\u2014even a little bitter; \u201cbut, I suppose, if he went, Polly would pack a\r\nbundle and run after him; her heart is fairly won\u2014won, and weaned from her old\r\nfather.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I say it is naughty, it is decidedly wrong, to talk in that way. I am\r\nnot weaned from you, and no human being and no mortal influence\r\ncan wean me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe married, Polly! Espouse the red whiskers. Cease to be a daughter; go and be\r\na wife!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRed whiskers! I wonder what you mean, papa. You should take care of prejudice.\r\nYou sometimes say to me that all the Scotch, your countrymen, are the victims\r\nof prejudice. It is proved now, I think, when no distinction is to be made\r\nbetween red and deep nut-brown.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave the prejudiced old Scotchman; go away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe stood looking at him a minute. She wanted to show firmness, superiority to\r\ntaunts; knowing her father\u2019s character, guessing his few foibles, she had\r\nexpected the sort of scene which was now transpiring; it did not take her by\r\nsurprise, and she desired to let it pass with dignity, reliant upon reaction.\r\nHer dignity stood her in no stead. Suddenly her soul melted in her eyes; she\r\nfell on his neck:\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t leave you, papa; I\u2019ll never leave you. I won\u2019t pain\r\nyou! I\u2019ll never pain you!\u201d was her cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy lamb! my treasure!\u201d murmured the loving though rugged sire. He said no more\r\nfor the moment; indeed, those two words were hoarse.\r\n\n\r\nThe room was now darkening. I heard a movement, a step without. Thinking it\r\nmight be a servant coming with candles, I gently opened, to prevent intrusion.\r\nIn the ante-room stood no servant: a tall gentleman was placing his hat on the\r\ntable, drawing off his gloves slowly\u2014lingering, waiting, it seemed to me. He\r\ncalled me neither by sign nor word; yet his eye said:\u2014\u201cLucy, come here.\u201d And I\r\nwent.\r\n\n\r\nOver his face a smile flowed, while he looked down on me: no temper, save his\r\nown, would have expressed by a smile the sort of agitation which now fevered\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cM. de Bassompierre is there\u2014is he not?\u201d he inquired, pointing to the library.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe noticed me at dinner? He understood me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am brought up for judgment, then, and so is she?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Home\u201d (we now and always continued to term him Mr. Home at times) \u201cis\r\ntalking to his daughter.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! These are sharp moments, Lucy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was quite stirred up; his young hand trembled; a vital (I was going to write\r\nmortal, but such words ill apply to one all living like him)\u2014a vital\r\nsuspense now held, now hurried, his breath: in all this trouble his smile never\r\nfaded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs he very angry, Lucy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is very faithful, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will be done unto me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGraham, your star must be fortunate.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust it? Kind prophet! So cheered, I should be a faint heart indeed to quail.\r\nI think I find all women faithful, Lucy. I ought to love them, and I do. My\r\nmother is good; she is divine; and you are true as steel. Are you\r\nnot?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, Graham.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen give me thy hand, my little god-sister: it is a friendly little hand to\r\nme, and always has been. And now for the great venture. God be with the right.\r\nLucy, say Amen!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe turned, and waited till I said \u201cAmen!\u201d\u2014which I did to please him: the old\r\ncharm, in doing as he bid me, came back. I wished him success; and successful I\r\nknew he would be. He was born victor, as some are born vanquished.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFollow me!\u201d he said; and I followed him into Mr. Home\u2019s presence.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat is my sentence?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe father looked at him: the daughter kept her face hid.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Bretton,\u201d said Mr. Home, \u201cyou have given me the usual reward of\r\nhospitality. I entertained you; you have taken my best. I was always glad to\r\nsee you; you were glad to see the one precious thing I had. You spoke me fair;\r\nand, meantime, I will not say you robbed me, but I am bereaved, and what\r\nI have lost, you, it seems, have won.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I cannot repent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRepent! Not you! You triumph, no doubt: John Graham, you descended partly from\r\na Highlander and a chief, and there is a trace of the Celt in all you look,\r\nspeak, and think. You have his cunning and his charm. The red\u2014(Well then,\r\nPolly, the fair) hair, the tongue of guile, and brain of wile, are all\r\ncome down by inheritance.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I feel honest enough,\u201d said Graham; and a genuine English blush\r\ncovered his face with its warm witness of sincerity. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he added, \u201cI\r\nwon\u2019t deny that in some respects you accuse me justly. In your presence I have\r\nalways had a thought which I dared not show you. I did truly regard you as the\r\npossessor of the most valuable thing the world owns for me. I wished for it: I\r\ntried for it. Sir, I ask for it now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJohn, you ask much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery much, sir. It must come from your generosity, as a gift; from your\r\njustice, as a reward. I can never earn it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAy! Listen to the Highland tongue!\u201d said Mr. Home. \u201cLook up, Polly! Answer\r\nthis \u2018braw wooer;\u2019 send him away!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe looked up. She shyly glanced at her eager, handsome suitor. She gazed\r\ntenderly on her furrowed sire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPapa, I love you both,\u201d said she; \u201cI can take care of you both. I need not\r\nsend Graham away\u2014he can live here; he will be no inconvenience,\u201d she alleged\r\nwith that simplicity of phraseology which at times was wont to make both her\r\nfather and Graham smile. They smiled now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe will be a prodigious inconvenience to me,\u201d still persisted Mr. Home. \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t want him, Polly, he is too tall; he is in my way. Tell him to march.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will get used to him, papa. He seemed exceedingly tall to me at first\u2014like\r\na tower when I looked up at him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have him\r\notherwise.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI object to him altogether, Polly; I can do without a son-in-law. I should\r\nnever have requested the best man in the land to stand to me in that relation.\r\nDismiss this gentleman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he has known you so long, papa, and suits you so well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuits me, forsooth! Yes; he has pretended to make my opinions and\r\ntastes his own. He has humoured me for good reasons. I think, Polly, you and I\r\nwill bid him good-by.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTill to-morrow only. Shake hands with Graham, papa.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo: I think not: I am not friends with him. Don\u2019t think to coax me between\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, indeed, you are friends. Graham, stretch out your right hand.\r\nPapa, put out yours. Now, let them touch. Papa, don\u2019t be stiff; close your\r\nfingers; be pliant\u2014there! But that is not a clasp\u2014it is a grasp? Papa, you\r\ngrasp like a vice. You crush Graham\u2019s hand to the bone; you hurt him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe must have hurt him; for he wore a massive ring, set round with brilliants,\r\nof which the sharp facets cut into Graham\u2019s flesh and drew blood: but pain only\r\nmade Dr. John laugh, as anxiety had made him smile.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome with me into my study,\u201d at last said Mr. Home to the doctor. They went.\r\nTheir intercourse was not long, but I suppose it was conclusive. The suitor had\r\nto undergo an interrogatory and a scrutiny on many things. Whether Dr. Bretton\r\nwas at times guileful in look and language or not, there was a sound foundation\r\nbelow. His answers, I understood afterwards, evinced both wisdom and integrity.\r\nHe had managed his affairs well. He had struggled through entanglements; his\r\nfortunes were in the way of retrieval; he proved himself in a position to\r\nmarry.\r\n\n\r\nOnce more the father and lover appeared in the library. M. de Bassompierre shut\r\nthe door; he pointed to his daughter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake her,\u201d he said. \u201cTake her, John Bretton: and may God deal with you as you\r\ndeal with her!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNot long after, perhaps a fortnight, I saw three persons, Count de\r\nBassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton, sitting on one seat, under\r\na low-spreading and umbrageous tree, in the grounds of the palace at Bois\r\nl\u2019Etang. They had come thither to enjoy a summer evening: outside the\r\nmagnificent gates their carriage waited to take them home; the green sweeps of\r\nturf spread round them quiet and dim; the palace rose at a distance, white as a\r\ncrag on Pentelicus; the evening star shone above it; a forest of flowering\r\nshrubs embalmed the climate of this spot; the hour was still and sweet; the\r\nscene, but for this group, was solitary.\r\n\n\r\nPaulina sat between the two gentlemen: while they conversed, her little hands\r\nwere busy at some work; I thought at first she was binding a nosegay. No; with\r\nthe tiny pair of scissors, glittering in her lap, she had severed spoils from\r\neach manly head beside her, and was now occupied in plaiting together the grey\r\nlock and the golden wave. The plait woven\u2014no silk-thread being at hand to bind\r\nit\u2014a tress of her own hair was made to serve that purpose; she tied it like a\r\nknot, prisoned it in a locket, and laid it on her heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cthere is an amulet made, which has virtue to keep you two\r\nalways friends. You can never quarrel so long as I wear this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAn amulet was indeed made, a spell framed which rendered enmity impossible. She\r\nwas become a bond to both, an influence over each, a mutual concord. From them\r\nshe drew her happiness, and what she borrowed, she, with interest, gave back.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there, indeed, such happiness on earth?\u201d I asked, as I watched the father,\r\nthe daughter, the future husband, now united\u2014all blessed and blessing.\r\n\n\r\nYes; it is so. Without any colouring of romance, or any exaggeration of fancy,\r\nit is so. Some real lives do\u2014for some certain days or years\u2014actually anticipate\r\nthe happiness of Heaven; and, I believe, if such perfect happiness is once felt\r\nby good people (to the wicked it never comes), its sweet effect is never wholly\r\nlost. Whatever trials follow, whatever pains of sickness or shades of death,\r\nthe glory precedent still shines through, cheering the keen anguish, and\r\ntinging the deep cloud.\r\n\n\r\nI will go farther. I do believe there are some human beings so born, so\r\nreared, so guided from a soft cradle to a calm and late grave, that no\r\nexcessive suffering penetrates their lot, and no tempestuous blackness\r\novercasts their journey. And often, these are not pampered, selfish beings, but\r\nNature\u2019s elect, harmonious and benign; men and women mild with charity, kind\r\nagents of God\u2019s kind attributes.\r\n\n\r\nLet me not delay the happy truth. Graham Bretton and Paulina de Bassompierre\r\nwere married, and such an agent did Dr. Bretton prove. He did not with time\r\ndegenerate; his faults decayed, his virtues ripened; he rose in intellectual\r\nrefinement, he won in moral profit: all dregs filtered away, the clear wine\r\nsettled bright and tranquil. Bright, too, was the destiny of his sweet wife.\r\nShe kept her husband\u2019s love, she aided in his progress\u2014of his happiness she was\r\nthe corner stone.\r\n\n\r\nThis pair was blessed indeed, for years brought them, with great prosperity,\r\ngreat goodness: they imparted with open hand, yet wisely. Doubtless they knew\r\ncrosses, disappointments, difficulties; but these were well borne. More than\r\nonce, too, they had to look on Him whose face flesh scarce can see and live:\r\nthey had to pay their tribute to the King of Terrors. In the fulness of years,\r\nM. de Bassompierre was taken: in ripe old age departed Louisa Bretton. Once\r\neven there rose a cry in their halls, of Rachel weeping for her children; but\r\nothers sprang healthy and blooming to replace the lost: Dr. Bretton saw himself\r\nlive again in a son who inherited his looks and his disposition; he had stately\r\ndaughters, too, like himself: these children he reared with a suave, yet a firm\r\nhand; they grew up according to inheritance and nurture.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, I do but speak the truth when I say that these two lives of Graham\r\nand Paulina were blessed, like that of Jacob\u2019s favoured son, with \u201cblessings of\r\nHeaven above, blessings of the deep that lies under.\u201d It was so, for God saw\r\nthat it was good.\r\n\n"}
{"39": "\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nCLOUD.\n\r\nBut it is not so for all. What then? His will be done, as done it surely will\r\nbe, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The impulse of creation\r\nforwards it; the strength of powers, seen and unseen, has its fulfilment in\r\ncharge. Proof of a life to come must be given. In fire and in blood, if\r\nneedful, must that proof be written. In fire and in blood do we trace the\r\nrecord throughout nature. In fire and in blood does it cross our own\r\nexperience. Sufferer, faint not through terror of this burning evidence. Tired\r\nwayfarer, gird up thy loins; look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother\r\nmourners, join in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world\r\nstretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be our cross\r\nour banner. For staff we have His promise, whose \u201cword is tried, whose way\r\nperfect:\u201d for present hope His providence, \u201cwho gives the shield of salvation,\r\nwhose gentleness makes great;\u201d for final home His bosom, who \u201cdwells in the\r\nheight of Heaven;\u201d for crowning prize a glory, exceeding and eternal. Let us so\r\nrun that we may obtain: let us endure hardness as good soldiers; let us finish\r\nour course, and keep the faith, reliant in the issue to come off more than\r\nconquerors: \u201cArt thou not from everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn a Thursday morning we were all assembled in classe, waiting for the lesson\r\nof literature. The hour was come; we expected the master.\r\n\n\r\nThe pupils of the first classe sat very still; the cleanly-written compositions\r\nprepared since the last lesson lay ready before them, neatly tied with ribbon,\r\nwaiting to be gathered by the hand of the Professor as he made his rapid round\r\nof the desks. The month was July, the morning fine, the glass-door stood ajar,\r\nthrough it played a fresh breeze, and plants, growing at the lintel, waved,\r\nbent, looked in, seeming to whisper tidings.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was not always quite punctual; we scarcely wondered at his being a\r\nlittle late, but we wondered when the door at last opened and, instead of him\r\nwith his swiftness and his fire, there came quietly upon us the cautious Madame\r\nBeck.\r\n\n\r\nShe approached M. Paul\u2019s desk; she stood before it; she drew round her the\r\nlight shawl covering her shoulders; beginning to speak in low, yet firm tones,\r\nand with a fixed gaze, she said, \u201cThis morning there will be no lesson of\r\nliterature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe second paragraph of her address followed, after about two minutes\u2019 pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week. I shall require at\r\nleast that space of time to find an efficient substitute for M. Emanuel.\r\nMeanwhile, it shall be our study to fill the blanks usefully.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour Professor, ladies,\u201d she went on, \u201cintends, if possible, duly to take\r\nleave of you. At the present moment he has not leisure for that ceremony. He is\r\npreparing for a long voyage. A very sudden and urgent summons of duty calls him\r\nto a great distance. He has decided to leave Europe for an indefinite time.\r\nPerhaps he may tell you more himself. Ladies, instead of the usual lesson with\r\nM. Emanuel, you will, this morning, read English with Mademoiselle Lucy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe bent her head courteously, drew closer the folds of her shawl, and passed\r\nfrom the classe.\r\n\n\r\nA great silence fell: then a murmur went round the room: I believe some pupils\r\nwept.\r\n\n\r\nSome time elapsed. The noise, the whispering, the occasional sobbing increased.\r\nI became conscious of a relaxation of discipline, a sort of growing disorder,\r\nas if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn, and that surveillance had\r\nvirtually left the classe. Habit and the sense of duty enabled me to rally\r\nquickly, to rise in my usual way, to speak in my usual tone, to enjoin, and\r\nfinally to establish quiet. I made the English reading long and close. I kept\r\nthem at it the whole morning. I remember feeling a sentiment of impatience\r\ntowards the pupils who sobbed. Indeed, their emotion was not of much value: it\r\nwas only an hysteric agitation. I told them so unsparingly. I half ridiculed\r\nthem. I was severe. The truth was, I could not do with their tears, or that\r\ngasping sound; I could not bear it. A rather weak-minded, low-spirited pupil\r\nkept it up when the others had done; relentless necessity obliged and assisted\r\nme so to accost her, that she dared not carry on the demonstration, that she\r\nwas forced to conquer the convulsion.\r\n\n\r\nThat girl would have had a right to hate me, except that, when school was over\r\nand her companions departing, I ordered her to stay, and when they were gone, I\r\ndid what I had never done to one among them before\u2014pressed her to my heart and\r\nkissed her cheek. But, this impulse yielded to, I speedily put her out of the\r\nclasse, for, upon that poignant strain, she wept more bitterly than ever.\r\n\n\r\nI filled with occupation every minute of that day, and should have liked to sit\r\nup all night if I might have kept a candle burning; the night, however, proved\r\na bad time, and left bad effects, preparing me ill for the next day\u2019s ordeal of\r\ninsufferable gossip. Of course this news fell under general discussion. Some\r\nlittle reserve had accompanied the first surprise: that soon wore off; every\r\nmouth opened; every tongue wagged; teachers, pupils, the very servants, mouthed\r\nthe name of \u201cEmanuel.\u201d He, whose connection with the school was contemporary\r\nwith its commencement, thus suddenly to withdraw! All felt it strange.\r\n\n\r\nThey talked so much, so long, so often, that, out of the very multitude of\r\ntheir words and rumours, grew at last some intelligence. About the third day I\r\nheard it said that he was to sail in a week; then\u2014that he was bound for the\r\nWest Indies. I looked at Madame Beck\u2019s face, and into her eyes, for disproof or\r\nconfirmation of this report; I perused her all over for information, but no\r\npart of her disclosed more than what was unperturbed and commonplace.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis secession was an immense loss to her,\u201d she alleged. \u201cShe did not know how\r\nshe should fill up the vacancy. She was so used to her kinsman, he had become\r\nher right hand; what should she do without him? She had opposed the step, but\r\nM. Paul had convinced her it was his duty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe said all this in public, in classe, at the dinner-table, speaking audibly\r\nto Z\u00e9lie St. Pierre.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy was it his duty?\u201d I could have asked her that. I had impulses to take hold\r\nof her suddenly, as she calmly passed me in classe, to stretch out my hand and\r\ngrasp her fast, and say, \u201cStop. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.\r\nWhy is it his duty to go into banishment?\u201d But Madame always addressed\r\nsome other teacher, and never looked at me, never seemed conscious I could have\r\na care in the question.\r\n\n\r\nThe week wore on. Nothing more was said about M. Emanuel coming to bid us\r\ngood-by; and none seemed anxious for his coming; none questioned whether or not\r\nhe would come; none betrayed torment lest he should depart silent and unseen;\r\nincessantly did they talk, and never, in all their talk, touched on this vital\r\npoint. As to Madame, she of course could see him, and say to him as much as she\r\npleased. What should she care whether or not he appeared in the\r\nschoolroom?\r\n\n\r\nThe week consumed. We were told that he was going on such a day, that his\r\ndestination was \u201cBasseterre in Guadaloupe:\u201d the business which called him\r\nabroad related to a friend\u2019s interests, not his own: I thought as much.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBasseterre in Guadaloupe.\u201d I had little sleep about this time, but whenever I\r\ndid slumber, it followed infallibly that I was quickly roused with a\r\nstart, while the words \u201cBasseterre,\u201d \u201cGuadaloupe,\u201d seemed pronounced over my\r\npillow, or ran athwart the darkness round and before me, in zigzag characters\r\nof red or violet light.\r\n\n\r\nFor what I felt there was no help, and how could I help feeling? M. Emanuel had\r\nbeen very kind to me of late days; he had been growing hourly better and\r\nkinder. It was now a month since we had settled the theological difference, and\r\nin all that time there had been no quarrel. Nor had our peace been the cold\r\ndaughter of divorce; we had not lived aloof; he had come oftener, he had talked\r\nwith me more than before; he had spent hours with me, with temper soothed, with\r\neye content, with manner home-like and mild. Kind subjects of conversation had\r\ngrown between us; he had inquired into my plans of life, and I had communicated\r\nthem; the school project pleased him; he made me repeat it more than once,\r\nthough he called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was over; the mutual\r\nunderstanding was settling and fixing; feelings of union and hope made\r\nthemselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection and deep esteem and dawning\r\ntrust had each fastened its bond.\r\n\n\r\nWhat quiet lessons I had about this time! No more taunts on my \u201cintellect,\u201d no\r\nmore menaces of grating public shows! How sweetly, for the jealous gibe, and\r\nthe more jealous, half-passionate eulogy, were substituted a mute, indulgent\r\nhelp, a fond guidance, and a tender forbearance which forgave but never\r\npraised. There were times when he would sit for many minutes and not speak at\r\nall; and when dusk or duty brought separation, he would leave with words like\r\nthese, \u201cIl est doux, le repos! Il est pr\u00e9cieux le calme bonheur!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOne evening, not ten short days since, he joined me whilst walking in my alley.\r\nHe took my hand. I looked up in his face. I thought he meant to arrest my\r\nattention.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBonne petite amie!\u201d said he, softly; \u201cdouce consolatrice!\u201d But through his\r\ntouch, and with his words, a new feeling and a strange thought found a course.\r\nCould it be that he was becoming more than friend or brother? Did his look\r\nspeak a kindness beyond fraternity or amity?\r\n\n\r\nHis eloquent look had more to say, his hand drew me forward, his interpreting\r\nlips stirred. No. Not now. Here into the twilight alley broke an interruption:\r\nit came dual and ominous: we faced two bodeful forms\u2014a woman\u2019s and a\r\npriest\u2019s\u2014Madame Beck and P\u00e8re Silas.\r\n\n\r\nThe aspect of the latter I shall never forget. On the first impulse it\r\nexpressed a Jean-Jacques sensibility, stirred by the signs of affection just\r\nsurprised; then, immediately, darkened over it the jaundice of ecclesiastical\r\njealousy. He spoke to me with unction. He looked on his pupil with\r\nsternness. As to Madame Beck, she, of course, saw nothing\u2014nothing; though her\r\nkinsman retained in her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner, not\r\nsuffering withdrawal, but clasping it close and fast.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing these incidents, that sudden announcement of departure had struck me\r\nat first as incredible. Indeed, it was only frequent repetition, and the\r\ncredence of the hundred and fifty minds round me, which forced on me its full\r\nacceptance. As to that week of suspense, with its blank, yet burning days,\r\nwhich brought from him no word of explanation\u2014I remember, but I cannot describe\r\nits passage.\r\n\n\r\nThe last day broke. Now would he visit us. Now he would come and speak his\r\nfarewell, or he would vanish mute, and be seen by us nevermore.\r\n\n\r\nThis alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living creature in\r\nthat school. All rose at the usual hour; all breakfasted as usual; all, without\r\nreference to, or apparent thought of their late Professor, betook themselves\r\nwith wonted phlegm to their ordinary duties.\r\n\n\r\nSo oblivious was the house, so tame, so trained its proceedings, so inexpectant\r\nits aspect\u2014I scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere thus stagnant, thus\r\nsmothering. Would no one lend me a voice? Had no one a wish, no one a word, no\r\none a prayer to which I could say\u2014Amen?\r\n\n\r\nI had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest trifle\u2014a treat, a holiday, a\r\nlesson\u2019s remission; they could not, they would not now band to besiege\r\nMadame Beck, and insist on a last interview with a Master who had certainly\r\nbeen loved, at least by some\u2014loved as they could love\u2014but, oh! what\r\nis the love of the multitude?\r\n\n\r\nI knew where he lived: I knew where he was to be heard of, or communicated\r\nwith; the distance was scarce a stone\u2019s-throw: had it been in the next\r\nroom\u2014unsummoned, I could make no use of my knowledge. To follow, to seek out,\r\nto remind, to recall\u2014for these things I had no faculty.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm: had he passed silent and\r\nunnoticing, silent and stirless should I have suffered him to go by.\r\n\n\r\nMorning wasted. Afternoon came, and I thought all was over. My heart trembled\r\nin its place. My blood was troubled in its current. I was quite sick, and\r\nhardly knew how to keep at my post\u2014or do my work. Yet the little world round me\r\nplodded on indifferent; all seemed jocund, free of care, or fear, or thought:\r\nthe very pupils who, seven days since, had wept hysterically at a startling\r\npiece of news, appeared quite to have forgotten the news, its import, and their\r\nemotion.\r\n\n\r\nA little before five o\u2019clock, the hour of dismissal, Madame Beck sent for me to\r\nher chamber, to read over and translate some English letter she had received,\r\nand to write for her the answer. Before settling to this work, I observed that\r\nshe softly closed the two doors of her chamber; she even shut and fastened the\r\ncasement, though it was a hot day, and free circulation of air was usually\r\nregarded by her as indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an\r\nalmost fierce distrust, suggested such question. Did she want to exclude sound?\r\nwhat sound?\r\n\n\r\nI listened as I had never listened before; I listened like the evening and\r\nwinter-wolf, snuffing the snow, scenting prey, and hearing far off the\r\ntraveller\u2019s tramp. Yet I could both listen and write. About the middle of the\r\nletter I heard\u2014what checked my pen\u2014a tread in the vestibule. No door-bell had\r\nrung; Rosine\u2014acting doubtless by orders\u2014had anticipated such r\u00e9veill\u00e9e. Madame\r\nsaw me halt. She coughed, made a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on\r\nto the classes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cProceed,\u201d said Madame; but my hand was fettered, my ear enchained, my thoughts\r\nwere carried off captive.\r\n\n\r\nThe classes formed another building; the hall parted them from the\r\ndwelling-house: despite distance and partition, I heard the sudden stir of\r\nnumbers, a whole division rising at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are putting away work,\u201d said Madame.\r\n\n\r\nIt was indeed the hour to put away work, but why that sudden hush\u2014that instant\r\nquell of the tumult?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWait, Madame\u2014I will see what it is.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd I put down my pen and left her. Left her? No: she would not be left:\r\npowerless to detain me, she rose and followed, close as my shadow. I turned on\r\nthe last step of the stair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre you coming, too?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said she; meeting my glance with a peculiar aspect\u2014a look, clouded, yet\r\nresolute.\r\n\n\r\nWe proceeded then, not together, but she walked in my steps.\r\n\n\r\nHe was come. Entering the first classe, I saw him. There, once more appeared\r\nthe form most familiar. I doubt not they had tried to keep him away, but he was\r\ncome.\r\n\n\r\nThe girls stood in a semicircle; he was passing round, giving his farewells,\r\npressing each hand, touching with his lips each cheek. This last ceremony,\r\nforeign custom permitted at such a parting\u2014so solemn, to last so long.\r\n\n\r\nI felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus; following and watching me\r\nclose; my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her breath; I became terribly\r\ngoaded.\r\n\n\r\nHe was approaching; the semicircle was almost travelled round; he came to the\r\nlast pupil; he turned. But Madame was before me; she had stepped out suddenly;\r\nshe seemed to magnify her proportions and amplify her drapery; she eclipsed me;\r\nI was hid. She knew my weakness and deficiency; she could calculate the degree\r\nof moral paralysis\u2014the total default of self-assertion\u2014with which, in a crisis,\r\nI could be struck. She hastened to her kinsman, she broke upon him volubly, she\r\nmastered his attention, she hurried him to the door\u2014the glass-door opening on\r\nthe garden. I think he looked round; could I but have caught his eye, courage,\r\nI think, would have rushed in to aid feeling, and there would have been a\r\ncharge, and, perhaps, a rescue; but already the room was all confusion, the\r\nsemicircle broken into groups, my figure was lost among thirty more\r\nconspicuous. Madame had her will; yes, she got him away, and he had not seen\r\nme; he thought me absent. Five o\u2019clock struck, the loud dismissal-bell rang,\r\nthe school separated, the room emptied.\r\n\n\r\nThere seems, to my memory, an entire darkness and distraction in some certain\r\nminutes I then passed alone\u2014a grief inexpressible over a loss unendurable.\r\nWhat should I do; oh! what should I do; when all my life\u2019s hope\r\nwas thus torn by the roots out of my riven, outraged heart?\r\n\n\r\nWhat I should have done, I know not, when a little child\u2014the least child\r\nin the school\u2014broke with its simplicity and its unconsciousness into the raging\r\nyet silent centre of that inward conflict.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d lisped the treble voice, \u201cI am to give you that. M. Paul said I\r\nwas to seek you all over the house, from the grenier to the cellar, and when I\r\nfound you, to give you that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd the child delivered a note; the little dove dropped on my knee, its olive\r\nleaf plucked off. I found neither address nor name, only these words:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not my intention to take leave of you when I said good-by to the rest,\r\nbut I hoped to see you in classe. I was disappointed. The interview is\r\ndeferred. Be ready for me. Ere I sail, I must see you at leisure, and speak\r\nwith you at length. Be ready; my moments are numbered, and, just now,\r\nmonopolized; besides, I have a private business on hand which I will not share\r\nwith any, nor communicate\u2014even to you.\u2014PAUL.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe ready?\u201d Then it must be this evening: was he not to go on the morrow? Yes;\r\nof that point I was certain. I had seen the date of his vessel\u2019s departure\r\nadvertised. Oh! I would be ready, but could that longed-for meeting\r\nreally be achieved? the time was so short, the schemers seemed so watchful, so\r\nactive, so hostile; the way of access appeared strait as a gully, deep as a\r\nchasm\u2014Apollyon straddled across it, breathing flames. Could my Greatheart\r\novercome? Could my guide reach me?\r\n\n\r\nWho might tell? Yet I began to take some courage, some comfort; it seemed to me\r\nthat I felt a pulse of his heart beating yet true to the whole throb of mine.\r\n\n\r\nI waited my champion. Apollyon came trailing his Hell behind him. I think if\r\nEternity held torment, its form would not be fiery rack, nor its nature\r\ndespair. I think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned,\r\nand will not set, an angel entered Hades\u2014stood, shone, smiled, delivered a\r\nprophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come, not\r\nnow, but at a day and hour unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur\r\nthe height and compass of his promise: spoke thus\u2014then towering, became a star,\r\nand vanished into his own Heaven. His legacy was suspense\u2014a worse boon than\r\ndespair.\r\n\n\r\nAll that evening I waited, trusting in the dove-sent olive-leaf, yet in the\r\nmidst of my trust, terribly fearing. My fear pressed heavy. Cold and peculiar,\r\nI knew it for the partner of a rarely-belied presentiment. The first hours\r\nseemed long and slow; in spirit I clung to the flying skirts of the last. They\r\npassed like drift cloud\u2014like the wrack scudding before a storm.\r\n\n\r\nThey passed. All the long, hot summer day burned away like a Yule-log; the\r\ncrimson of its close perished; I was left bent among the cool blue shades, over\r\nthe pale and ashen gleams of its night.\r\n\n\r\nPrayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates were all retired. I still\r\nremained in the gloomy first classe, forgetting, or at least disregarding,\r\nrules I had never forgotten or disregarded before.\r\n\n\r\nHow long I paced that classe I cannot tell; I must have been afoot many hours;\r\nmechanically had I moved aside benches and desks, and had made for myself a\r\npath down its length. There I walked, and there, when certain that the whole\r\nhousehold were abed, and quite out of hearing\u2014there, I at last wept. Reliant on\r\nNight, confiding in Solitude, I kept my tears sealed, my sobs chained, no\r\nlonger; they heaved my heart; they tore their way. In this house, what grief\r\ncould be sacred?\r\n\n\r\nSoon after eleven o\u2019clock\u2014a very late hour in the Rue Fossette\u2014the door\r\nunclosed, quietly but not stealthily; a lamp\u2019s flame invaded the moonlight;\r\nMadame Beck entered, with the same composed air, as if coming on an ordinary\r\noccasion, at an ordinary season. Instead of at once addressing me, she went to\r\nher desk, took her keys, and seemed to seek something: she loitered over this\r\nfeigned search long, too long. She was calm, too calm; my mood scarce endured\r\nthe pretence; driven beyond common range, two hours since I had left behind me\r\nwonted respects and fears. Led by a touch, and ruled by a word, under usual\r\ncircumstances, no yoke could now be borne\u2014no curb obeyed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is more than time for retirement,\u201d said Madame; \u201cthe rule of the house has\r\nalready been transgressed too long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame met no answer: I did not check my walk; when she came in my way, I put\r\nher out of it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me persuade you to calm, Meess; let me lead you to your chamber,\u201d said\r\nshe, trying to speak softly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I said; \u201cneither you nor another shall persuade or lead me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour bed shall be warmed. Goton is sitting up still. She shall make you\r\ncomfortable: she shall give you a sedative.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame,\u201d I broke out, \u201cyou are a sensualist. Under all your serenity, your\r\npeace, and your decorum, you are an undenied sensualist. Make your own bed warm\r\nand soft; take sedatives and meats, and drinks spiced and sweet, as much as you\r\nwill. If you have any sorrow or disappointment\u2014and, perhaps, you have\u2014nay, I\r\nknow you have\u2014seek your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources.\r\nLeave me, however. Leave me, I say!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must send another to watch you, Meess: I must send Goton.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me, and my life, and my\r\ntroubles. Oh, Madame! in your hand there is both chill and poison. You\r\nenvenom and you paralyze.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I done, Meess? You must not marry Paul. He cannot marry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDog in the manger!\u201d I said: for I knew she secretly wanted him, and had always\r\nwanted him. She called him \u201cinsupportable:\u201d she railed at him for a \u201cd\u00e9vot:\u201d\r\nshe did not love, but she wanted to marry, that she might bind him to her\r\ninterest. Deep into some of Madame\u2019s secrets I had entered\u2014I know not how: by\r\nan intuition or an inspiration which came to me\u2014I know not whence. In the\r\ncourse of living with her too, I had slowly learned, that, unless with an\r\ninferior, she must ever be a rival. She was my rival, heart and soul,\r\nthough secretly, under the smoothest bearing, and utterly unknown to all save\r\nher and myself.\r\n\n\r\nTwo minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the whole woman was in my power,\r\nbecause in some moods, such as the present\u2014in some stimulated states of\r\nperception, like that of this instant\u2014her habitual disguise, her mask and her\r\ndomino, were to me a mere network reticulated with holes; and I saw underneath\r\na being heartless, self-indulgent, and ignoble. She quietly retreated from me:\r\nmeek and self-possessed, though very uneasy, she said, \u201cIf I would not be\r\npersuaded to take rest, she must reluctantly leave me.\u201d Which she did\r\nincontinent, perhaps even more glad to get away, than I was to see her vanish.\r\n\n\r\nThis was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting, rencontre which ever\r\noccurred between me and Madame Beck: this short night-scene was never repeated.\r\nIt did not one whit change her manner to me. I do not know that she revenged\r\nit. I do not know that she hated me the worse for my fell candour. I think she\r\nbucklered herself with the secret philosophy of her strong mind, and resolved\r\nto forget what it irked her to remember. I know that to the end of our mutual\r\nlives there occurred no repetition of, no allusion to, that fiery passage.\r\n\n\r\nThat night passed: all nights\u2014even the starless night before dissolution\u2014must\r\nwear away. About six o\u2019clock, the hour which called up the household, I went\r\nout to the court, and washed my face in its cold, fresh well-water. Entering by\r\nthe carr\u00e9, a piece of mirror-glass, set in an oaken cabinet, repeated my image.\r\nIt said I was changed: my cheeks and lips were sodden white, my eyes were\r\nglassy, and my eyelids swollen and purple.\r\n\n\r\nOn rejoining my companions, I knew they all looked at me\u2014my heart seemed\r\ndiscovered to them: I believed myself self-betrayed. Hideously certain did it\r\nseem that the very youngest of the school must guess why and for whom I\r\ndespaired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIsabelle,\u201d the child whom I had once nursed in sickness, approached me. Would\r\nshe, too, mock me!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQue vous \u00eates p\u00e2le! Vous \u00eates donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!\u201d said she,\r\nputting her finger in her mouth, and staring with a wistful stupidity which at\r\nthe moment seemed to me more beautiful than the keenest intelligence.\r\n\n\r\nIsabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance: before\r\nthe day was over, I gathered cause of gratitude towards the whole blind\r\nhousehold. The multitude have something else to do than to read hearts and\r\ninterpret dark sayings. Who wills, may keep his own counsel\u2014be his own secret\u2019s\r\nsovereign. In the course of that day, proof met me on proof, not only that the\r\ncause of my present sorrow was unguessed, but that my whole inner life for the\r\nlast six months, was still mine only. It was not known\u2014it had not been\r\nnoted\u2014that I held in peculiar value one life among all lives. Gossip had passed\r\nme by; curiosity had looked me over; both subtle influences, hovering always\r\nround, had never become centred upon me. A given organization may live in a\r\nfull fever-hospital, and escape typhus. M. Emanuel had come and gone: I had\r\nbeen taught and sought; in season and out of season he had called me, and I had\r\nobeyed him: \u201cM. Paul wants Miss Lucy\u201d\u2014\u201cMiss Lucy is with M. Paul\u201d\u2014such had been\r\nthe perpetual bulletin; and nobody commented, far less condemned. Nobody\r\nhinted, nobody jested. Madame Beck read the riddle: none else resolved it. What\r\nI now suffered was called illness\u2014a headache: I accepted the baptism.\r\n\n\r\nBut what bodily illness was ever like this pain? This certainty that he was\r\ngone without a farewell\u2014this cruel conviction that fate and pursuing furies\u2014a\r\nwoman\u2019s envy and a priest\u2019s bigotry\u2014would suffer me to see him no more? What\r\nwonder that the second evening found me like the first\u2014untamed, tortured, again\r\npacing a solitary room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation?\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night\u2014she did not come near\r\nme: she sent Ginevra Fanshawe\u2014a more efficient agent for the purpose she could\r\nnot have employed. Ginevra\u2019s first words\u2014\u201cIs your headache very bad to-night?\u201d\r\n(for Ginevra, like the rest, thought I had a headache\u2014an intolerable headache\r\nwhich made me frightfully white in the face, and insanely restless in the\r\nfoot)\u2014her first words, I say, inspired the impulse to flee anywhere, so that it\r\nwere only out of reach. And soon, what followed\u2014plaints about her own\r\nheadaches\u2014completed the business.\r\n\n\r\nI went up-stairs. Presently I was in my bed\u2014my miserable bed\u2014haunted with quick\r\nscorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when another emissary\r\narrived: Goton came, bringing me something to drink. I was consumed with\r\nthirst\u2014I drank eagerly; the beverage was sweet, but I tasted a drug.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou,\u201d said Goton, as she received\r\nback the emptied cup.\r\n\n\r\nAh! the sedative had been administered. In fact, they had given me a strong\r\nopiate. I was to be held quiet for one night.\r\n\n\r\nThe household came to bed, the night-light was lit, the dormitory hushed. Sleep\r\nsoon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy supremacy: contented\r\nsovereign over heads and hearts which did not ache\u2014he passed by the unquiet.\r\n\n\r\nThe drug wrought. I know not whether Madame had overcharged or under-charged\r\nthe dose; its result was not that she intended. Instead of stupor, came\r\nexcitement. I became alive to new thought\u2014to reverie peculiar in colouring. A\r\ngathering call ran among the faculties, their bugles sang, their trumpets rang\r\nan untimely summons. Imagination was roused from her rest, and she came forth\r\nimpetuous and venturous. With scorn she looked on Matter, her mate\u2014\u201cRise!\u201d she\r\nsaid. \u201cSluggard! this night I will have my will; nor shalt thou\r\nprevail.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook forth and view the night!\u201d was her cry; and when I lifted the heavy blind\r\nfrom the casement close at hand\u2014with her own royal gesture, she showed me a\r\nmoon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.\r\n\n\r\nTo my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom, the narrow limits, the\r\noppressive heat of the dormitory, intolerable. She lured me to leave this den\r\nand follow her forth into dew, coolness, and glory.\r\n\n\r\nShe brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at midnight. Especially she\r\nshowed the park, the summer-park, with its long alleys all silent, lone and\r\nsafe; among these lay a huge stone basin\u2014that basin I knew, and beside which I\r\nhad often stood\u2014deep-set in the tree-shadows, brimming with cool water, clear,\r\nwith a green, leafy, rushy bed. What of all this? The park-gates were shut up,\r\nlocked, sentinelled: the place could not be entered.\r\n\n\r\nCould it not? A point worth considering; and while revolving it, I mechanically\r\ndressed. Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying still\u2014excited from head to\r\nfoot\u2014what could I do better than dress?\r\n\n\r\nThe gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no admission\r\nto the park?\r\n\n\r\nThe other day, in walking past, I had seen, without then attending to the\r\ncircumstance, a gap in the paling\u2014one stake broken down: I now saw this gap\r\nagain in recollection\u2014saw it very plainly\u2014the narrow, irregular aperture\r\nvisible between the stems of the lindens, planted orderly as a colonnade. A man\r\ncould not have made his way through that aperture, nor could a stout woman,\r\nperhaps not Madame Beck; but I thought I might: I fancied I should like to try,\r\nand once within, at this hour the whole park would be mine\u2014the moonlight,\r\nmidnight park!\r\n\n\r\nHow soundly the dormitory slept! What deep slumbers! What quiet breathing! How\r\nvery still the whole large house! What was the time? I felt restless to know.\r\nThere stood a clock in the classe below: what hindered me from venturing down\r\nto consult it? By such a moon, its large white face and jet black figures must\r\nbe vividly distinct.\r\n\n\r\nAs for hindrance to this step, there offered not so much as a creaking hinge or\r\na clicking latch. On these hot July nights, close air could not be tolerated,\r\nand the chamber-door stood wide open. Will the dormitory-planks sustain my\r\ntread untraitorous? Yes. I know wherever a board is loose, and will avoid it.\r\nThe oak staircase creaks somewhat as I descend, but not much:\u2014I am in the\r\ncarr\u00e9.\r\n\n\r\nThe great classe-doors are close shut: they are bolted. On the other hand, the\r\nentrance to the corridor stands open. The classes seem to my thought, great\r\ndreary jails, buried far back beyond thoroughfares, and for me, filled with\r\nspectral and intolerable Memories, laid miserable amongst their straw and their\r\nmanacles. The corridor offers a cheerful vista, leading to the high vestibule\r\nwhich opens direct upon the street.\r\n\n\r\nHush!\u2014the clock strikes. Ghostly deep as is the stillness of this convent, it\r\nis only eleven. While my ear follows to silence the hum of the last stroke, I\r\ncatch faintly from the built-out capital, a sound like bells or like a band\u2014a\r\nsound where sweetness, where victory, where mourning blend. Oh, to approach\r\nthis music nearer, to listen to it alone by the rushy basin! Let me go\u2014oh, let\r\nme go! What hinders, what does not aid freedom?\r\n\n\r\nThere, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my large hat, my shawl. There\r\nis no lock on the huge, heavy, porte-coch\u00e8re; there is no key to seek: it\r\nfastens with a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened from the outside, but\r\nwhich, from within, may be noiselessly withdrawn. Can I manage it? It yields to\r\nmy hand, yields with propitious facility. I wonder as that portal seems almost\r\nspontaneously to unclose\u2014I wonder as I cross the threshold and step on the\r\npaved street, wonder at the strange ease with which this prison has been\r\nforced. It seems as if I had been pioneered invisibly, as if some dissolving\r\nforce had gone before me: for myself, I have scarce made an effort.\r\n\n\r\nQuiet Rue Fossette! I find on this pavement that wanderer-wooing summer night\r\nof which I mused; I see its moon over me; I feel its dew in the air. But here I\r\ncannot stay; I am still too near old haunts: so close under the dungeon, I can\r\nhear the prisoners moan. This solemn peace is not what I seek, it is not what I\r\ncan bear: to me the face of that sky bears the aspect of a world\u2019s death. The\r\npark also will be calm\u2014I know, a mortal serenity prevails everywhere\u2014yet let me\r\nseek the park.\r\n\n\r\nI took a route well known, and went up towards the palatial and royal\r\nHaute-Ville; thence the music I had heard certainly floated; it was hushed now,\r\nbut it might re-waken. I went on: neither band nor bell music came to meet me;\r\nanother sound replaced it, a sound like a strong tide, a great flow, deepening\r\nas I proceeded. Light broke, movement gathered, chimes pealed\u2014to what was I\r\ncoming? Entering on the level of a Grande Place, I found myself, with the\r\nsuddenness of magic, plunged amidst a gay, living, joyous crowd.\r\n\n\r\nVillette is one blaze, one broad illumination; the whole world seems abroad;\r\nmoonlight and heaven are banished: the town, by her own flambeaux, beholds her\r\nown splendour\u2014gay dresses, grand equipages, fine horses and gallant riders\r\nthrong the bright streets. I see even scores of masks. It is a strange scene,\r\nstranger than dreams. But where is the park?\u2014I ought to be near it. In the\r\nmidst of this glare the park must be shadowy and calm\u2014there, at least,\r\nare neither torches, lamps, nor crowd?\r\n\n\r\nI was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with known\r\nfaces. Through the deep throng it could pass but slowly; the spirited horses\r\nfretted in their curbed ardour. I saw the occupants of that carriage well: me\r\nthey could not see, or, at least, not know, folded close in my large shawl,\r\nscreened with my straw hat (in that motley crowd no dress was noticeably\r\nstrange). I saw the Count de Bassompierre; I saw my godmother, handsomely\r\napparelled, comely and cheerful; I saw, too, Paulina Mary, compassed with the\r\ntriple halo of her beauty, her youth, and her happiness. In looking on her\r\ncountenance of joy, and eyes of festal light, one scarce remembered to note the\r\ngala elegance of what she wore; I know only that the drapery floating about her\r\nwas all white and light and bridal; seated opposite to her I saw Graham\r\nBretton; it was in looking up at him her aspect had caught its lustre\u2014the light\r\nrepeated in her eyes beamed first out of his.\r\n\n\r\nIt gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly, and I\r\ndid follow them, as I thought, to the park. I watched them alight\r\n(carriages were inadmissible) amidst new and unanticipated splendours. Lo! the\r\niron gateway, between the stone columns, was spanned by a flaming arch built of\r\nmassed stars; and, following them cautiously beneath that arch, where were\r\nthey, and where was I?\r\n\n\r\nIn a land of enchantment, a garden most gorgeous, a plain sprinkled with\r\ncoloured meteors, a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and golden fire\r\ngemming the foliage; a region, not of trees and shadow, but of strangest\r\narchitectural wealth\u2014of altar and of temple, of pyramid, obelisk, and sphinx:\r\nincredible to say, the wonders and the symbols of Egypt teemed throughout the\r\npark of Villette.\r\n\n\r\nNo matter that in five minutes the secret was mine\u2014the key of the mystery\r\npicked up, and its illusion unveiled\u2014no matter that I quickly recognised the\r\nmaterial of these solemn fragments\u2014the timber, the paint, and the\r\npasteboard\u2014these inevitable discoveries failed to quite destroy the charm, or\r\nundermine the marvel of that night. No matter that I now seized the explanation\r\nof the whole great f\u00eate\u2014a f\u00eate of which the conventual Rue Fossette had not\r\ntasted, though it had opened at dawn that morning, and was still in full vigour\r\nnear midnight.\r\n\n\r\nIn past days there had been, said history, an awful crisis in the fate of\r\nLabassecour, involving I know not what peril to the rights and liberties of her\r\ngallant citizens. Rumours of wars there had been, if not wars themselves; a\r\nkind of struggling in the streets\u2014a bustle\u2014a running to and fro, some rearing\r\nof barricades, some burgher-rioting, some calling out of troops, much\r\ninterchange of brickbats, and even a little of shot. Tradition held that\r\npatriots had fallen: in the old Basse-Ville was shown an enclosure, solemnly\r\nbuilt in and set apart, holding, it was said, the sacred bones of martyrs. Be\r\nthis as it may, a certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in\r\nhonour of the said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memory\u2014the\r\nmorning being given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste, the evening\r\ndevoted to spectacles, decorations, and illuminations, such as these I now saw.\r\n\n\r\nWhile looking up at the image of a white ibis, fixed on a column\u2014while\r\nfathoming the deep, torch-lit perspective of an avenue, at the close of which\r\nwas couched a sphinx\u2014I lost sight of the party which, from the middle of the\r\ngreat square, I had followed\u2014or, rather, they vanished like a group of\r\napparitions. On this whole scene was impressed a dream-like character: every\r\nshape was wavering, every movement floating, every voice\r\necho-like\u2014half-mocking, half-uncertain. Paulina and her friends being gone, I\r\nscarce could avouch that I had really seen them; nor did I miss them as guides\r\nthrough the chaos, far less regret them as protectors amidst the night.\r\n\n\r\nThat festal night would have been safe for a very child. Half the peasantry had\r\ncome in from the outlying environs of Villette, and the decent burghers were\r\nall abroad and around, dressed in their best. My straw-hat passed amidst cap\r\nand jacket, short petticoat, and long calico mantle, without, perhaps,\r\nattracting a glance; I only took the precaution to bind down the broad leaf\r\ngipsy-wise, with a supplementary ribbon\u2014and then I felt safe as if masked.\r\n\n\r\nSafe I passed down the avenues\u2014safe I mixed with the crowd where it was\r\ndeepest. To be still was not in my power, nor quietly to observe. I took a\r\nrevel of the scene; I drank the elastic night-air\u2014the swell of sound, the\r\ndubious light, now flashing, now fading. As to Happiness or Hope, they and I\r\nhad shaken hands, but just now\u2014I scorned Despair.\r\n\n\r\nMy vague aim, as I went, was to find the stone-basin, with its clear depth and\r\ngreen lining: of that coolness and verdure I thought, with the passionate\r\nthirst of unconscious fever. Amidst the glare, and hurry, and throng, and\r\nnoise, I still secretly and chiefly longed to come on that circular mirror of\r\ncrystal, and surprise the moon glassing therein her pearly front.\r\n\n\r\nI knew my route, yet it seemed as if I was hindered from pursuing it direct:\r\nnow a sight, and now a sound, called me aside, luring me down this alley and\r\ndown that. Already I saw the thick-planted trees which framed this tremulous\r\nand rippled glass, when, choiring out of a glade to the right, broke such a\r\nsound as I thought might be heard if Heaven were to open\u2014such a sound, perhaps,\r\nas was heard above the plain of Bethlehem, on the night of glad tidings.\r\n\n\r\nThe song, the sweet music, rose afar, but rushing swiftly on fast-strengthening\r\npinions\u2014there swept through these shades so full a storm of harmonies that, had\r\nno tree been near against which to lean, I think I must have dropped. Voices\r\nwere there, it seemed to me, unnumbered; instruments varied and\r\ncountless\u2014bugle, horn, and trumpet I knew. The effect was as a sea breaking\r\ninto song with all its waves.\r\n\n\r\nThe swaying tide swept this way, and then it fell back, and I followed its\r\nretreat. It led me towards a Byzantine building\u2014a sort of kiosk near the park\u2019s\r\ncentre. Round about stood crowded thousands, gathered to a grand concert in the\r\nopen air. What I had heard was, I think, a wild J\u00e4ger chorus; the night, the\r\nspace, the scene, and my own mood, had but enhanced the sounds and their\r\nimpression.\r\n\n\r\nHere were assembled ladies, looking by this light most beautiful: some of their\r\ndresses were gauzy, and some had the sheen of satin, the flowers and the blond\r\ntrembled, and the veils waved about their decorated bonnets, as that host-like\r\nchorus, with its greatly-gathering sound, sundered the air above them. Most of\r\nthese ladies occupied the little light park-chairs, and behind and beside them\r\nstood guardian gentlemen. The outer ranks of the crowd were made up of\r\ncitizens, plebeians and police.\r\n\n\r\nIn this outer rank I took my place. I rather liked to find myself the silent,\r\nunknown, consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short petticoat and the\r\nsabot; and only the distant gazer at the silk robe, the velvet mantle, and the\r\nplumed chapeau. Amidst so much life and joy, too, it suited me to be\r\nalone\u2014quite alone. Having neither wish nor power to force my way through a mass\r\nso close-packed, my station was on the farthest confines, where, indeed, I\r\nmight hear, but could see little.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle is not well placed,\u201d said a voice at my elbow. Who dared accost\r\nme, a being in a mood so little social? I turned, rather to repel than\r\nto reply. I saw a man\u2014a burgher\u2014an entire stranger, as I deemed him for one\r\nmoment, but the next, recognised in him a certain tradesman\u2014a bookseller, whose\r\nshop furnished the Rue Fossette with its books and stationery; a man notorious\r\nin our pensionnat for the excessive brittleness of his temper, and frequent\r\nsnappishness of his manner, even to us, his principal customers: but whom, for\r\nmy solitary self, I had ever been disposed to like, and had always found civil,\r\nsometimes kind; once, in aiding me about some troublesome little exchange of\r\nforeign money, he had done me a service. He was an intelligent man; under his\r\nasperity, he was a good-hearted man; the thought had sometimes crossed me, that\r\na part of his nature bore affinity to a part of M. Emanuel\u2019s (whom he knew\r\nwell, and whom I had often seen sitting on Miret\u2019s counter, turning over the\r\ncurrent month\u2019s publications); and it was in this affinity I read the\r\nexplanation of that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively regarded\r\nhim.\r\n\n\r\nStrange to say, this man knew me under my straw-hat and closely-folded shawl;\r\nand, though I deprecated the effort, he insisted on making a way for me through\r\nthe crowd, and finding me a better situation. He carried his disinterested\r\ncivility further; and, from some quarter, procured me a chair. Once and again,\r\nI have found that the most cross-grained are by no means the worst of mankind;\r\nnor the humblest in station, the least polished in feeling. This man, in his\r\ncourtesy, seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone; only a reason\r\nfor extending to me, as far as he could, a retiring, yet efficient attention.\r\nHaving secured me a place and a seat, he withdrew without asking a question,\r\nwithout obtruding a remark, without adding a superfluous word. No wonder that\r\nProfessor Emanuel liked to take his cigar and his lounge, and to read his\r\nfeuilleton in M. Miret\u2019s shop\u2014the two must have suited.\r\n\n\r\nI had not been seated five minutes, ere I became aware that chance and my\r\nworthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a familiar and\r\ndomestic group. Right before me sat the Brettons and de Bassompierres. Within\r\nreach of my hand\u2014had I chosen to extend it\u2014sat a figure like a fairy-queen,\r\nwhose array, lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested; whatever was not\r\nspotless white, being forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near, that, had I\r\nleaned forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet. They\r\nwere too near; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger, I felt\r\nuneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance.\r\n\n\r\nIt made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning to Mr. Home, and speaking out\r\nof a kind impulse of memory, said,\u2014\u201cI wonder what my steady little Lucy would\r\nsay to all this if she were here? I wish we had brought her, she would have\r\nenjoyed it much.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo she would, so she would, in her grave sensible fashion; it is a pity but we\r\nhad asked her,\u201d rejoined the kind gentleman; and added, \u201cI like to see her so\r\nquietly pleased; so little moved, yet so content.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDear were they both to me, dear are they to this day in their remembered\r\nbenevolence. Little knew they the rack of pain which had driven Lucy almost\r\ninto fever, and brought her out, guideless and reckless, urged and drugged to\r\nthe brink of frenzy. I had half a mind to bend over the elders\u2019 shoulders, and\r\nanswer their goodness with the thanks of my eyes. M. de Bassompierre did not\r\nwell know me, but I knew him, and honoured and admired his\r\nnature, with all its plain sincerity, its warm affection, and unconscious\r\nenthusiasm. Possibly I might have spoken, but just then Graham turned; he\r\nturned with one of his stately firm movements, so different from those, of a\r\nsharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him a throng, a hundred ranks\r\ndeep; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide its scrutiny\u2014why then did\r\nhe concentrate all on me\u2014oppressing me with the whole force of that full, blue,\r\nsteadfast orb? Why, if he would look, did not one glance satisfy him?\r\nwhy did he turn on his chair, rest his elbow on its back, and study me\r\nleisurely? He could not see my face, I held it down; surely, he could\r\nnot recognise me: I stooped, I turned, I would not be known. He rose, by\r\nsome means he contrived to approach, in two minutes he would have had my\r\nsecret: my identity would have been grasped between his, never tyrannous, but\r\nalways powerful hands. There was but one way to evade or to check him. I\r\nimplied, by a sort of supplicatory gesture, that it was my prayer to be let\r\nalone; after that, had he persisted, he would perhaps have seen the spectacle\r\nof Lucy incensed: not all that was grand, or good, or kind in him (and Lucy\r\nfelt the full amount) should have kept her quite tame, or absolutely\r\ninoffensive and shadowlike. He looked, but he desisted. He shook his handsome\r\nhead, but he was mute. He resumed his seat, nor did he again turn or disturb me\r\nby a glance, except indeed for one single instant, when a look, rather\r\nsolicitous than curious, stole my way\u2014speaking what somehow stilled my heart\r\nlike \u201cthe south-wind quieting the earth.\u201d Graham\u2019s thoughts of me were not\r\nentirely those of a frozen indifference, after all. I believe in that goodly\r\nmansion, his heart, he kept one little place under the sky-lights where Lucy\r\nmight have entertainment, if she chose to call. It was not so handsome as the\r\nchambers where he lodged his male friends; it was not like the hall where he\r\naccommodated his philanthropy, or the library where he treasured his science,\r\nstill less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was splendidly\r\nspread; yet, gradually, by long and equal kindness, he proved to me that he\r\nkept one little closet, over the door of which was written \u201cLucy\u2019s Room.\u201d I\r\nkept a place for him, too\u2014a place of which I never took the measure, either by\r\nrule or compass: I think it was like the tent of Peri-Banou. All my life long I\r\ncarried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet, released from that hold and\r\nconstriction, I know not but its innate capacity for expanse might have\r\nmagnified it into a tabernacle for a host.\r\n\n\r\nForbearing as he was to-night, I could not stay in this proximity; this\r\ndangerous place and seat must be given up: I watched my opportunity, rose, and\r\nstole away. He might think, he might even believe that Lucy was contained\r\nwithin that shawl, and sheltered under that hat; he never could be certain, for\r\nhe did not see my face.\r\n\n\r\nSurely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased? Had I not had\r\nenough of adventure? Did I not begin to flag, quail, and wish for safety under\r\na roof? Not so. I still loathed my bed in the school dormitory more than words\r\ncan express: I clung to whatever could distract thought. Somehow I felt, too,\r\nthat the night\u2019s drama was but begun, that the prologue was scarce spoken:\r\nthroughout this woody and turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery; actors and\r\nincidents unlooked-for, waited behind the scenes: I thought so foreboding told\r\nme as much.\r\n\n\r\nStraying at random, obeying the push of every chance elbow, I was brought to a\r\nquarter where trees planted in clusters, or towering singly, broke up somewhat\r\nthe dense packing of the crowd, and gave it a more scattered character. These\r\nconfines were far from the music, and somewhat aloof even from the lamps, but\r\nthere was sound enough to soothe, and with that full, high moon, lamps were\r\nscarce needed. Here had chiefly settled family-groups, burgher-parents; some of\r\nthem, late as was the hour, actually surrounded by their children, with whom it\r\nhad not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng.\r\n\n\r\nThree fine tall trees growing close, almost twined stem within stem, lifted a\r\nthick canopy of shade above a green knoll, crowned with a seat\u2014a seat which\r\nmight have held several, yet it seemed abandoned to one, the remaining members\r\nof the fortunate party in possession of this site standing dutifully round;\r\nyet, amongst this reverend circle was a lady, holding by the hand a little\r\ngirl.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I caught sight of this little girl, she was twisting herself round on her\r\nheel, swinging from her conductress\u2019s hand, flinging herself from side to side\r\nwith wanton and fantastic gyrations. These perverse movements arrested my\r\nattention, they struck me as of a character fearfully familiar. On close\r\ninspection, no less so appeared the child\u2019s equipment; the lilac silk pelisse,\r\nthe small swansdown boa, the white bonnet\u2014the whole holiday toilette, in short,\r\nwas the gala garb of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\r\nBeck\u2014and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Beck it was\u2014she, or an imp in her likeness.\r\n\n\r\nI might have taken this discovery as a thunder-clap, but such hyperbole would\r\nhave been premature; discovery was destined to rise more than one degree, ere\r\nit reached its climax.\r\n\n\r\nOn whose hand could the amiable D\u00e9sir\u00e9e swing thus selfishly, whose glove could\r\nshe tear thus recklessly, whose arm thus strain with impunity, or on the\r\nborders of whose dress thus turn and trample insolently, if not the hand,\r\nglove, arm, and robe of her lady-mother? And there, in an Indian shawl and a\r\npale-green crape bonnet\u2014there, fresh, portly, blithe, and pleasant\u2014there stood\r\nMadame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nCurious! I had certainly deemed Madame in her bed, and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e in her crib, at\r\nthis blessed minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the just, within the\r\nsacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue Fossette. Most certainly\r\nalso they did not picture \u201cMeess Lucie\u201d otherwise engaged; and here we all\r\nthree were taking our \u201c\u00e9bats\u201d in the f\u00eate-blazing park at midnight!\r\n\n\r\nThe fact was, Madame was only acting according to her quite justifiable wont. I\r\nremembered now I had heard it said among the teachers\u2014though without at the\r\ntime particularly noticing the gossip\u2014that often, when we thought Madame in her\r\nchamber, sleeping, she was gone, full-dressed, to take her pleasure at operas,\r\nor plays, or balls. Madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life, and took\r\ncare\u2014largely, though discreetly\u2014to season her existence with a relish of the\r\nworld.\r\n\n\r\nHalf a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about her. Amongst these, I was not\r\nslow to recognise two or three. There was her brother, M. Victor Kint; there\r\nwas another person, moustached and with long hair\u2014a calm, taciturn man, but\r\nwhose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I could not mark unmoved. Amidst\r\nreserve and phlegm, amidst contrasts of character and of countenance, something\r\nthere still was which recalled a face\u2014mobile, fervent, feeling\u2014a face\r\nchangeable, now clouded, and now alight\u2014a face from my world taken away, for my\r\neyes lost, but where my best spring-hours of life had alternated in shadow and\r\nin glow; that face, where I had often seen movements so near the signs of\r\ngenius\u2014that why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire, the thing,\r\nthe spirit, and the secret itself\u2014I could never tell. Yes\u2014this Josef\r\nEmanuel\u2014this man of peace\u2014reminded me of his ardent brother.\r\n\n\r\nBesides Messieurs Victor and Josef, I knew another of this party. This third\r\nperson stood behind and in the shade, his attitude too was stooping, yet his\r\ndress and bald white head made him the most conspicuous figure of the group. He\r\nwas an ecclesiastic: he was P\u00e8re Silas. Do not fancy, reader, that there was\r\nany inconsistency in the priest\u2019s presence at this f\u00eate. This was not\r\nconsidered a show of Vanity Fair, but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice.\r\nThe Church patronised it, even with ostentation. There were troops of priests\r\nin the park that night.\r\n\n\r\nP\u00e8re Silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant, the rustic bench and\r\nthat which sat upon it: a strange mass it was\u2014bearing no shape, yet\r\nmagnificent. You saw, indeed, the outline of a face, and features, but these\r\nwere so cadaverous and so strangely placed, you could almost have fancied a\r\nhead severed from its trunk, and flung at random on a pile of rich merchandise.\r\nThe distant lamp-rays glanced on clear pendants, on broad rings; neither the\r\nchasteness of moonlight, nor the distance of the torches, could quite subdue\r\nthe gorgeous dyes of the drapery. Hail, Madame Walravens! I think you looked\r\nmore witch-like than ever. And presently the good lady proved that she was\r\nindeed no corpse or ghost, but a harsh and hardy old woman; for, upon some\r\naggravation in the clamorous petition of D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Beck to her mother, to go to\r\nthe kiosk and take sweetmeats, the hunchback suddenly fetched her a resounding\r\nrap with her gold-knobbed cane.\r\n\n\r\nThere, then, were Madame Walravens, Madame Beck, P\u00e8re Silas\u2014the whole\r\nconjuration, the secret junta. The sight of them thus assembled did me good. I\r\ncannot say that I felt weak before them, or abashed, or dismayed. They\r\noutnumbered me, and I was worsted and under their feet; but, as yet, I was not\r\ndead.\r\n\n"}
{"40": "\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nOLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE.\n\r\nFascinated as by a basilisk with three heads, I could not leave this clique;\r\nthe ground near them seemed to hold my feet. The canopy of entwined trees held\r\nout shadow, the night whispered a pledge of protection, and an officious lamp\r\nflashed just one beam to show me an obscure, safe seat, and then vanished. Let\r\nme now briefly tell the reader all that, during the past dark fortnight, I have\r\nbeen silently gathering from Rumour, respecting the origin and the object of M.\r\nEmanuel\u2019s departure. The tale is short, and not new: its alpha is Mammon, and\r\nits omega Interest.\r\n\n\r\nIf Madame Walravens was hideous as a Hindoo idol, she seemed also to possess,\r\nin the estimation of these her votaries, an idol\u2019s consequence. The fact was,\r\nshe had been rich\u2014very rich; and though, for the present, without the command\r\nof money, she was likely one day to be rich again. At Basseterre, in\r\nGuadaloupe, she possessed a large estate, received in dowry on her marriage\r\nsixty years ago, sequestered since her husband\u2019s failure; but now, it was\r\nsupposed, cleared of claim, and, if duly looked after by a competent agent of\r\nintegrity, considered capable of being made, in a few years, largely\r\nproductive.\r\n\n\r\nP\u00e8re Silas took an interest in this prospective improvement for the sake of\r\nreligion and the church, whereof Magliore Walravens was a devout daughter.\r\nMadame Beck, distantly related to the hunchback and knowing her to be without\r\nfamily of her own, had long brooded over contingencies with a mother\u2019s\r\ncalculating forethought, and, harshly treated as she was by Madame Walravens,\r\nnever ceased to court her for interest\u2019s sake. Madame Beck and the priest were\r\nthus, for money reasons, equally and sincerely interested in the nursing of the\r\nWest Indian estate.\r\n\n\r\nBut the distance was great, and the climate hazardous. The competent and\r\nupright agent wanted, must be a devoted man. Just such a man had Madame\r\nWalravens retained for twenty years in her service, blighting his life, and\r\nthen living on him, like an old fungus; such a man had P\u00e8re Silas trained,\r\ntaught, and bound to him by the ties of gratitude, habit, and belief. Such a\r\nman Madame Beck knew, and could in some measure influence. \u201cMy pupil,\u201d said\r\nP\u00e8re Silas, \u201cif he remains in Europe, runs risk of apostacy, for he has become\r\nentangled with a heretic.\u201d Madame Beck made also her private comment, and\r\npreferred in her own breast her secret reason for desiring expatriation. The\r\nthing she could not obtain, she desired not another to win: rather would she\r\ndestroy it. As to Madame Walravens, she wanted her money and her land, and knew\r\nPaul, if he liked, could make the best and faithfullest steward: so the three\r\nself-seekers banded and beset the one unselfish. They reasoned, they appealed,\r\nthey implored; on his mercy they cast themselves, into his hands they\r\nconfidingly thrust their interests. They asked but two or three years of\r\ndevotion\u2014after that, he should live for himself: one of the number, perhaps,\r\nwished that in the meantime he might die.\r\n\n\r\nNo living being ever humbly laid his advantage at M. Emanuel\u2019s feet, or\r\nconfidingly put it into his hands, that he spurned the trust or repulsed the\r\nrepository. What might be his private pain or inward reluctance to leave\r\nEurope\u2014what his calculations for his own future\u2014none asked, or knew, or\r\nreported. All this was a blank to me. His conferences with his confessor I\r\nmight guess; the part duty and religion were made to play in the persuasions\r\nused, I might conjecture. He was gone, and had made no sign. There my knowledge\r\nclosed.\r\n\n\r\nWith my head bent, and my forehead resting on my hands, I sat amidst grouped\r\ntree-stems and branching brushwood. Whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours,\r\nI might hear, if I would; I was near enough; but for some time, there was\r\nscarce motive to attend. They gossiped about the dresses, the music, the\r\nilluminations, the fine night. I listened to hear them say, \u201cIt is calm weather\r\nfor his voyage; the Antigua\u201d (his ship) \u201cwill sail prosperously.\u201d\r\nNo such remark fell; neither the Antigua, nor her course, nor her\r\npassenger were named.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps the light chat scarcely interested old Madame Walravens more than it\r\ndid me; she appeared restless, turning her head now to this side, now that,\r\nlooking through the trees, and among the crowd, as if expectant of an arrival\r\nand impatient of delay. \u201cO\u00f9 sont-ils? Pourquoi ne viennent-ils?\u201d I heard her\r\nmutter more than once; and at last, as if determined to have an answer to her\r\nquestion\u2014which hitherto none seemed to mind, she spoke aloud this phrase\u2014a\r\nphrase brief enough, simple enough, but it sent a shock through me\u2014\u201cMessieurs\r\net mesdames,\u201d said she, \u201co\u00f9 donc est Justine Marie?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie!\u201d What was this? Justine Marie\u2014the dead nun\u2014where was she? Why,\r\nin her grave, Madame Walravens\u2014what can you want with her? You shall go to her,\r\nbut she shall not come to you.\r\n\n\r\nThus I should have answered, had the response lain with me, but nobody\r\nseemed to be of my mind; nobody seemed surprised, startled, or at a loss. The\r\nquietest commonplace answer met the strange, the dead-disturbing, the\r\nWitch-of-Endor query of the hunchback.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie,\u201d said one, \u201cis coming; she is in the kiosk; she will be here\r\npresently.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOut of this question and reply sprang a change in the chat\u2014chat it still\r\nremained, easy, desultory, familiar gossip. Hint, allusion, comment, went round\r\nthe circle, but all so broken, so dependent on references to persons not named,\r\nor circumstances not defined, that listen as intently as I would\u2014and I\r\ndid listen now with a fated interest\u2014I could make out no more\r\nthan that some scheme was on foot, in which this ghostly Justine Marie\u2014dead or\r\nalive\u2014was concerned. This family-junta seemed grasping at her somehow, for some\r\nreason; there seemed question of a marriage, of a fortune\u2014for whom I could not\r\nquite make out\u2014perhaps for Victor Kint, perhaps for Josef Emanuel\u2014both were\r\nbachelors. Once I thought the hints and jests rained upon a young fair-haired\r\nforeigner of the party, whom they called Heinrich M\u00fchler. Amidst all the\r\nbadinage, Madame Walravens still obtruded from time to time, hoarse,\r\ncross-grained speeches; her impatience being diverted only by an implacable\r\nsurveillance of D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, who could not stir but the old woman menaced her with\r\nher staff.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLa voil\u00e0!\u201d suddenly cried one of the gentlemen, \u201cvoil\u00e0 Justine Marie qui\r\narrive!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis moment was for me peculiar. I called up to memory the pictured nun on the\r\npanel; present to my mind was the sad love-story; I saw in thought the vision\r\nof the garret, the apparition of the alley, the strange birth of the berceau; I\r\nunderwent a presentiment of discovery, a strong conviction of coming\r\ndisclosure. Ah! when imagination once runs riot where do we stop? What winter\r\ntree so bare and branchless\u2014what way-side, hedge-munching animal so humble,\r\nthat Fancy, a passing cloud, and a struggling moonbeam, will not clothe it in\r\nspirituality, and make of it a phantom?\r\n\n\r\nWith solemn force pressed on my heart, the expectation of mystery breaking up:\r\nhitherto I had seen this spectre only through a glass darkly; now was I to\r\nbehold it face to face. I leaned forward; I looked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe comes!\u201d cried Josef Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nThe circle opened as if opening to admit a new and welcome member. At this\r\ninstant a torch chanced to be carried past; its blaze aided the pale moon in\r\ndoing justice to the crisis, in lighting to perfection the d\u00e9nouement pressing\r\non. Surely those near me must have felt some little of the anxiety I felt, in\r\ndegree so unmeted. Of that group the coolest must have \u201cheld his breath for a\r\ntime!\u201d As for me, my life stood still.\r\n\n\r\nIt is over. The moment and the nun are come. The crisis and the revelation are\r\npassed by.\r\n\n\r\nThe flambeau glares still within a yard, held up in a park-keeper\u2019s hand; its\r\nlong eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of the Expected\u2014there\u2014where\r\nshe stands full in my sight. What is she like? What does she wear? How does she\r\nlook? Who is she?\r\n\n\r\nThere are many masks in the park to-night, and as the hour wears late, so\r\nstrange a feeling of revelry and mystery begins to spread abroad, that scarce\r\nwould you discredit me, reader, were I to say that she is like the nun of the\r\nattic, that she wears black skirts and white head-clothes, that she looks the\r\nresurrection of the flesh, and that she is a risen ghost.\r\n\n\r\nAll falsities\u2014all figments! We will not deal in this gear. Let us be honest,\r\nand cut, as heretofore, from the homely web of truth.\r\n\n\nHomely, though, is an ill-chosen word. What I see is not precisely\r\nhomely. A girl of Villette stands there\u2014a girl fresh from her pensionnat. She\r\nis very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this country. She looks\r\nwell-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her cheeks are round, her eyes good;\r\nher hair is abundant. She is handsomely dressed. She is not alone; her escort\r\nconsists of three persons\u2014two being elderly; these she addresses as \u201cMon Oncle\u201d\r\nand \u201cMa Tante.\u201d She laughs, she chats; good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she\r\nlooks, at all points, the bourgeoise belle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Justine Marie;\u201d so much for ghosts and mystery: not that this last\r\nwas solved\u2014this girl certainly is not my nun: what I saw in the garret and\r\ngarden must have been taller by a span.\r\n\n\r\nWe have looked at the city belle; we have cursorily glanced at the respectable\r\nold uncle and aunt. Have we a stray glance to give to the third member of this\r\ncompany? Can we spare him a moment\u2019s notice? We ought to distinguish him so\r\nfar, reader; he has claims on us; we do not now meet him for the first time. I\r\nclasped my hands very hard, and I drew my breath very deep: I held in the cry,\r\nI devoured the ejaculation, I forbade the start, I spoke and I stirred no more\r\nthan a stone; but I knew what I looked on; through the dimness left in my eyes\r\nby many nights\u2019 weeping, I knew him. They said he was to sail by the\r\nAntigua. Madame Beck said so. She lied, or she had uttered what was once\r\ntruth, and failed to contradict it when it became false. The Antigua was\r\ngone, and there stood Paul Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\nWas I glad? A huge load left me. Was it a fact to warrant joy? I know not. Ask\r\nfirst what were the circumstances attendant on this respite? How far did this\r\ndelay concern me? Were there not those whom it might touch more nearly?\r\n\n\r\nAfter all, who may this young girl, this Justine Marie, be? Not a stranger,\r\nreader; she is known to me by sight; she visits at the Rue Fossette: she is\r\noften of Madame Beck\u2019s Sunday parties. She is a relation of both the Becks and\r\nWalravens; she derives her baptismal name from the sainted nun who would have\r\nbeen her aunt had she lived; her patronymic is Sauveur; she is an heiress and\r\nan orphan, and M. Emanuel is her guardian; some say her godfather.\r\n\n\r\nThe family junta wish this heiress to be married to one of their band\u2014which is\r\nit? Vital question\u2014which is it?\r\n\n\r\nI felt very glad now, that the drug administered in the sweet draught had\r\nfilled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable. I always,\r\nthrough my whole life, liked to penetrate to the real truth; I like seeking the\r\ngoddess in her temple, and handling the veil, and daring the dread glance. O\r\nTitaness among deities! the covered outline of thine aspect sickens often\r\nthrough its uncertainty, but define to us one trait, show us one lineament,\r\nclear in awful sincerity; we may gasp in untold terror, but with that gasp we\r\ndrink in a breath of thy divinity; our heart shakes, and its currents sway like\r\nrivers lifted by earthquake, but we have swallowed strength. To see and know\r\nthe worst is to take from Fear her main advantage.\r\n\n\r\nThe Walravens\u2019 party, augmented in numbers, now became very gay. The gentlemen\r\nfetched refreshments from the kiosk, all sat down on the turf under the trees;\r\nthey drank healths and sentiments; they laughed, they jested. M. Emanuel\r\nunderwent some raillery, half good-humoured, half, I thought, malicious,\r\nespecially on Madame Beck\u2019s part. I soon gathered that his voyage had been\r\ntemporarily deferred of his own will, without the concurrence, even against the\r\nadvice, of his friends; he had let the Antigua go, and had taken his\r\nberth in the Paul et Virginie, appointed to sail a fortnight later. It\r\nwas his reason for this resolve which they teased him to assign, and which he\r\nwould only vaguely indicate as \u201cthe settlement of a little piece of business\r\nwhich he had set his heart upon.\u201d What was this business? Nobody knew.\r\nYes, there was one who seemed partly, at least, in his confidence; a meaning\r\nlook passed between him and Justine Marie. \u201cLa petite va m\u2019aider\u2014n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d\r\nsaid he. The answer was prompt enough, God knows!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMais oui, je vous aiderai de tout mon c\u0153ur. Vous ferez de moi tout ce que\r\nvous voudrez, mon parrain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd this dear \u201cparrain\u201d took her hand and lifted it to his grateful lips. Upon\r\nwhich demonstration, I saw the light-complexioned young Teuton, Heinrich\r\nM\u00fchler, grow restless, as if he did not like it. He even grumbled a few words,\r\nwhereat M. Emanuel actually laughed in his face, and with the ruthless triumph\r\nof the assured conqueror, he drew his ward nearer to him.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was indeed very joyous that night. He seemed not one whit subdued by\r\nthe change of scene and action impending. He was the true life of the party; a\r\nlittle despotic, perhaps, determined to be chief in mirth, as well as in\r\nlabour, yet from moment to moment proving indisputably his right of leadership.\r\nHis was the wittiest word, the pleasantest anecdote, the frankest laugh.\r\nRestlessly active, after his manner, he multiplied himself to wait on all; but\r\noh! I saw which was his favourite. I saw at whose feet he lay on the turf, I\r\nsaw whom he folded carefully from the night air, whom he tended, watched, and\r\ncherished as the apple of his eye.\r\n\n\r\nStill, hint and raillery flew thick, and still I gathered that while M. Paul\r\nshould be absent, working for others, these others, not quite ungrateful, would\r\nguard for him the treasure he left in Europe. Let him bring them an Indian\r\nfortune: they would give him in return a young bride and a rich inheritance. As\r\nfor the saintly consecration, the vow of constancy, that was forgotten: the\r\nblooming and charming Present prevailed over the Past; and, at length, his nun\r\nwas indeed buried.\r\n\n\r\nThus it must be. The revelation was indeed come. Presentiment had not been\r\nmistaken in her impulse: there is a kind of presentiment which never is\r\nmistaken; it was I who had for a moment miscalculated; not seeing the true\r\nbearing of the oracle, I had thought she muttered of vision when, in truth, her\r\nprediction touched reality.\r\n\n\r\nI might have paused longer upon what I saw; I might have deliberated ere I drew\r\ninferences. Some, perhaps, would have held the premises doubtful, the proofs\r\ninsufficient; some slow sceptics would have incredulously examined ere they\r\nconclusively accepted the project of a marriage between a poor and unselfish\r\nman of forty, and his wealthy ward of eighteen; but far from me such shifts and\r\npalliatives, far from me such temporary evasion of the actual, such coward\r\nfleeing from the dread, the swift-footed, the all-overtaking Fact, such feeble\r\nsuspense of submission to her the sole sovereign, such paltering and faltering\r\nresistance to the Power whose errand is to march conquering and to conquer,\r\nsuch traitor defection from the TRUTH.\r\n\n\r\nNo. I hastened to accept the whole plan. I extended my grasp and took it all\r\nin. I gathered it to me with a sort of rage of haste, and folded it round me,\r\nas the soldier struck on the field folds his colours about his breast. I\r\ninvoked Conviction to nail upon me the certainty, abhorred while embraced, to\r\nfix it with the strongest spikes her strongest strokes could drive; and when\r\nthe iron had entered well my soul, I stood up, as I thought, renovated.\r\n\n\r\nIn my infatuation, I said, \u201cTruth, you are a good mistress to your faithful\r\nservants! While a Lie pressed me, how I suffered! Even when the Falsehood was\r\nstill sweet, still flattering to the fancy, and warm to the feelings, it wasted\r\nme with hourly torment. The persuasion that affection was won could not be\r\ndivorced from the dread that, by another turn of the wheel, it might be lost.\r\nTruth stripped away Falsehood, and Flattery, and Expectancy, and here I\r\nstand\u2014free!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNothing remained now but to take my freedom to my chamber, to carry it with me\r\nto my bed and see what I could make of it. The play was not yet, indeed, quite\r\nplayed out. I might have waited and watched longer that love-scene under the\r\ntrees, that sylvan courtship. Had there been nothing of love in the\r\ndemonstration, my Fancy in this hour was so generous, so creative, she could\r\nhave modelled for it the most salient lineaments, and given it the deepest life\r\nand highest colour of passion. But I would not look; I had fixed my\r\nresolve, but I would not violate my nature. And then\u2014something tore me so\r\ncruelly under my shawl, something so dug into my side, a vulture so strong in\r\nbeak and talon, I must be alone to grapple with it. I think I never felt\r\njealousy till now. This was not like enduring the endearments of Dr. John and\r\nPaulina, against which while I sealed my eyes and my ears, while I withdrew\r\nthence my thoughts, my sense of harmony still acknowledged in it a charm. This\r\nwas an outrage. The love born of beauty was not mine; I had nothing in common\r\nwith it: I could not dare to meddle with it, but another love, venturing\r\ndiffidently into life after long acquaintance, furnace-tried by pain, stamped\r\nby constancy, consolidated by affection\u2019s pure and durable alloy, submitted by\r\nintellect to intellect\u2019s own tests, and finally wrought up, by his own process,\r\nto his own unflawed completeness, this Love that laughed at Passion, his fast\r\nfrenzies and his hot and hurried extinction, in this Love I had a vested\r\ninterest; and whatever tended either to its culture or its destruction, I could\r\nnot view impassibly.\r\n\n\r\nI turned from the group of trees and the \u201cmerrie companie\u201d in its shade.\r\nMidnight was long past; the concert was over, the crowds were thinning. I\r\nfollowed the ebb. Leaving the radiant park and well-lit Haute-Ville (still well\r\nlit, this it seems was to be a \u201cnuit blanche\u201d in Villette), I sought the dim\r\nlower quarter.\r\n\n\r\nDim I should not say, for the beauty of moonlight\u2014forgotten in the park\u2014here\r\nonce more flowed in upon perception. High she rode, and calm and stainlessly\r\nshe shone. The music and the mirth of the f\u00eate, the fire and bright hues of\r\nthose lamps had out-done and out-shone her for an hour, but now, again, her\r\nglory and her silence triumphed. The rival lamps were dying: she held her\r\ncourse like a white fate. Drum, trumpet, bugle, had uttered their clangour, and\r\nwere forgotten; with pencil-ray she wrote on heaven and on earth records for\r\narchives everlasting. She and those stars seemed to me at once the types and\r\nwitnesses of truth all regnant. The night-sky lit her reign: like its\r\nslow-wheeling progress, advanced her victory\u2014that onward movement which has\r\nbeen, and is, and will be from eternity to eternity.\r\n\n\r\nThese oil-twinkling streets are very still: I like them for their lowliness and\r\npeace. Homeward-bound burghers pass me now and then, but these companies are\r\npedestrians, make little noise, and are soon gone. So well do I love Villette\r\nunder her present aspect, not willingly would I re-enter under a roof, but that\r\nI am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful close, and quietly\r\nregaining my bed in the great dormitory, before Madame Beck comes home.\r\n\n\r\nOnly one street lies between me and the Rue Fossette; as I enter it, for the\r\nfirst time, the sound of a carriage tears up the deep peace of this quarter. It\r\ncomes this way\u2014comes very fast. How loud sounds its rattle on the paved path!\r\nThe street is narrow, and I keep carefully to the causeway. The carriage\r\nthunders past, but what do I see, or fancy I see, as it rushes by? Surely\r\nsomething white fluttered from that window\u2014surely a hand waved a handkerchief.\r\nWas that signal meant for me? Am I known? Who could recognise me? That is not\r\nM. de Bassompierre\u2019s carriage, nor Mrs. Bretton\u2019s; and besides, neither the\r\nH\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy nor the ch\u00e2teau of La Terrasse lies in that direction. Well, I have\r\nno time for conjecture; I must hurry home.\r\n\n\r\nGaining the Rue Fossette, reaching the pensionnat, all there was still; no\r\nfiacre had yet arrived with Madame and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. I had left the great door ajar;\r\nshould I find it thus? Perhaps the wind or some other accident may have thrown\r\nit to with sufficient force to start the spring-bolt? In that case, hopeless\r\nbecame admission; my adventure must issue in catastrophe. I lightly pushed the\r\nheavy leaf; would it yield?\r\n\n\r\nYes. As soundless, as unresisting, as if some propitious genius had waited on a\r\nsesame-charm, in the vestibule within. Entering with bated breath, quietly\r\nmaking all fast, shoelessly mounting the staircase, I sought the dormitory, and\r\nreached my couch.\r\n\n\r\nAy! I reached it, and once more drew a free inspiration. The next moment, I\r\nalmost shrieked\u2014almost, but not quite, thank Heaven!\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the dormitory, throughout the house, there reigned at this hour the\r\nstillness of death. All slept, and in such hush, it seemed that none dreamed.\r\nStretched on the nineteen beds lay nineteen forms, at full-length and\r\nmotionless. On mine\u2014the twentieth couch\u2014nothing ought to have lain: I\r\nhad left it void, and void should have found it. What, then; do I see between\r\nthe half-drawn curtains? What dark, usurping shape, supine, long, and strange?\r\nIs it a robber who has made his way through the open street-door, and lies\r\nthere in wait? It looks very black, I think it looks\u2014not human. Can it be a\r\nwandering dog that has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither?\r\nWill it spring, will it leap out if I approach? Approach I must. Courage! One\r\nstep!\u2014\r\n\n\r\nMy head reeled, for by the faint night-lamp, I saw stretched on my bed the old\r\nphantom\u2014the NUN.\r\n\n\r\nA cry at this moment might have ruined me. Be the spectacle what it might, I\r\ncould afford neither consternation, scream, nor swoon. Besides, I was not\r\novercome. Tempered by late incidents, my nerves disdained hysteria. Warm from\r\nilluminations, and music, and thronging thousands, thoroughly lashed up by a\r\nnew scourge, I defied spectra. In a moment, without exclamation, I had rushed\r\non the haunted couch; nothing leaped out, or sprung, or stirred; all the\r\nmovement was mine, so was all the life, the reality, the substance, the force;\r\nas my instinct felt. I tore her up\u2014the incubus! I held her on high\u2014the goblin!\r\nI shook her loose\u2014the mystery! And down she fell\u2014down all around me\u2014down in\r\nshreds and fragments\u2014and I trode upon her.\r\n\n\r\nHere again\u2014behold the branchless tree, the unstabled Rosinante; the film of\r\ncloud, the flicker of moonshine. The long nun proved a long bolster dressed in\r\na long black stole, and artfully invested with a white veil. The garments in\r\nvery truth, strange as it may seem, were genuine nun\u2019s garments, and by some\r\nhand they had been disposed with a view to illusion. Whence came these\r\nvestments? Who contrived this artifice? These questions still remained. To the\r\nhead-bandage was pinned a slip of paper: it bore in pencil these mocking words\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe nun of the attic bequeaths to Lucy Snowe her wardrobe. She will be seen in\r\nthe Rue Fossette no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd what and who was she that had haunted me? She, I had actually seen three\r\ntimes. Not a woman of my acquaintance had the stature of that ghost. She was\r\nnot of a female height. Not to any man I knew could the machination, for a\r\nmoment, be attributed.\r\n\n\r\nStill mystified beyond expression, but as thoroughly, as suddenly, relieved\r\nfrom all sense of the spectral and unearthly; scorning also to wear out my\r\nbrain with the fret of a trivial though insoluble riddle, I just bundled\r\ntogether stole, veil, and bandages, thrust them beneath my pillow, lay down,\r\nlistened till I heard the wheels of Madame\u2019s home-returning fiacre, then\r\nturned, and worn out by many nights\u2019 vigils, conquered, too, perhaps, by the\r\nnow reacting narcotic, I deeply slept.\r\n\n"}
{"41": "\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nTHE HAPPY PAIR.\n\r\nThe day succeeding this remarkable Midsummer night, proved no common day. I do\r\nnot mean that it brought signs in heaven above, or portents on the earth\r\nbeneath; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena, to storm, flood, or\r\nwhirlwind. On the contrary: the sun rose jocund, with a July face. Morning\r\ndecked her beauty with rubies, and so filled her lap with roses, that they fell\r\nfrom her in showers, making her path blush: the Hours woke fresh as nymphs, and\r\nemptying on the early hills their dew-vials, they stepped out dismantled of\r\nvapour: shadowless, azure, and glorious, they led the sun\u2019s steeds on a burning\r\nand unclouded course.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, it was as fine a day as the finest summer could boast; but I doubt\r\nwhether I was not the sole inhabitant of the Rue Fossette, who cared or\r\nremembered to note this pleasant fact. Another thought busied all other heads;\r\na thought, indeed, which had its share in my meditations; but this master\r\nconsideration, not possessing for me so entire a novelty, so overwhelming a\r\nsuddenness, especially so dense a mystery, as it offered to the majority of my\r\nco-speculators thereon, left me somewhat more open than the rest to any\r\ncollateral observation or impression.\r\n\n\r\nStill, while walking in the garden, feeling the sunshine, and marking the\r\nblooming and growing plants, I pondered the same subject the whole house\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\n\r\nWhat subject?\r\n\n\r\nMerely this. When matins came to be said, there was a place vacant in the first\r\nrank of boarders. When breakfast was served, there remained a coffee-cup\r\nunclaimed. When the housemaid made the beds, she found in one, a bolster laid\r\nlengthwise, clad in a cap and night-gown; and when Ginevra Fanshawe\u2019s\r\nmusic-mistress came early, as usual, to give the morning lesson, that\r\naccomplished and promising young person, her pupil, failed utterly to be\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\n\r\nHigh and low was Miss Fanshawe sought; through length and breadth was the house\r\nransacked; vainly; not a trace, not an indication, not so much as a scrap of a\r\nbillet rewarded the search; the nymph was vanished, engulfed in the past night,\r\nlike a shooting star swallowed up by darkness.\r\n\n\r\nDeep was the dismay of surveillante teachers, deeper the horror of the\r\ndefaulting directress. Never had I seen Madame Beck so pale or so appalled.\r\nHere was a blow struck at her tender part, her weak side; here was damage done\r\nto her interest. How, too, had the untoward event happened? By what outlet had\r\nthe fugitive taken wing? Not a casement was found unfastened, not a pane of\r\nglass broken; all the doors were bolted secure. Never to this day has Madame\r\nBeck obtained satisfaction on this point, nor indeed has anybody else\r\nconcerned, save and excepting one, Lucy Snowe, who could not forget how, to\r\nfacilitate a certain enterprise, a certain great door had been drawn softly to\r\nits lintel, closed, indeed, but neither bolted nor secure. The thundering\r\ncarriage-and-pair encountered were now likewise recalled, as well as that\r\npuzzling signal, the waved handkerchief.\r\n\n\r\nFrom these premises, and one or two others, inaccessible to any but myself, I\r\ncould draw but one inference. It was a case of elopement. Morally certain on\r\nthis head, and seeing Madame Beck\u2019s profound embarrassment, I at last\r\ncommunicated my conviction. Having alluded to M. de Hamal\u2019s suit, I found, as I\r\nexpected, that Madame Beck was perfectly au fait to that affair. She had long\r\nsince discussed it with Mrs. Cholmondeley, and laid her own responsibility in\r\nthe business on that lady\u2019s shoulders. To Mrs. Cholmondeley and M. de\r\nBassompierre she now had recourse.\r\n\n\r\nWe found that the H\u00f4tel Cr\u00e9cy was already alive to what had happened. Ginevra\r\nhad written to her cousin Paulina, vaguely signifying hymeneal intentions;\r\ncommunications had been received from the family of de Hamal; M. de\r\nBassompierre was on the track of the fugitives. He overtook them too late.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the week, the post brought me a note. I may as well transcribe\r\nit; it contains explanation on more than one point:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u2018DEAR OLD TIM \u201c(short for Timon),\u2014\u201d I am off you see\u2014gone like a shot. Alfred\r\nand I intended to be married in this way almost from the first; we never meant\r\nto be spliced in the humdrum way of other people; Alfred has too much spirit\r\nfor that, and so have I\u2014Dieu merci! Do you know, Alfred, who used to call you\r\n\u2018the dragon,\u2019 has seen so much of you during the last few months, that he\r\nbegins to feel quite friendly towards you. He hopes you won\u2019t miss him now that\r\nhe has gone; he begs to apologize for any little trouble he may have given you.\r\nHe is afraid he rather inconvenienced you once when he came upon you in the\r\ngrenier, just as you were reading a letter seemingly of the most special\r\ninterest; but he could not resist the temptation to give you a start, you\r\nappeared so wonderfully taken up with your correspondent. En revanche, he says\r\nyou once frightened him by rushing in for a dress or a shawl, or some other\r\nchiffon, at the moment when he had struck a light, and was going to take a\r\nquiet whiff of his cigar, while waiting for me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you begin to comprehend by this time that M. le Comte de Hamal was the nun\r\nof the attic, and that he came to see your humble servant? I will tell you how\r\nhe managed it. You know he has the entr\u00e9e of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, where two or three of\r\nhis nephews, the sons of his eldest sister, Madame de Melcy, are students. You\r\nknow the court of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e is on the other side of the high wall bounding\r\nyour walk, the all\u00e9e d\u00e9fendue. Alfred can climb as well as he can dance or\r\nfence: his amusement was to make the escalade of our pensionnat by mounting,\r\nfirst the wall; then\u2014by the aid of that high tree overspreading the grand\r\nberceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the lower buildings of\r\nour premises\u2014he managed to scale the first classe and the grand salle. One\r\nnight, by the way, he fell out of this tree, tore down some of the branches,\r\nnearly broke his own neck, and after all, in running away, got a terrible\r\nfright, and was nearly caught by two people, Madame Beck and M. Emanuel, he\r\nthinks, walking in the alley. From the grande salle the ascent is not difficult\r\nto the highest block of building, finishing in the great garret. The skylight,\r\nyou know, is, day and night, left half open for air; by the skylight he\r\nentered. Nearly a year ago I chanced to tell him our legend of the nun; that\r\nsuggested his romantic idea of the spectral disguise, which I think you must\r\nallow he has very cleverly carried out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut for the nun\u2019s black gown and white veil, he would have been caught again\r\nand again both by you and that tiger-Jesuit, M. Paul. He thinks you both\r\ncapital ghost-seers, and very brave. What I wonder at is, rather your\r\nsecretiveness than your courage. How could you endure the visitations of that\r\nlong spectre, time after time, without crying out, telling everybody, and\r\nrousing the whole house and neighbourhood?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, and how did you like the nun as a bed-fellow? I dressed her up:\r\ndidn\u2019t I do it well? Did you shriek when you saw her: I should have gone mad;\r\nbut then you have such nerves!\u2014real iron and bend-leather! I believe you feel\r\nnothing. You haven\u2019t the same sensitiveness that a person of my constitution\r\nhas. You seem to me insensible both to pain and fear and grief. You are a real\r\nold Diogenes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, dear grandmother! and are you not mightily angry at my moonlight\r\nflitting and run away match? I assure you it is excellent fun, and I did it\r\npartly to spite that minx, Paulina, and that bear, Dr. John: to show them that,\r\nwith all their airs, I could get married as well as they. M. de Bassompierre\r\nwas at first in a strange fume with Alfred; he threatened a prosecution for\r\n\u2018d\u00e9tournement de mineur,\u2019 and I know not what; he was so abominably in earnest,\r\nthat I found myself forced to do a little bit of the melodramatic\u2014go down on my\r\nknees, sob, cry, drench three pocket-handkerchiefs. Of course, \u2018mon oncle\u2019 soon\r\ngave in; indeed, where was the use of making a fuss? I am married, and that\u2019s\r\nall about it. He still says our marriage is not legal, because I am not of age,\r\nforsooth! As if that made any difference! I am just as much married as if I\r\nwere a hundred. However, we are to be married again, and I am to have a\r\ntrousseau, and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to superintend it; and there are some\r\nhopes that M. de Bassompierre will give me a decent portion, which will be very\r\nconvenient, as dear Alfred has nothing but his nobility, native and hereditary,\r\nand his pay. I only wish uncle would do things unconditionally, in a generous,\r\ngentleman-like fashion; he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on\r\nAlfred\u2019s giving his written promise that he will never touch cards or dice from\r\nthe day it is paid down. They accuse my angel of a tendency to play: I don\u2019t\r\nknow anything about that, but I do know he is a dear, adorable creature.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot sufficiently extol the genius with which de Hamal managed our flight.\r\nHow clever in him to select the night of the f\u00eate, when Madame (for he knows\r\nher habits), as he said, would infallibly be absent at the concert in the park.\r\nI suppose you must have gone with her. I watched you rise and leave the\r\ndormitory about eleven o\u2019clock. How you returned alone, and on foot, I cannot\r\nconjecture. That surely was you we met in the narrow old Rue St. Jean?\r\nDid you see me wave my handkerchief from the carriage window?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAdieu! Rejoice in my good luck: congratulate me on my supreme happiness, and\r\nbelieve me, dear cynic and misanthrope, yours, in the best of health and\r\nspirits,\r\n\n\r\nGINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL,\r\nn\u00e9e FANSHAWE.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cP.S.\u2014Remember, I am a countess now. Papa, mamma, and the girls at home, will\r\nbe delighted to hear that. \u2018My daughter the Countess!\u2019 \u2018My sister the\r\nCountess!\u2019 Bravo! Sounds rather better than Mrs. John Bretton, hein?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn winding up Mistress Fanshawe\u2019s memoirs, the reader will no doubt expect to\r\nhear that she came finally to bitter expiation of her youthful levities. Of\r\ncourse, a large share of suffering lies in reserve for her future.\r\n\n\r\nA few words will embody my farther knowledge respecting her.\r\n\n\r\nI saw her towards the close of her honeymoon. She called on Madame Beck, and\r\nsent for me into the salon. She rushed into my arms laughing. She looked very\r\nblooming and beautiful: her curls were longer, her cheeks rosier than ever: her\r\nwhite bonnet and her Flanders veil, her orange-flowers and her bride\u2019s dress,\r\nbecame her mightily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have got my portion!\u201d she cried at once; (Ginevra ever stuck to the\r\nsubstantial; I always thought there was a good trading element in her\r\ncomposition, much as she scorned the \u201cbourgeoise;\u201d) \u201cand uncle de Bassompierre\r\nis quite reconciled. I don\u2019t mind his calling Alfred a \u2018nincompoop\u2019\u2014that\u2019s only\r\nhis coarse Scotch breeding; and I believe Paulina envies me, and Dr. John is\r\nwild with jealousy\u2014fit to blow his brains out\u2014and I\u2019m so happy! I really think\r\nI\u2019ve hardly anything left to wish for\u2014unless it be a carriage and an hotel,\r\nand, oh! I\u2014must introduce you to \u2018mon mari.\u2019 Alfred, come here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Alfred appeared from the inner salon, where he was talking to Madame Beck,\r\nreceiving the blended felicitations and reprimands of that lady. I was\r\npresented under my various names: the Dragon, Diogenes, and Timon. The young\r\nColonel was very polite. He made me a prettily-turned, neatly-worded apology,\r\nabout the ghost-visits, &c., concluding with saying that \u201cthe best excuse\r\nfor all his iniquities stood there!\u201d pointing to his bride.\r\n\n\r\nAnd then the bride sent him back to Madame Beck, and she took me to herself,\r\nand proceeded literally to suffocate me with her unrestrained spirits, her\r\ngirlish, giddy, wild nonsense. She showed her ring exultingly; she called\r\nherself Madame la Comtesse de Hamal, and asked how it sounded, a score of\r\ntimes. I said very little. I gave her only the crust and rind of my nature. No\r\nmatter she expected of me nothing better\u2014she knew me too well to look for\r\ncompliments\u2014my dry gibes pleased her well enough and the more impassible and\r\nprosaic my mien, the more merrily she laughed.\r\n\n\r\nSoon after his marriage, M. de Hamal was persuaded to leave the army as the\r\nsurest way of weaning him from certain unprofitable associates and habits; a\r\npost of attach\u00e9 was procured for him, and he and his young wife went abroad. I\r\nthought she would forget me now, but she did not. For many years, she kept up a\r\ncapricious, fitful sort of correspondence. During the first year or two, it was\r\nonly of herself and Alfred she wrote; then, Alfred faded in the background;\r\nherself and a certain, new comer prevailed; one Alfred Fanshawe de Bassompierre\r\nde Hamal began to reign in his father\u2019s stead. There were great boastings about\r\nthis personage, extravagant amplifications upon miracles of precocity, mixed\r\nwith vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic incredulity with which I\r\nreceived them. I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat it was to be a mother;\u201d \u201cunfeeling thing\r\nthat I was, the sensibilities of the maternal heart were Greek and Hebrew to\r\nme,\u201d and so on. In due course of nature this young gentleman took his degrees\r\nin teething, measles, hooping-cough: that was a terrible time for me\u2014the\r\nmamma\u2019s letters became a perfect shout of affliction; never woman was so put\r\nupon by calamity: never human being stood in such need of sympathy. I was\r\nfrightened at first, and wrote back pathetically; but I soon found out there\r\nwas more cry than wool in the business, and relapsed into my natural cruel\r\ninsensibility. As to the youthful sufferer, he weathered each storm like a\r\nhero. Five times was that youth \u201cin articulo mortis,\u201d and five times did he\r\nmiraculously revive.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of years there arose ominous murmurings against Alfred the First;\r\nM. de Bassompierre had to be appealed to, debts had to be paid, some of them of\r\nthat dismal and dingy order called \u201cdebts of honour;\u201d ignoble plaints and\r\ndifficulties became frequent. Under every cloud, no matter what its nature,\r\nGinevra, as of old, called out lustily for sympathy and aid. She had no notion\r\nof meeting any distress single-handed. In some shape, from some quarter or\r\nother, she was pretty sure to obtain her will, and so she got on\u2014fighting the\r\nbattle of life by proxy, and, on the whole, suffering as little as any human\r\nbeing I have ever known.\r\n\n"}
{"42": "\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nFAUBOURG CLOTILDE.\n\r\nMust I, ere I close, render some account of that Freedom and Renovation which I\r\nwon on the f\u00eate-night? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart companions I\r\nbrought home from the illuminated park bore the test of intimate acquaintance?\r\n\n\r\nI tried them the very next day. They had boasted their strength loudly when\r\nthey reclaimed me from love and its bondage, but upon my demanding deeds, not\r\nwords, some evidence of better comfort, some experience of a relieved\r\nlife\u2014Freedom excused himself, as for the present impoverished and disabled to\r\nassist; and Renovation never spoke; he had died in the night suddenly.\r\n\n\r\nI had nothing left for it then but to trust secretly that conjecture might have\r\nhurried me too fast and too far, to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of\r\nthe distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy. After a short and vain\r\nstruggle, I found myself brought back captive to the old rack of suspense, tied\r\ndown and strained anew.\r\n\n\r\nShall I yet see him before he goes? Will he bear me in mind? Does he purpose to\r\ncome? Will this day\u2014will the next hour bring him? or must I again assay that\r\ncorroding pain of long attent\u2014that rude agony of rupture at the close, that\r\nmute, mortal wrench, which, in at once uprooting hope and doubt, shakes life;\r\nwhile the hand that does the violence cannot be caressed to pity, because\r\nabsence interposes her barrier!\r\n\n\r\nIt was the Feast of the Assumption; no school was held. The boarders and\r\nteachers, after attending mass in the morning, were gone a long walk into the\r\ncountry to take their go\u00fbter, or afternoon meal, at some farm-house. I did not\r\ngo with them, for now but two days remained ere the Paul et Virginie\r\nmust sail, and I was clinging to my last chance, as the living waif of a wreck\r\nclings to his last raft or cable.\r\n\n\r\nThere was some joiners\u2019 work to do in the first classe, some bench or desk to\r\nrepair; holidays were often turned to account for the performance of these\r\noperations, which could not be executed when the rooms were filled with pupils.\r\nAs I sat solitary, purposing to adjourn to the garden and leave the coast\r\nclear, but too listless to fulfil my own intent, I heard the workmen coming.\r\n\n\r\nForeign artisans and servants do everything by couples: I believe it would take\r\ntwo Labassecourien carpenters to drive a nail. While tying on my bonnet, which\r\nhad hitherto hung by its ribbons from my idle hand, I vaguely and momentarily\r\nwondered to hear the step of but one \u201couvrier.\u201d I noted, too\u2014as captives in\r\ndungeons find sometimes dreary leisure to note the merest trifles\u2014that this man\r\nwore shoes, and not sabots: I concluded that it must be the master-carpenter,\r\ncoming to inspect before he sent his journeymen. I threw round me my scarf. He\r\nadvanced; he opened the door; my back was towards it; I felt a little thrill\u2014a\r\ncurious sensation, too quick and transient to be analyzed. I turned, I stood in\r\nthe supposed master-artisan\u2019s presence: looking towards the door-way, I saw it\r\nfilled with a figure, and my eyes printed upon my brain the picture of M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\nHundreds of the prayers with which we weary Heaven bring to the suppliant no\r\nfulfilment. Once haply in life, one golden gift falls prone in the lap\u2014one boon\r\nfull and bright, perfect from Fruition\u2019s mint.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel wore the dress in which he probably purposed to travel\u2014a surtout,\r\nguarded with velvet; I thought him prepared for instant departure, and yet I\r\nhad understood that two days were yet to run before the ship sailed. He looked\r\nwell and cheerful. He looked kind and benign: he came in with eagerness; he was\r\nclose to me in one second; he was all amity. It might be his bridegroom mood\r\nwhich thus brightened him. Whatever the cause, I could not meet his sunshine\r\nwith cloud. If this were my last moment with him, I would not waste it in\r\nforced, unnatural distance. I loved him well\u2014too well not to smite out of my\r\npath even Jealousy herself, when she would have obstructed a kind farewell. A\r\ncordial word from his lips, or a gentle look from his eyes, would do me good,\r\nfor all the span of life that remained to me; it would be comfort in the last\r\nstrait of loneliness; I would take it\u2014I would taste the elixir, and pride\r\nshould not spill the cup.\r\n\n\r\nThe interview would be short, of course: he would say to me just what he had\r\nsaid to each of the assembled pupils; he would take and hold my hand two\r\nminutes; he would touch my cheek with his lips for the first, last, only\r\ntime\u2014and then\u2014no more. Then, indeed, the final parting, then the wide\r\nseparation, the great gulf I could not pass to go to him\u2014across which, haply,\r\nhe would not glance, to remember me.\r\n\n\r\nHe took my hand in one of his, with the other he put back my bonnet; he looked\r\ninto my face, his luminous smile went out, his lips expressed something almost\r\nlike the wordless language of a mother who finds a child greatly and\r\nunexpectedly changed, broken with illness, or worn out by want. A check\r\nsupervened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPaul, Paul!\u201d said a woman\u2019s hurried voice behind, \u201cPaul, come into the salon;\r\nI have yet a great many things to say to you\u2014conversation for the whole day\u2014and\r\nso has Victor; and Josef is here. Come Paul, come to your friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck, brought to the spot by vigilance or an inscrutable instinct,\r\npressed so near, she almost thrust herself between me and M. Emanuel.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Paul!\u201d she reiterated, her eye grazing me with its hard ray like a steel\r\nstylet. She pushed against her kinsman. I thought he receded; I thought he\r\nwould go. Pierced deeper than I could endure, made now to feel what defied\r\nsuppression, I cried\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy heart will break!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat I felt seemed literal heart-break; but the seal of another fountain\r\nyielded under the strain: one breath from M. Paul, the whisper, \u201cTrust me!\u201d\r\nlifted a load, opened an outlet. With many a deep sob, with thrilling, with icy\r\nshiver, with strong trembling, and yet with relief\u2014I wept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLeave her to me; it is a crisis: I will give her a cordial, and it will pass,\u201d\r\nsaid the calm Madame Beck.\r\n\n\r\nTo be left to her and her cordial seemed to me something like being left to the\r\npoisoner and her bowl. When M. Paul answered deeply, harshly, and\r\nbriefly\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLaissez-moi!\u201d in the grim sound I felt a music strange, strong, but\r\nlife-giving.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLaissez-moi!\u201d he repeated, his nostrils opening, and his facial muscles all\r\nquivering as he spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut this will never do,\u201d said Madame, with sternness. More sternly rejoined\r\nher kinsman\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSortez d\u2019ici!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will send for P\u00e8re Silas: on the spot I will send for him,\u201d she threatened\r\npertinaciously.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFemme!\u201d cried the Professor, not now in his deep tones, but in his highest and\r\nmost excited key, \u201cFemme! sortez \u00e0 l\u2019instant!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was roused, and I loved him in his wrath with a passion beyond what I had\r\nyet felt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat you do is wrong,\u201d pursued Madame; \u201cit is an act characteristic of men of\r\nyour unreliable, imaginative temperament; a step impulsive, injudicious,\r\ninconsistent\u2014a proceeding vexatious, and not estimable in the view of persons\r\nof steadier and more resolute character.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou know not what I have of steady and resolute in me,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you\r\nshall see; the event shall teach you. Modeste,\u201d he continued less fiercely, \u201cbe\r\ngentle, be pitying, be a woman; look at this poor face, and relent. You know I\r\nam your friend, and the friend of your friends; in spite of your taunts, you\r\nwell and deeply know I may be trusted. Of sacrificing myself I made no\r\ndifficulty but my heart is pained by what I see; it must have and give\r\nsolace. Leave me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis time, in the \u201cleave me\u201d there was an intonation so bitter and so\r\nimperative, I wondered that even Madame Beck herself could for one moment delay\r\nobedience; but she stood firm; she gazed upon him dauntless; she met his eye,\r\nforbidding and fixed as stone. She was opening her lips to retort; I saw over\r\nall M. Paul\u2019s face a quick rising light and fire; I can hardly tell how he\r\nmanaged the movement; it did not seem violent; it kept the form of courtesy; he\r\ngave his hand; it scarce touched her I thought; she ran, she whirled from the\r\nroom; she was gone, and the door shut, in one second.\r\n\n\r\nThe flash of passion was all over very soon. He smiled as he told me to wipe my\r\neyes; he waited quietly till I was calm, dropping from time to time a stilling,\r\nsolacing word. Ere long I sat beside him once more myself\u2014re-assured, not\r\ndesperate, nor yet desolate; not friendless, not hopeless, not sick of life,\r\nand seeking death.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt made you very sad then to lose your friend?\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt kills me to be forgotten, Monsieur,\u201d I said. \u201cAll these weary days I have\r\nnot heard from you one word, and I was crushed with the possibility, growing to\r\ncertainty, that you would depart without saying farewell!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust I tell you what I told Modeste Beck\u2014that you do not know me? Must I show\r\nand teach you my character? You will have proof that I can be a firm\r\nfriend? Without clear proof this hand will not lie still in mine, it will not\r\ntrust my shoulder as a safe stay? Good. The proof is ready. I come to justify\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay anything, teach anything, prove anything, Monsieur; I can listen now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, in the first place, you must go out with me a good distance into the\r\ntown. I came on purpose to fetch you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout questioning his meaning, or sounding his plan, or offering the\r\nsemblance of an objection, I re-tied my bonnet: I was ready.\r\n\n\r\nThe route he took was by the boulevards: he several times made me sit down on\r\nthe seats stationed under the lime-trees; he did not ask if I was tired, but\r\nlooked, and drew his own conclusions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll these weary days,\u201d said he, repeating my words, with a gentle, kindly\r\nmimicry of my voice and foreign accent, not new from his lips, and of which the\r\nplayful banter never wounded, not even when coupled, as it often was, with the\r\nassertion, that however I might write his language, I spoke and\r\nalways should speak it imperfectly and hesitatingly. \u201c\u2018All these weary days\u2019 I\r\nhave not for one hour forgotten you. Faithful women err in this, that they\r\nthink themselves the sole faithful of God\u2019s creatures. On a very fervent and\r\nliving truth to myself, I, too, till lately scarce dared count, from any\r\nquarter; but\u2014\u2014look at me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI lifted my happy eyes: they were happy now, or they would have been no\r\ninterpreters of my heart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, after some seconds\u2019 scrutiny, \u201cthere is no denying that\r\nsignature: Constancy wrote it: her pen is of iron. Was the record painful?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSeverely painful,\u201d I said, with truth. \u201cWithdraw her hand, Monsieur; I can\r\nbear its inscribing force no more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElle est toute p\u00e2le,\u201d said he, speaking to himself; \u201ccette figure-l\u00e0 me fait\r\nmal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! I am not pleasant to look at\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not help saying this; the words came unbidden: I never remember the\r\ntime when I had not a haunting dread of what might be the degree of my outward\r\ndeficiency; this dread pressed me at the moment with special force.\r\n\n\r\nA great softness passed upon his countenance; his violet eyes grew suffused and\r\nglistening under their deep Spanish lashes: he started up; \u201cLet us walk on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo I displease your eyes much?\u201d I took courage to urge: the point had\r\nits vital import for me.\r\n\n\r\nHe stopped, and gave me a short, strong answer; an answer which silenced,\r\nsubdued, yet profoundly satisfied. Ever after that I knew what I was for\r\nhim; and what I might be for the rest of the world, I ceased painfully\r\nto care. Was it weak to lay so much stress on an opinion about appearance? I\r\nfear it might be; I fear it was; but in that case I must avow no light share of\r\nweakness. I must own great fear of displeasing\u2014a strong wish moderately to\r\nplease M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\nWhither we rambled, I scarce knew. Our walk was long, yet seemed short; the\r\npath was pleasant, the day lovely. M. Emanuel talked of his voyage\u2014he thought\r\nof staying away three years. On his return from Guadaloupe, he looked forward\r\nto release from liabilities and a clear course; and what did I purpose doing in\r\nthe interval of his absence? he asked. I had talked once, he reminded me, of\r\ntrying to be independent and keeping a little school of my own: had I dropped\r\nthe idea?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I had not: I was doing my best to save what would enable me to put it\r\nin practice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe did not like leaving me in the Rue Fossette; he feared I should miss him\r\nthere too much\u2014I should feel desolate\u2014I should grow sad\u2014?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was certain; but I promised to do my best to endure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d said he, speaking low, \u201cthere is another objection to your present\r\nresidence. I should wish to write to you sometimes: it would not be well to\r\nhave any uncertainty about the safe transmission of letters; and in the Rue\r\nFossette\u2014in short, our Catholic discipline in certain matters\u2014though\r\njustifiable and expedient\u2014might possibly, under peculiar circumstances, become\r\nliable to misapplication\u2014perhaps abuse.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut if you write,\u201d said I, \u201cI must have your letters; and I will\r\nhave them: ten directors, twenty directresses, shall not keep them from me. I\r\nam a Protestant: I will not bear that kind of discipline: Monsieur, I will\r\nnot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoucement\u2014doucement,\u201d rejoined he; \u201cwe will contrive a plan; we have our\r\nresources: soyez tranquille.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo speaking, he paused.\r\n\n\r\nWe were now returning from the long walk. We had reached the middle of a clean\r\nFaubourg, where the houses were small, but looked pleasant. It was before the\r\nwhite door-step of a very neat abode that M. Paul had halted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI call here,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\nHe did not knock, but taking from his pocket a key, he opened and entered at\r\nonce. Ushering me in, he shut the door behind us. No servant appeared. The\r\nvestibule was small, like the house, but freshly and tastefully painted; its\r\nvista closed in a French window with vines trained about the panes, tendrils,\r\nand green leaves kissing the glass. Silence reigned in this dwelling.\r\n\n\r\nOpening an inner door, M. Paul disclosed a parlour, or salon\u2014very tiny, but I\r\nthought, very pretty. Its delicate walls were tinged like a blush; its floor\r\nwas waxed; a square of brilliant carpet covered its centre; its small round\r\ntable shone like the mirror over its hearth; there was a little couch, a little\r\nchiffonni\u00e8re, the half-open, crimson-silk door of which, showed porcelain on\r\nthe shelves; there was a French clock, a lamp; there were ornaments in biscuit\r\nchina; the recess of the single ample window was filled with a green stand,\r\nbearing three green flower-pots, each filled with a fine plant glowing in\r\nbloom; in one corner appeared a gu\u00e9ridon with a marble top, and upon it a\r\nwork-box, and a glass filled with violets in water. The lattice of this room\r\nwas open; the outer air breathing through, gave freshness, the sweet violets\r\nlent fragrance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty, pretty place!\u201d said I. M. Paul smiled to see me so pleased.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMust we sit down here and wait?\u201d I asked in a whisper, half awed by the deep\r\npervading hush.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe will first peep into one or two other nooks of this nutshell,\u201d he replied.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDare you take the freedom of going all over the house?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I dare,\u201d said he, quietly.\r\n\n\r\nHe led the way. I was shown a little kitchen with a little stove and oven, with\r\nfew but bright brasses, two chairs and a table. A small cupboard held a\r\ndiminutive but commodious set of earthenware.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a coffee service of china in the salon,\u201d said M. Paul, as I looked at\r\nthe six green and white dinner-plates; the four dishes, the cups and jugs to\r\nmatch.\r\n\n\r\nConducted up the narrow but clean staircase, I was permitted a glimpse of two\r\npretty cabinets of sleeping-rooms; finally, I was once more led below, and we\r\nhalted with a certain ceremony before a larger door than had yet been opened.\r\n\n\r\nProducing a second key, M. Emanuel adjusted it to the lock of this door. He\r\nopened, put me in before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVoici!\u201d he cried.\r\n\n\r\nI found myself in a good-sized apartment, scrupulously clean, though bare,\r\ncompared with those I had hitherto seen. The well-scoured boards were\r\ncarpetless; it contained two rows of green benches and desks, with an alley\r\ndown the centre, terminating in an estrade, a teacher\u2019s chair and table; behind\r\nthem a tableau. On the walls hung two maps; in the windows flowered a few hardy\r\nplants; in short, here was a miniature classe\u2014complete, neat, pleasant.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a school then?\u201d said I. \u201cWho keeps it? I never heard of an establishment\r\nin this faubourg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you have the goodness to accept of a few prospectuses for distribution in\r\nbehalf of a friend of mine?\u201d asked he, taking from his surtout-pocket some\r\nquires of these documents, and putting them into my hand. I looked, I\r\nread\u2014printed in fair characters:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExternat de demoiselles. Num\u00e9ro 7, Faubourg Clotilde, Directrice, Mademoiselle\r\nLucy Snowe.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd what did I say to M. Paul Emanuel?\r\n\n\r\nCertain junctures of our lives must always be difficult of recall to memory.\r\nCertain points, crises, certain feelings, joys, griefs, and amazements, when\r\nreviewed, must strike us as things wildered and whirling, dim as a wheel fast\r\nspun.\r\n\n\r\nI can no more remember the thoughts or the words of the ten minutes succeeding\r\nthis disclosure, than I can retrace the experience of my earliest year of life:\r\nand yet the first thing distinct to me is the consciousness that I was speaking\r\nvery fast, repeating over and over again:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid you do this, M. Paul? Is this your house? Did you furnish it? Did you get\r\nthese papers printed? Do you mean me? Am I the directress? Is there another\r\nLucy Snowe? Tell me: say something.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut he would not speak. His pleased silence, his laughing down-look, his\r\nattitude, are visible to me now.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow is it? I must know all\u2014all,\u201d I cried.\r\n\n\r\nThe packet of papers fell on the floor. He had extended his hand, and I had\r\nfastened thereon, oblivious of all else.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! you said I had forgotten you all these weary days,\u201d said he. \u201cPoor old\r\nEmanuel! These are the thanks he gets for trudging about three mortal weeks\r\nfrom house-painter to upholsterer, from cabinet-maker to charwoman. Lucy and\r\nLucy\u2019s cot, the sole thoughts in his head!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI hardly knew what to do. I first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff, and\r\nthen. I stroked the hand it surrounded. It was his foresight, his goodness, his\r\nsilent, strong, effective goodness, that overpowered me by their proved\r\nreality. It was the assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like\r\na light from heaven; it was his\u2014I will dare to say it\u2014his fond, tender look,\r\nwhich now shook me indescribably. In the midst of all I forced myself to look\r\nat the practical.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe trouble!\u201d I cried, \u201cand the cost! Had you money, M. Paul?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlenty of money!\u201d said he heartily. \u201cThe disposal of my large teaching\r\nconnection put me in possession of a handsome sum with part of it I determined\r\nto give myself the richest treat that I have known or shall know.\r\nI like this. I have reckoned on this hour day and night lately. I would not\r\ncome near you, because I would not forestall it. Reserve is neither my virtue\r\nnor my vice. If I had put myself into your power, and you had begun with your\r\nquestions of look and lip\u2014Where have you been, M. Paul? What have you been\r\ndoing? What is your mystery?\u2014my solitary first and last secret would presently\r\nhave unravelled itself in your lap. Now,\u201d he pursued, \u201cyou shall live here and\r\nhave a school; you shall employ yourself while I am away; you shall think of me\r\nsometimes; you shall mind your health and happiness for my sake, and when I\r\ncome back\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere he left a blank.\r\n\n\r\nI promised to do all he told me. I promised to work hard and willingly. \u201cI will\r\nbe your faithful steward,\u201d I said; \u201cI trust at your coming the account will be\r\nready. Monsieur, monsieur, you are too good!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn such inadequate language my feelings struggled for expression: they could\r\nnot get it; speech, brittle and unmalleable, and cold as ice, dissolved or\r\nshivered in the effort. He watched me, still; he gently raised his hand to\r\nstroke my hair; it touched my lips in passing; I pressed it close, I paid it\r\ntribute. He was my king; royal for me had been that hand\u2019s bounty; to offer\r\nhomage was both a joy and a duty.\r\n\n\r\nThe afternoon hours were over, and the stiller time of evening shaded the quiet\r\nfaubourg. M. Paul claimed my hospitality; occupied and afoot since morning, he\r\nneeded refreshment; he said I should offer him chocolate in my pretty gold and\r\nwhite china service. He went out and ordered what was needful from the\r\nrestaurant; he placed the small gu\u00e9ridon and two chairs in the balcony outside\r\nthe French window under the screening vines. With what shy joy I accepted my\r\npart as hostess, arranged the salver, served the benefactor-guest.\r\n\n\r\nThis balcony was in the rear of the house, the gardens of the faubourg were\r\nround us, fields extended beyond. The air was still, mild, and fresh. Above the\r\npoplars, the laurels, the cypresses, and the roses, looked up a moon so lovely\r\nand so halcyon, the heart trembled under her smile; a star shone subject beside\r\nher, with the unemulous ray of pure love. In a large garden near us, a jet rose\r\nfrom a well, and a pale statue leaned over the play of waters.\r\n\n\r\nM. Paul talked to me. His voice was so modulated that it mixed harmonious with\r\nthe silver whisper, the gush, the musical sigh, in which light breeze, fountain\r\nand foliage intoned their lulling vesper:\r\n\n\r\nHappy hour\u2014stay one moment! droop those plumes, rest those wings; incline to\r\nmine that brow of Heaven! White Angel! let thy light linger; leave its\r\nreflection on succeeding clouds; bequeath its cheer to that time which needs a\r\nray in retrospect!\r\n\n\r\nOur meal was simple: the chocolate, the rolls, the plate of fresh summer fruit,\r\ncherries and strawberries bedded in green leaves formed the whole: but it was\r\nwhat we both liked better than a feast, and I took a delight inexpressible in\r\ntending M. Paul. I asked him whether his friends, P\u00e8re Silas and Madame Beck,\r\nknew what he had done\u2014whether they had seen my house?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMon amie,\u201d said he, \u201cnone knows what I have done save you and myself: the\r\npleasure is consecrated to us two, unshared and unprofaned. To speak truth,\r\nthere has been to me in this matter a refinement of enjoyment I would not make\r\nvulgar by communication. Besides\u201d (smiling) \u201cI wanted to prove to Miss Lucy\r\nthat I could keep a secret. How often has she taunted me with lack of\r\ndignified reserve and needful caution! How many times has she saucily\r\ninsinuated that all my affairs are the secret of Polichinelle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was true enough: I had not spared him on this point, nor perhaps on any\r\nother that was assailable. Magnificent-minded, grand-hearted, dear, faulty\r\nlittle man! You deserved candour, and from me always had it.\r\n\n\r\nContinuing my queries, I asked to whom the house belonged, who was my landlord,\r\nthe amount of my rent. He instantly gave me these particulars in writing; he\r\nhad foreseen and prepared all things.\r\n\n\r\nThe house was not M. Paul\u2019s\u2014that I guessed: he was hardly the man to become a\r\nproprietor; I more than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving\r\nfaculty; he could get, but not keep; he needed a treasurer. The tenement, then,\r\nbelonged to a citizen in the Basse-Ville\u2014a man of substance, M. Paul said; he\r\nstartled me by adding: \u201ca friend of yours, Miss Lucy, a person who has a most\r\nrespectful regard for you.\u201d And, to my pleasant surprise, I found the landlord\r\nwas none other than M. Miret, the short-tempered and kind-hearted bookseller,\r\nwho had so kindly found me a seat that eventful night in the park. It seems M.\r\nMiret was, in his station, rich, as well as much respected, and possessed\r\nseveral houses in this faubourg; the rent was moderate, scarce half of what it\r\nwould have been for a house of equal size nearer the centre of Villette.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d observed M. Paul, \u201cshould fortune not favour you, though I think\r\nshe will, I have the satisfaction to think you are in good hands; M. Miret will\r\nnot be extortionate: the first year\u2019s rent you have already in your savings;\r\nafterwards Miss Lucy must trust God, and herself. But now, what will you do for\r\npupils?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must distribute my prospectuses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight! By way of losing no time, I gave one to M. Miret yesterday. Should you\r\nobject to beginning with three petite bourgeoises, the Demoiselles Miret? They\r\nare at your service.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur, you forget nothing; you are wonderful. Object? It would become me\r\nindeed to object! I suppose I hardly expect at the outset to number aristocrats\r\nin my little day-school; I care not if they never come. I shall be proud to\r\nreceive M. Miret\u2019s daughters.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBesides these,\u201d pursued he, \u201canother pupil offers, who will come daily to take\r\nlessons in English; and as she is rich, she will pay handsomely. I mean my\r\ngod-daughter and ward, Justine Marie Sauveur.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhat is in a name?\u2014what in three words? Till this moment I had listened with\r\nliving joy\u2014I had answered with gleeful quickness; a name froze me; three words\r\nstruck me mute. The effect could not be hidden, and indeed I scarce tried to\r\nhide it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said M. Paul.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing! Your countenance changes: your colour and your very eyes fade.\r\nNothing! You must be ill; you have some suffering; tell me what.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had nothing to tell.\r\n\n\r\nHe drew his chair nearer. He did not grow vexed, though I continued silent and\r\nicy. He tried to win a word; he entreated with perseverance, he waited with\r\npatience.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Marie is a good girl,\u201d said he, \u201cdocile and amiable; not quick\u2014but you\r\nwill like her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think not. I think she must not come here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch was my speech.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you wish to puzzle me? Do you know her? But, in truth, there is\r\nsomething. Again you are pale as that statue. Rely on Paul Carlos; tell him the\r\ngrief.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHis chair touched mine; his hand, quietly advanced, turned me towards him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know Marie Justine?\u201d said he again.\r\n\n\r\nThe name re-pronounced by his lips overcame me unaccountably. It did not\r\nprostrate\u2014no, it stirred me up, running with haste and heat through my\r\nveins\u2014recalling an hour of quick pain, many days and nights of heart-sickness.\r\nNear me as he now sat, strongly and closely as he had long twined his life in\r\nmine\u2014far as had progressed, and near as was achieved our minds\u2019 and affections\u2019\r\nassimilation\u2014the very suggestion of interference, of heart-separation, could be\r\nheard only with a fermenting excitement, an impetuous throe, a disdainful\r\nresolve, an ire, a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the\r\nflame, nor any truth-accustomed human tongue curb the cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d I said: \u201cI want to tell you all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak, Lucy; come near; speak. Who prizes you, if I do not? Who is your\r\nfriend, if not Emanuel? Speak!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI spoke. All escaped from my lips. I lacked not words now; fast I narrated;\r\nfluent I told my tale; it streamed on my tongue. I went back to the night in\r\nthe park; I mentioned the medicated draught\u2014why it was given\u2014its goading\r\neffect\u2014how it had torn rest from under my head, shaken me from my couch,\r\ncarried me abroad with the lure of a vivid yet solemn fancy\u2014a summer-night\r\nsolitude on turf, under trees, near a deep, cool lakelet. I told the scene\r\nrealized; the crowd, the masques, the music, the lamps, the splendours, the\r\nguns booming afar, the bells sounding on high. All I had encountered I\r\ndetailed, all I had recognised, heard, and seen; how I had beheld and watched\r\nhimself: how I listened, how much heard, what conjectured; the whole history,\r\nin brief, summoned to his confidence, rushed thither, truthful, literal,\r\nardent, bitter.\r\n\n\r\nStill as I narrated, instead of checking, he incited me to proceed, he spurred\r\nme by the gesture, the smile, the half-word. Before I had half done, he held\r\nboth my hands, he consulted my eyes with a most piercing glance: there was\r\nsomething in his face which tended neither to calm nor to put me down; he\r\nforgot his own doctrine, he forsook his own system of repression when I most\r\nchallenged its exercise. I think I deserved strong reproof; but when have we\r\nour deserts? I merited severity; he looked indulgence. To my very self I seemed\r\nimperious and unreasonable, for I forbade Justine Marie my door and roof; he\r\nsmiled, betraying delight. Warm, jealous, and haughty, I knew not till now that\r\nmy nature had such a mood: he gathered me near his heart. I was full of faults;\r\nhe took them and me all home. For the moment of utmost mutiny, he reserved the\r\none deep spell of peace. These words caressed my ear:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLucy, take my love. One day share my life. Be my dearest, first on earth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe walked back to the Rue Fossette by moonlight\u2014such moonlight as fell on\r\nEden\u2014shining through the shades of the Great Garden, and haply gilding a path\r\nglorious for a step divine\u2014a Presence nameless. Once in their lives some men\r\nand women go back to these first fresh days of our great Sire and Mother\u2014taste\r\nthat grand morning\u2019s dew\u2014bathe in its sunrise.\r\n\n\r\nIn the course of the walk I was told how Justine Marie Sauveur had always been\r\nregarded with the affection proper to a daughter\u2014how, with M. Paul\u2019s consent,\r\nshe had been affianced for months to one Heinrich M\u00fchler, a wealthy young\r\nGerman merchant, and was to be married in the course of a year. Some of M.\r\nEmanuel\u2019s relations and connections would, indeed, it seems, have liked him to\r\nmarry her, with a view to securing her fortune in the family; but to himself\r\nthe scheme was repugnant, and the idea totally inadmissible.\r\n\n\r\nWe reached Madame Beck\u2019s door. Jean Baptiste\u2019s clock tolled nine. At this hour,\r\nin this house, eighteen months since, had this man at my side bent before me,\r\nlooked into my face and eyes, and arbitered my destiny. This very evening he\r\nhad again stooped, gazed, and decreed. How different the look\u2014how far otherwise\r\nthe fate!\r\n\n\r\nHe deemed me born under his star: he seemed to have spread over me its beam\r\nlike a banner. Once\u2014unknown, and unloved, I held him harsh and strange; the low\r\nstature, the wiry make, the angles, the darkness, the manner, displeased me.\r\nNow, penetrated with his influence, and living by his affection, having his\r\nworth by intellect, and his goodness by heart\u2014I preferred him before all\r\nhumanity.\r\n\n\r\nWe parted: he gave me his pledge, and then his farewell. We parted: the next\r\nday\u2014he sailed.\r\n\n"}
{"43": "\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nFINIS.\n\r\nMan cannot prophesy. Love is no oracle. Fear sometimes imagines a vain thing.\r\nThose years of absence! How had I sickened over their anticipation! The woe\r\nthey must bring seemed certain as death. I knew the nature of their course: I\r\nnever had doubt how it would harrow as it went. The juggernaut on his car\r\ntowered there a grim load. Seeing him draw nigh, burying his broad wheels in\r\nthe oppressed soil\u2014I, the prostrate votary\u2014felt beforehand the annihilating\r\ncraunch.\r\n\n\r\nStrange to say\u2014strange, yet true, and owning many parallels in life\u2019s\r\nexperience\u2014that anticipatory craunch proved all\u2014yes\u2014nearly all the\r\ntorture. The great Juggernaut, in his great chariot, drew on lofty, loud, and\r\nsullen. He passed quietly, like a shadow sweeping the sky, at noon. Nothing but\r\na chilling dimness was seen or felt. I looked up. Chariot and demon charioteer\r\nwere gone by; the votary still lived.\r\n\n\r\nM. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were the three happiest years of\r\nmy life. Do you scout the paradox? Listen. I commenced my school; I worked\u2014I\r\nworked hard. I deemed myself the steward of his property, and determined, God\r\nwilling, to render a good account. Pupils came\u2014burghers at first\u2014a higher class\r\nere long. About the middle of the second year an unexpected chance threw into\r\nmy hands an additional hundred pounds: one day I received from England a letter\r\ncontaining that sum. It came from Mr. Marchmont, the cousin and heir of my dear\r\nand dead mistress. He was just recovering from a dangerous illness; the money\r\nwas a peace-offering to his conscience, reproaching him in the matter of, I\r\nknow not what, papers or memoranda found after his kinswoman\u2019s death\u2014naming or\r\nrecommending Lucy Snowe. Mrs. Barrett had given him my address. How far his\r\nconscience had been sinned against, I never inquired. I asked no questions, but\r\ntook the cash and made it useful.\r\n\n\r\nWith this hundred pounds I ventured to take the house adjoining mine. I would\r\nnot leave that which M. Paul had chosen, in which he had left, and where he\r\nexpected again to find me. My externat became a pensionnat; that also\r\nprospered.\r\n\n\r\nThe secret of my success did not lie so much in myself, in any endowment, any\r\npower of mine, as in a new state of circumstances, a wonderfully changed life,\r\na relieved heart. The spring which moved my energies lay far away beyond seas,\r\nin an Indian isle. At parting, I had been left a legacy; such a thought for the\r\npresent, such a hope for the future, such a motive for a persevering, a\r\nlaborious, an enterprising, a patient and a brave course\u2014I could not\r\nflag. Few things shook me now; few things had importance to vex, intimidate, or\r\ndepress me: most things pleased\u2014mere trifles had a charm.\r\n\n\r\nDo not think that this genial flame sustained itself, or lived wholly on a\r\nbequeathed hope or a parting promise. A generous provider supplied bounteous\r\nfuel. I was spared all chill, all stint; I was not suffered to fear penury; I\r\nwas not tried with suspense. By every vessel he wrote; he wrote as he gave and\r\nas he loved, in full-handed, full-hearted plenitude. He wrote because he liked\r\nto write; he did not abridge, because he cared not to abridge. He sat down, he\r\ntook pen and paper, because he loved Lucy and had much to say to her; because\r\nhe was faithful and thoughtful, because he was tender and true. There was no\r\nsham and no cheat, and no hollow unreal in him. Apology never dropped her\r\nslippery oil on his lips\u2014never proffered, by his pen, her coward feints and\r\npaltry nullities: he would give neither a stone, nor an excuse\u2014neither a\r\nscorpion; nor a disappointment; his letters were real food that nourished,\r\nliving water that refreshed.\r\n\n\r\nAnd was I grateful? God knows! I believe that scarce a living being so\r\nremembered, so sustained, dealt with in kind so constant, honourable and noble,\r\ncould be otherwise than grateful to the death.\r\n\n\r\nAdherent to his own religion (in him was not the stuff of which is made the\r\nfacile apostate), he freely left me my pure faith. He did not tease nor tempt.\r\nHe said:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRemain a Protestant. My little English Puritan, I love Protestantism in you. I\r\nown its severe charm. There is something in its ritual I cannot receive myself,\r\nbut it is the sole creed for \u2018Lucy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll Rome could not put into him bigotry, nor the Propaganda itself make him a\r\nreal Jesuit. He was born honest, and not false\u2014artless, and not cunning\u2014a\r\nfreeman, and not a slave. His tenderness had rendered him ductile in a priest\u2019s\r\nhands, his affection, his devotedness, his sincere pious enthusiasm blinded his\r\nkind eyes sometimes, made him abandon justice to himself to do the work of\r\ncraft, and serve the ends of selfishness; but these are faults so rare to find,\r\nso costly to their owner to indulge, we scarce know whether they will not one\r\nday be reckoned amongst the jewels.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now the three years are past: M. Emanuel\u2019s return is fixed. It is Autumn;\r\nhe is to be with me ere the mists of November come. My school flourishes, my\r\nhouse is ready: I have made him a little library, filled its shelves with the\r\nbooks he left in my care: I have cultivated out of love for him (I was\r\nnaturally no florist) the plants he preferred, and some of them are yet in\r\nbloom. I thought I loved him when he went away; I love him now in another\r\ndegree: he is more my own.\r\n\n\r\nThe sun passes the equinox; the days shorten, the leaves grow sere; but\u2014he is\r\ncoming.\r\n\n\r\nFrosts appear at night; November has sent his fogs in advance; the wind takes\r\nits autumn moan; but\u2014he is coming.\r\n\n\r\nThe skies hang full and dark\u2014a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast\r\nthemselves into strange forms\u2014arches and broad radiations; there rise\r\nresplendent mornings\u2014glorious, royal, purple as monarch in his state; the\r\nheavens are one flame; so wild are they, they rival battle at its thickest\u2014so\r\nbloody, they shame Victory in her pride. I know some signs of the sky; I have\r\nnoted them ever since childhood. God watch that sail! Oh! guard it!\r\n\n\r\nThe wind shifts to the west. Peace, peace, Banshee\u2014\u201ckeening\u201d at every window!\r\nIt will rise\u2014it will swell\u2014it shrieks out long: wander as I may through the\r\nhouse this night, I cannot lull the blast. The advancing hours make it strong:\r\nby midnight, all sleepless watchers hear and fear a wild south-west storm. That\r\nstorm roared frenzied, for seven days. It did not cease till the Atlantic was\r\nstrewn with wrecks: it did not lull till the deeps had gorged their full of\r\nsustenance. Not till the destroying angel of tempest had achieved his perfect\r\nwork, would he fold the wings whose waft was thunder\u2014the tremor of whose plumes\r\nwas storm.\r\n\n\r\nPeace, be still! Oh! a thousand weepers, praying in agony on waiting shores,\r\nlistened for that voice, but it was not uttered\u2014not uttered till; when the hush\r\ncame, some could not feel it: till, when the sun returned, his light was night\r\nto some!\r\n\n\r\nHere pause: pause at once. There is enough said. Trouble no quiet, kind heart;\r\nleave sunny imaginations hope. Let it be theirs to conceive the delight of joy\r\nborn again fresh out of great terror, the rapture of rescue from peril, the\r\nwondrous reprieve from dread, the fruition of return. Let them picture union\r\nand a happy succeeding life.\r\n\n\r\nMadame Beck prospered all the days of her life; so did P\u00e8re Silas; Madame\r\nWalravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died. Farewell.\r\n\nTHE END.\n"}
